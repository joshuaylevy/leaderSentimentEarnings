YUKIO HATOYAMA, Japan's prime minister, likens his role to that of a conductor trying to achieve ""harmony""--one of his favourite words--from a pickup orchestra (for which read, novice cabinet). So far the result has been cacophony. Ministers have waged war in public and have floated ideas that, in some cases, are downright ludicrous. At times they have even challenged Mr Hatoyama's authority. 
To his supporters, this reflects a refreshingly open debate in a new ruling party after decades of cloistered dealmaking. When Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to power in September, it was largely because of voters' frustration at half a century of rule by the ""iron triangle"" of Liberal Democratic politicians, bureaucrats and big business. Mr Hatoyama promised a more open and genuinely democratic style of government.
But discord in the cabinet, and a woeful absence of discussion about the budget next year and beyond, have left many worried. Foreign allies are wondering what the new government stands for. Investors are beginning to vote with their feet, driving up Japanese government-bond yields.
The most glaring problem is a diplomatic one: a dispute in relations with America over an American air base in Okinawa, a southern island, which is the subject of a bilateral treaty that the Hatoyama administration wants to review (see Banyan). America has done itself few favours with the new government. In the run up to Barack Obama's visit to Japan on November 13th, the administration has at times treated its strongest ally in the region with the sort of bossiness that the DPJ came to power vowing to stand up to.
But disagreement within the Hatoyama government over whether the air base should be moved within the island, off it, or even out of Japan altogether has made matters worse. The foreign ministry's insistence on reviewing the treaty so soon after taking office has also distracted both sides from a more important topic: the need to recalibrate their alliance, which next year turns 50, in a way that better reflects post-cold-war realities. 
Mr Hatoyama's difficulties come, in part, from the DPJ's coalition partners. To build an upper-house majority before elections next summer, he joined forces with two small parties, the Social Democrats and the People's New Party, offering both their leaders cabinet positions. The pacifist Social Democrats oppose all American military bases in Japan, a view the DPJ does not share. 
The leader of the People's New Party is even more of a problem. An anti-capitalist maverick, Shizuka Kamei, who is banking and postal-reform minister, seems to be running an alternative government. His plan to force banks to offer a loan moratorium to small firms has irked Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, and rattled markets. Inflammatory comments claiming big business is responsible for a spate of suicides and murders in Japan have embarrassed the rest of the cabinet.
Yet Mr Kamei has been able to challenge Mr Hatoyama with impunity. ""If Prime Minister Hatoyama wants to fire me, go ahead. But he can't,"" he declares. When he drafted in a former civil servant to reverse the privatisation of the postal service, he got away with it, even though one of Mr Hatoyama's most popular campaign promises was to keep former mandarins out of plush jobs.
Those who know Mr Hatoyama say it is not his style to be dictatorial. He may also be sweating it out, hoping that success in the upper-house elections will enable him to eject his awkward bedfellows. But if Mr Hatoyama does not turn more assertive soon, says Gerald Curtis, a veteran Japan watcher at Columbia University in New York, ""the image of a government in disarray, pulling in different directions and spending time back-pedalling from half-baked or unbaked policy ideas, will grow stronger and undermine...support.""
And as if the cabinet is not causing enough headaches, Ichiro Ozawa, head of the DPJ and the man considered the ""shadow shogun"" in Japanese politics, is also throwing his weight around. On November 10th he attacked Christianity, calling it an ""exclusive and self-righteous religion"". Not a message likely to endear him to the visiting Americans. 
It may not feel like it while Mr Obama is in town, but Mr Hatoyama has an even more powerful constituency demanding reassurance: the bond market. Since he took office, analysts say derivatives markets have suggested there are growing fears among ""bond vigilantes"" of rising government-funding costs in a few years' time. Gross debt already stands at a staggering 180% of GDP. In a recent report, JPMorgan, an American bank, gave warning that the costs of coping with a shrinking and ageing population could push that ratio to 300% in a decade, and send debt-service costs soaring.
With the deficit in the current fiscal year expected to hit 10% of GDP, there are concerns that next year the government will be forced to raise its borrowing target above the current 44 trillion yen ($489 billion). This week Fitch Ratings said it may review Japan's debt rating if the government issues substantially more debt.
The concerns have flourished partly because there is so little clarity about future budgets. The DPJ promised to set up a new body, the National Strategy Bureau, to set medium-term fiscal goals, to be headed by the deputy prime minister, Naoto Kan. But nothing has been done about implementing this promise in parliament, though it was considered a priority on taking office.
Markets were somewhat reassured this week when Mr Fujii, the finance minister, acknowledged that rising bond yields were indeed a worry. But he has recently appeared to pin his hopes on a rebounding economy to raise tax revenues and on eliminating waste to cut the deficit. Neither can be counted on.
An economic rebound would anyway be a cyclical benefit, whereas there is pressure from many parts of the DPJ for a structural increase in spending in order to provide European-style welfare protection. Their voices may grow louder even as Mr Fujii tries to hold down borrowing. Mr Hatoyama will have the final say. Perhaps he needs to remember, amid cacophony, that some of the best conductors are despots.","The Democrats' debut has been worryingly unharmonious--and the ""bond vigilantes"" are starting to make groaning noises, too

IN ITS few months in office there have been doubts about the seriousness of the new team running the world's second-largest economy. Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, airily talks of healing Japan's fiscal crisis with fraternal politics. He has appointed a blathering anti-capitalist to oversee the banks. And businessmen complain that they rarely have a chance to meet him or his ministers. 
In the past fortnight, however, Japan's economic stewards appear to have woken up to the depth of the country's malaise, and to the need for them to do something about it. Their focus has been deflation--consumer prices started falling in April. The concerns have been exacerbated by a surging yen, which on November 27th reached its strongest level against the dollar in 14 years. 
On December 1st, under strong pressure from the government, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced it would launch a 10 trillion yen ($115 billion) short-term lending facility, with a fixed 0.1% interest rate, to boost liquidity and attempt to reverse deflation. The measure, worth just 2% of GDP, disappointed those in the financial markets who had hoped the BoJ would buy more government bonds as part of a concerted effort with the government to weaken the currency. 
It also raised worries about central-bank independence. Masaaki Shirakawa, the only candidate for BoJ governor last year to be supported by Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan, won immediate praise from the prime minister for his efforts--even though the markets were underwhelmed. For days the BoJ had been badgered by the government to resort to quantitative easing (a form of stimulus in which a defined sum of money is injected into the economy). Mr Shirakawa described the new lending facility as ""quantitative easing in a broad sense"". 
For all the concerns about the BoJ, however, many observers welcomed signs that the administration was beginning to take a lead on the matter. At last it is beginning to resemble a government endeavouring to wield power. On December 2nd Mr Hatoyama promised trade-union leaders that the government would step up its own pump-priming measures by introducing a supplementary budget in the new year. News reports suggested it would be worth at least 4 trillion yen, which is much more than had been expected. 
Encouragingly, the deputy prime minister, Naoto Kan, who had been selected by Mr Hatoyama to work out a medium-term fiscal strategy for Japan, has at last emerged from the shadows to lead the anti-deflation brigade. His strong voice on the issue has helped unify the cabinet. It is not yet clear, however, that he has the courage to orchestrate the structural reforms Japan so badly needs. 
Japan's economic problems are deeply entrenched and Asia's economic recovery is still fragile. Moreover, some of the plans hatched by the Hatoyama administration to revive the economy look disturbingly anti-business. But identifying deflation as a big problem is a hopeful sign. Even if the authorities have not launched an effective joint effort to weaken the yen this week, they have at least served notice that they could eventually do so.","The new government begins to get to grips with the ailing economy

BETWEEN them, they won less than 3% of the vote in the August election for the lower house of the Diet, or parliament. In the 242-seat upper house, they hold just ten seats. Both are led by loose cannons, one an anti-capitalist, the other a liberal feminist. So why, Japan's ruling party is being asked, are its two tiny coalition partners able to hold it--and by extension the management of the world's second-largest economy--to ransom?
This is a question of growing importance for Yukio Hatoyama, the fledgling prime minister. In an opinion poll on December 7th, the main reason given for the party's falling popularity (still a robust 59%) was his lack of leadership. This month he has allowed the two cabinet members appointed from his Democratic Party's coalition partners to mount direct challenges to his authority on the economy and foreign policy.
One of them, Shizuka Kamei, the minister for postal reform, boycotted a cabinet meeting on December 4th at which a new fiscal-stimulus package was to be ratified, saying the package was not big enough. That delayed its approval until December 8th, when it was increased fractionally to {Yen}7.2 trillion ($80 billion).
Mr Kamei's intransigence incensed Naoto Kan, the deputy prime minister. ""We are a three-party coalition, but at the same time this is the Hatoyama administration, not a Kamei-led one,"" he reportedly hissed at Mr Kamei in a cabinet meeting. 
Meanwhile, another coalition-party cabinet member, Mizuho Fukushima, threatened on December 3rd to resign from the government unless it forced an American military base to leave Okinawa, a Japanese island south of the mainland. The base had been the subject of delicate talks with the Obama administration, which argues that the future of the Futenma marine base on Okinawa is enshrined in a 2006 bilateral agreement. On December 8th Japan said it had suspended the talks, partly because of the coalition issue.
The frustrations led Richard Armitage, a former American deputy secretary of state, to ask in Tokyo this week whether keeping a coalition together was more important than maintaining an American-Japan alliance. ""It's like the tail wagging the dog,"" Uichiro Niwa, chairman of Itochu, a large trading company, told a conference in Tokyo organised by The Economist.
Economists are also concerned, not least because third-quarter growth was revised sharply downward, to 1.3% from an annualised 4.8%, on December 9th. Instead of focusing on fiscal-stimulus measures in the latest session of the Diet, the government chose instead to back a controversial bill sponsored by Mr Kamei that would enable small companies to delay debt payments to banks. That means this week's additional spending plans will not make it through parliament until next year, and so, says Kyohei Morita, chief economist in Japan for Barclays Capital, they may not have any effect until economic growth has slowed even further. 
For its part, the ruling party argues that it is important to keep the coalition intact until upper-house elections next summer when it hopes to win at least seven more seats. That would give it a majority in both chambers, and hence greater freedom to pursue its own agenda. But since its so-called partners seem so determined to undermine that agenda, the strategy seems, at the very least, a dangerous gamble.","The DPJ 's fractious coalition partners disrupt economic and foreign policy

Hirohisa Fujii resigned as Japan's finance minister, citing bad health. His departure, however, was widely linked to an alleged feud with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan and a big influence over the prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama. Mr Hatoyama named his deputy, Naoto Kan, who has little experience of economic policy, as the new finance minister.

After some hesitation Mr Hatoyama accepted Mr Fujii's resignation. He replaced him with Naoto Kan, the deputy prime minister.

Increasingly, the ""shadow shogun"", as he is known, is stepping into the limelight.
The incident that appears to have slighted Mr Fujii came during budget wrangling last month, when Mr Ozawa single-handedly--and without Mr Fujii's agreement--persuaded the prime minister to scrap a campaign promise to cut petrol taxes. But the hostilities date back further. Last year Mr Fujii led a successful campaign to stop Mr Ozawa becoming the DPJ's prime-ministerial candidate, when his office was being investigated over a political-financing scandal.

Some believe Mr Ozawa's recent assertiveness may be a shot across the prosecutors' bows.
In choosing Mr Kan as the new finance minister, Mr Hatoyama has picked a man whose relations with Mr Ozawa are considered neutral. Mr Kan was a prominent social activist before entering politics and is a former health minister. He has been in charge of developing a long-term strategy to deal with Japan's huge debt and other matters, and has been increasingly outspoken on the need to tackle deflation. His appointment is unlikely to destabilise Japan's financial markets. However, nor is it likely to dispel the impression that Mr Hatoyama is, at times, worryingly like a puppet on Mr Ozawa's string.

EVEN by its own turbulent standards, Japan Airlines (along with its long-suffering shareholders) has had a pretty wild ride in the past week and a bit. Having teetered on the brink of bankruptcy one moment, JAL seemed to have secured an improbable lifeline the next, only for its hopes to be dashed once again.
On December 30th JAL's shares plunged by 24% to their lowest point since the firm was fully privatised in 1987. News had spread that the hawks in Japan's new Democratic Party government, led by the new finance minister, Naoto Kan, had finally convinced colleagues that after three bail-outs since 2001 only ""court-backed rehabilitation"" would force JAL into the kind of radical restructuring the airline's plight demanded. But over the holiday weekend, the divided government appeared to blink: the state-owned Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) doubled its credit line to JAL to {Yen}200 billion ($2.2 billion) 
The result was a record 31% rally in JAL's shares on January 4th. The belief that the fortunes of Asia's biggest carrier might be at a turning point grew the following day when the airline announced that 68% of its employees had voted for a plan to cut future pension payments by half. But on January 6th an unsourced report in the Nikkei, Japan's leading business newspaper, suggesting that both the finance ministry and DBJ favoured pushing the airline into a prepackaged bankruptcy, sent investors scurrying for the exit again.
According to the report, DBJ, despite its willingness to provide cash to keep JAL flying, is convinced that only a court-administered process offers any hope of getting the airline's stakeholders--employees, pensioners, shareholders and creditors--to agree to the painful changes needed.
That is not what JAL's shareholders and commercial creditors want. They have been counting on the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp (ETIC), a recently-created state-backed body charged with overseeing debt-ridden firms, to sanction a further dollop of money from taxpayers. Along with JAL's management they claim that bankruptcy will not only undermine customer confidence, but also dent the prospects of ongoing negotiations to sell a stake in the airline to either Delta or American Airlines. Following last month's ""open skies"" agreement between America and Japan, both carriers are vying for JAL's hand with promises not only of cash but also of revenue growth through partnerships on international routes. 
Such arguments are unlikely to impress ETIC. It has carefully studied the experiences of American carriers, such as United Airlines and Delta itself, that emerged leaner and fitter from Chapter 11. And the government promised voters in last year's election that it would put an end to the cosy corporatism that has been both curse and blessing for JAL. 
Despite its privatisation more than 20 years ago, JAL has never really shaken off the flag-carrier mentality or the legacy costs that go with it. Throughout the past decade, the airline has swung between big losses and weak profits. In the past fiscal year, its third unprofitable year out of four, it made a net loss of {Yen}63 billion. It expects to rack up a similar loss this year. According to Heini Nuutinen, an aviation analyst, a series of attempts to restructure JAL have failed to solve its underlying problems: high labour costs, a less efficient fleet than its competitors (including All Nippon Airways (ANA), its more nimble Japanese rival), a reluctance to drop its many unprofitable routes, multiple (and militant) unions, a suffocatingly bureaucratic culture and low morale.
What JAL needs most of all is a stronger balance-sheet. At the end of September last year it had total assets of {Yen}1,683 billion against total liabilities of {Yen}1,523 billion. But according to a government-led task force appointed to come up with a viability plan for the airline, JAL now has negative net worth of as much as {Yen}800 billion. To be credible, any eventual turnaround plan will require existing shareholders to be wiped out, pension liabilities to be slashed and commercial lenders (owed at least {Yen}530 billion) to be forced to accept equity in exchange for most of their loans. All that comes on top of the 10,000 jobs and 50 routes JAL is aiming to cut in an effort to lower operating costs by 30%. 
Whether this can be achieved outside bankruptcy court is doubtful. It is also unlikely that either of the American carriers would wish to put money into JAL until its accounts look healthier. But if the airline can shed some of this weighty baggage, there is no reason why it should not prosper. Together with ANA it enjoys a near-duopoly in the third-biggest domestic market in the world. The opening of a fourth runway at Tokyo's Haneda Airport later this year is a watershed that will result in a 48% increase in slots and open up Japan's biggest domestic airport to international traffic, particularly to fast-growing Asian markets. ETIC has indicated that it will end the uncertainty about JAL's fate before the end of this month. Until it does, JAL will continue to be buffeted by rumour and counter-rumour.

RICHARD FISHER, president of the Federal Reserve's Dallas regional bank, did not hold back. Invoking the hyperinflation of Weimar Germany and Zimbabwe, he warned on January 12th that for Congress to tamper with the Fed's independence would lead ""directly to economic ruin.""
This is hyperbole, to be sure, but the threat of political meddling with independent central banks is genuine, and not just in America. This may seem unsurprising. Stressful economic times almost invariably fuel political support for inflationary policies. Yet the latest stand-offs between central banks and politicians in places as far afield as Argentina, Japan and South Korea do not yet fit this pattern. And some central banks have left themselves vulnerable because of a failure to maintain stable prices or a stable financial system. 
The most fiery clash has been in Argentina, where the president, Cristina Fernandez, tried to fire the central-bank governor, Martin Redrado, earlier this month for refusing to transfer $6.6 billion in foreign-exchange reserves to the government. Mr Redrado has refused to budge, saying that Congress has approved neither the transfer nor his dismissal.
Mr Redrado's own record is not perfect. Since the collapse of Argentina's currency board in 2002, the central bank has focused more on steadying the peso than on stabilising prices. Inflation, below 5% when Mr Redrado took office in 2004, may now be 15%. Eduardo Levy-Yeyati, a former chief economist at the central bank, says Mr Redrado could have run a tighter policy. But his task has been complicated by politically dictated changes to the consumer-price index, which puts inflation at about 7%. Mr Redrado also argues that inflation is primarily caused by loose fiscal policies. 
Ms Fernandez's tactics will only undermine the central bank's autonomy and make it harder to rein in inflation and inflation expectations. That may now require the central bank and government to agree on an inflation target and a plan of wage and price co-ordination to meet it, says Mr Levy-Yeyati.
In South Korea President Lee Myung-bak has bluntly implored the Bank of Korea to go slow in returning interest rates, now 2%, to more normal levels. To make the point more directly, the vice-minister of finance attended the bank's policy meeting on January 8th. That is the government's right, but one it had not chosen to exercise since 1999. 
By most criteria, the bank has handled itself well lately. Inflation is below the 3% midpoint of its target range and last year's economic downturn was relatively mild. The governor, Lee Seong-tae, has indicated that he wants to return rates to normal soon. The government's actions will raise questions over how steadfast the bank can remain, although it fuelled concerns itself in November by widening its inflation-target range to between 2% and 4%. The old range was 2.5-3.5%. 
In Japan deflation is the problem. Since the Democratic Party of Japan took office last year, it has been pressuring the Bank of Japan to be fiercer in fighting deflation. Despite the clumsiness of its tactics, the government's concerns are legitimate. Japan has been mired in deflation for a decade, and prices are falling by 2% year on year. 
The Bank of Japan has kept interest rates close to zero but remains otherwise oddly reluctant to take stronger action. Some outsiders believe it maintains an excessively tight policy as a way of asserting its independence, which it won at around the time deflation took hold. Its resistance, however, seems to be weakening. Shortly after Naoto Kan, then the deputy prime minister and now also the finance minister, gave a noisy warning of deflation's threat late last year, the bank adopted a new lending facility to boost the money supply and bring down money-market rates. 
In America, although the Fed enjoys the solid support of Barack Obama, it is under intensifying attack in Congress. One proposal would subject the Fed's monetary-policy decisions to congressional audit while another would make the presidents of the 12 semi-autonomous regional reserve banks politically more accountable. The Fed's inflation record is good and its response to the crisis has been creative and bold. But it has left itself open to attack by demanding more oversight of the financial system when critics say it did not make good use of its existing powers to supervise banks and enforce consumer-protection laws before the crisis. 
The latest round of meddling does not so far signal a more decisive rejection of the merits of independent central banks. Nor does a new outbreak of high inflation seem imminent, given the pervasive deflationary conditions in most of the rich world. But politicians still need to be careful. Their attacks could ultimately backfire if they undermine investor confidence and push up long-term interest rates.","From Argentina to America, politicians are taking aim

THE situation has ""completely changed,"" says an ebullient Keisuke Tsumura, an an elected official in the newish government's Cabinet Office. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) ""has redefined its understanding of price stability. Some market participants now regard it as de facto inflation-targeting.""
That would be something to get excited about. Since the start of Japan's deflationary era in 1999, the BoJ has stoutly resisted calls to set an inflation target against which it can be judged--and by which it can be embarrassed if it misses. Its inflation objective is defined in the loosest terms, as a rate between zero and 2%, with no time-frame to achieve it and no penalty for failure.
But in November Naoto Kan, who has since become Japan's finance minister, made what aides proudly call his ""deflation declaration"", urging the BoJ to redouble its efforts to combat falling prices. Days later the BoJ offered {Yen}10 trillion ($112 billion) of virtually interest-free liquidity to the banking system to fight deflation. A few weeks after that it indicated it would not tolerate an inflation rate at or below zero. Was it setting a more explicit goal? Mr Kan and his aides clearly hoped so.
The markets at first joined the celebratory mood. Foreign investors have long shunned Japanese stocks, but they sensed the possibility of a big rally if the BoJ stepped up its provision of liquidity, weakening the yen and boosting the earnings of exporters. As the yen came off its highs, investors piled into shares (see chart). But since then the yen has rebounded with barely a squeak from the BoJ. After its board met on January 26th, the bank made it clear it still sees consumer prices, excluding fresh food, falling until the end of the 2011 fiscal year (albeit at a slightly slower pace than it had predicted three months ago). Its growth projections were left largely unchanged.
So it may not be long before Mr Kan is on the warpath again. One reason is political: with upper-house elections due in July, his party, which has had a patchy start in government, badly needs economic recovery. Another reason is administrative: Mr Kan is a long-standing critic of unaccountable bureaucracies and is thought to be eager to give the BoJ a target that it can be judged by. A third reason is that fiscal constraints mean the BoJ may have to work even harder to prevent deflation and juice up the economy. A threatened ratings downgrade this week by Standard & Poor's--strangely underplayed in the national media--highlighted the frailty of Japan's public finances. 
But talk of inflation-targeting makes Mr Kan and his team look naive. The BoJ's loose, self-set goals remain. One critic dismisses it as toy inflation-targeting. ""It's like giving a schoolchild the right to choose his own homework,"" says Stephen Church of Japaninvest, a financial consultancy.","Naoto Kan wants the Bank of Japan to target inflation

After its board met on January 26th , the bank made it clear it still sees consumer prices , excluding fresh food , falling until the end of the 2011 fiscal year ( albeit at a slightly slower pace than it had predicted three months ago ) . Its growth projections were left largely unchanged . 
 So it may not be long before Naoto Kan is on the warpath again . One reason is political : with upper - house elections due in July , Naoto Kan's party , which has had a patchy start in government , badly needs economic recovery . Another reason is administrative : Naoto Kan is a long - standing critic of unaccountable bureaucracies and is thought to be eager to give the BoJ a target that it can be judged by . A third reason is that fiscal constraints mean the BoJ may have to work even harder to prevent deflation and juice up the economy . A threatened ratings downgrade this week by Standard & Poor's -- strangely underplayed in the national media -- highlighted the frailty of Japan 's public finances . 
 But talk of inflation - targeting makes Naoto Kan and Naoto Kan's team look naive . The BoJ 's loose , self - set goals remain . One critic dismisses it as toy inflation - targeting .

WHEN the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept a mildewed 55-year-old regime from power last year, nowhere epitomised the sense of energy and enthusiasm better than Nagasaki in south-western Japan. There, a bob-haired 28-year-old drove from office a grizzly 68-year-old, known as ""the Bear"", who had won nine consecutive elections for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Less than six months later, an electoral defeat in the same city has shown how quickly Yukio Hatoyama's government has dimmed those hopes. He needs to act boldly and decisively to stop his administration sinking into the very swamp of financial scandal and policy paralysis that it was elected to drain. And that requires him to rid himself of Ichiro Ozawa, the DPJ's secretary-general, electoral wizard--and, now, its biggest handicap.
This week's defeat of the DPJ's candidate for governor of Nagasaki was an indictment of Mr Hatoyama and of Mr Ozawa, both of whom have been immersed in financial scandals. The setback was compounded by the loss of a mayoral election in a quarter of Tokyo where Mr Ozawa had stooped to campaign. ""My lack of virtue is to blame,"" Mr Ozawa said afterwards, in the sort of half-baked apology that Japan has heard so often lately--not least from the boss of Toyota, the fault-prone carmaker that has added to the national malaise.
In politics grovelling is no longer enough. As Nagasaki shows, the Japanese have learned to exact summary justice at the ballot-box. If Mr Hatoyama does not make greater amends for his own and Mr Ozawa's follies, the DPJ could well pay for it in upper-house elections this July. That would leave the party's two maverick coalition partners in a strong position, which would not only damage the DPJ, but also bring further division and disillusionment to a deflation-sapped country that is crying out for good leadership.
Were this not Japan, Mr Hatoyama might have stepped down by now. To plead ignorance of the {Yen}15m ($167,000) a month with which his heiress mother had for years topped up his campaign funds looks, at best, clueless. Worse, it led to tax evasion, deliberate or not, and the indictment of a former aide. His record in power has not helped, and opinion polls suggest his popularity has collapsed. His government has squabbled with America over a marine base, and internally over fiscal stimulus and the budget. In all these fights Mr Hatoyama has come across as quirky rather than authoritative. At least prosecutors have not pressed charges over the funding scandal. Japan has endured four prime ministers between 2007 and 2009; another truncated premiership is a wearying prospect.
Mr Hatoyama's minimum act of contrition should be ensuring that Mr Ozawa steps down as the DPJ's secretary-general. Prosecutors may have found nothing to pin on Mr Ozawa, but three current or former aides have been indicted for the misuse of political funds, and the influence he exerts over Mr Hatoyama and the ruling party is unhealthy.
Mr Ozawa may have helped win the DPJ's thumping majority in last August's lower-house contest. But since then, he has thrown his weight around over cabinet appointments, budgetary matters and affairs of state (he recently demanded to meet Barack Obama on a forthcoming visit to Washington). His swagger risks dividing the party, and he has become an electoral liability. He is probably shrewd enough to realise this; most opinion polls indicate he should go. But the longer he takes, the more disenchanted voters are likely to become. The Seven Samurai to the rescue?
Mr Hatoyama will have to find salvation elsewhere in his party--and thankfully there is some hope of this. Some ministers are learning quickly on the job. For instance, Naoto Kan, the new finance minister, has called for debate on raising the consumption tax. That is no vote-winner, but it is vital for sorting out Japan's precarious public finances. Other cabinet members distant from Mr Ozawa--some call them the ""Seven Samurai""--appear refreshingly eager to get on with making policy, rather than playing politics. 
Mr Hatoyama should take a bold gamble and turn to these people to revive his party's chances in July. Even if he jettisons Mr Ozawa, the chances are that he will rely on the man's Svengali-like influence from behind the scenes. For the good of Japan he should not. He needs to show that his party can coalesce around principles and policies, not just power. Rarely in the past half-century has Japan managed that. Mr Hatoyama has an historic opportunity to try.

Countries compete to weaken their currencies
ONCE upon a time, nations took pride in their strong currencies, seeing them as symbols of economic and political power. Nowadays it seems as if the foreign-exchange markets are home to a bunch of Charles Atlas's 97-pound weaklings, all of them eager to have sand kicked in their faces.
First the dollar took a battering in 2009 when the return of risk appetite, and the ability to borrow the currency at very low rates, sent money flowing out of America for use in speculative ""carry trade"" transactions. Then the euro got pummelled because of concerns about the euro zone's exposure to sovereign-debt problems in southern Europe. Finally sterling hit the canvas this week because of concerns about the British government's deficit and the policy gridlock that may result from a hung parliament after a general election expected in May.
Is there any sign that politicians and central bankers are upset by these depreciations? None at all. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, seems to welcome sterling's weakness as a boost to exporters. European politicians, such as Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, have revealed their pleasure at the euro's recent decline for similar reasons. The American authorities, while parroting their belief in a strong dollar, have done nothing to shore it up, neither raising interest rates nor cutting the fiscal deficit nor intervening in the markets. 
Nor has there been much sign of rejoicing in those countries whose currencies have tended to strengthen. The Swiss have intervened to hold down the franc. And Japan's latest finance minister, Naoto Kan, has called for a weaker yen (although he received a rebuke from the prime minister for doing so). 
The one country that most economists agree should let its currency rise is China (in theory, faster-growing countries should enjoy real appreciation over the long term). But the People's Republic also resists the temptation, intervening to stop the yuan from rising against the dollar.
Why are weak currencies so much in favour these days? The answer seems to be that the interests of exporters are paramount, given the desperate scramble for growth that has followed the credit crunch and the global recession. 
Of course, because currencies cannot depreciate all at once, there seems to be a kind of ""Buggins' turn"" to be the land of the rising exchange rate. The starring role tends to be brief, either because the government takes action to weaken the currency, or because economic news prompts the markets to drive it down. 
At the same time weaker currencies have not been punished in the traditional way--by higher inflation. Consider sterling. Using the currency's 2007 peaks as a guide, the pound has fallen more sharply against the dollar and euro (around 25-30%) than it did after the exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992.
In the 1970s that kind of depreciation was accompanied by double-digit inflation. But the year-on-year increase in the British retail-price index was just 3.5% in January and even that number was pushed up by higher rates of value-added tax, a home-grown factor. Nor is Britain paying any great price for losing its European and American creditors more than a quarter of their money in three years. Short-term rates are just 0.5% and ten-year government bonds yield a lowish 4%.
To some, the lesson of all this is clear. If all the issuers of paper money want to see their currencies depreciate, then the only answer is to own an asset that central banks cannot debase--namely, gold. Part of bullion's rise to more than $1,100 an ounce this year must be attributed to the conviction that governments will inflate away their debts.
But it is hard to see how sustained rises in inflation will be generated in the next couple of years, given the amount of spare capacity in the global economy. It is also far from certain that governments could get away with a deliberate strategy of higher inflation, given the generally short maturity of their debts (less than five years, in America's case). The markets would see them coming and increase bond yields accordingly.
Indeed the current sovereign-debt jitters may be a sign that creditors are starting to assert themselves again, and demanding higher yields from less prudent governments. Where countries depend on foreigners to fund their deficits, they may find that the ""easy"" option of depreciation carries a much higher cost than in recent years. In time, having a strong currency may once again come to be seen as an advantage, not a handicap.","Economist.com/blogs/buttonwood

THE survival instincts of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have long been extraordinary. Born early in the cold war, it was still clinging to power almost 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Though neither particularly liberal nor especially democratic, nor even (by Western standards) much like a real party, the LDP still once hoped to rule Japan for ""half an eternity"". Yet this week it lurched closer to extinction after senior figures walked out to form a new political group.
Compared with the LDP's overwhelming electoral defeat last year, the departure of Kaoru Yosano, a 71-year-old former finance minister, and at least two other party veterans might be an historical footnote. But it reflects a growing fragmentation of Japan's political landscape in advance of upper-house elections in July. This poses a threat not just to the LDP but to the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
The Stand Up, Japan party--to be formed by Mr Yosano, and another former LDP minister, Takeo Hiranuma--is unlikely to represent a progressive force. Mr Yosano is a fiscal conservative, Mr Hiranuma a hard-line right-winger. The party appears to have the blessing of some of the Jurassic elements of Japan's establishment, such as Shintaro Ishihara, governor of Tokyo, and Tsuneo Watanabe, 84-year-old head of the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. 
Its formation, however, comes at a moment when, for the first time, opinion polls show that more than half of voters reject the dpj as well as the ldp. That could benefit Japan's array of upstarts--and one of them in particular, the pro-free-market Your Party, which is edging up in the opinion polls. By setting up to the right of others, Stand Up, Japan may be hoping to draw right-wingers away from both main parties. For the DPJ government that is troubling because its own poll support has slumped as a result of indecisiveness and funding scandals involving Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, and Ichiro Ozawa, the party's influential secretary-general. Until recently, the party's only consolation was that its rival, the LDP, was even less popular. 
Within the DPJ, despair at Messrs Hatoyama and Ozawa is growing. On April 7th Kozo Watanabe, an influential DPJ rebel, went so far as to suggest that Mr Hatoyama's cabinet should resign en masse if it fails by next month to resolve a fractious issue concerning the relocation of an American marine base in Okinawa, an island in southern Japan.
A day earlier, Yosuke Kondo, a deputy minister in Mr Hatoyama's government, said that 80% of the DPJ think Mr Ozawa should leave his post, and that kicking him out would be a good way for Mr Hatoyama to show leadership. However, he acknowledged there was a risk that a disgruntled Mr Ozawa could team up with Mr Yosano and take some of the party with him. He said Naoto Kan, the finance minister, had recently warned party members of the dangers of turning Mr Ozawa into an opponent. ""You have to keep him in the birdcage,"" as Mr Kan supposedly put it.
The DPJ is traumatised by fear of internal strife. The previous time the LDP lost power in 1993, the government that took over--which includes many of today's DPJ stalwarts--promptly tore itself apart through internal wrangling, much of it orchestrated by Mr Ozawa. The LDP was back in charge 11 months later.
What is more, before it took power the DPJ lambasted the LDP for changing a string of prime ministers without holding a general election. ""Hardly anyone in the party wants to remove Hatoyama-san from the leadership before he finishes his four-year term,"" Mr Kondo says. A revolving door of prime ministers, ""damages people's trust."" 
If the polls are right, however, trust is dwindling anyway. Unless the party can restore its lustre before the upper-house elections, say political analysts, the DPJ may be forced to rely on scrappy coalition partners.
If it does badly in those elections, it may find it easier to jettison Mr Ozawa, as the architect of the poor performance, and perhaps get rid of Mr Hatoyama, too. But as Japanese politics fragment, the party may no longer be able to count on an anti-LDP vote. The most powerful message from last August's election was not of people's loyalty to the DPJ, though it won overwhelmingly. It was that voters, after five decades of one-party rule, suddenly grasped that they have the power to change politics. The DPJ is now realising, to its alarm, that that change cuts both ways.","Party divisions suggest Japan 's political transformation has a long way to go

IF CHINA is the workshop of the world, Japan is the pristine, state-of-the-art laboratory in its backyard. You can see that by the sort of products shipped through the East China Sea in ever-greater quantities from Japan ever since China led a recovery in world trade last year. Forget the digital cameras and other high-tech gadgets. Japanese exports to China are reviving mainly on the back of products that seem to have all the sex appeal of gravel: plastic materials (up 105%, year on year, in January and February), non-metallic mineral goods (up 113%), construction machines (up 152%), textile machines (up 171%), vehicle parts (up 144%) and scientific instruments (up 133%).
Despite appearances, these are all high-tech products or high-value industrial ingredients that feed into a supply chain that snakes through the factories of East Asia to the rest of the world. With public money in China pushing growth there to a brisk canter, and inventories all over the world being restocked, it was only a matter of time before Japan's exporters began to benefit.
The strength of the recovery has surprised many economists. Japan was one of the hardest-hit countries during the global financial crisis. The collapse in exports helped put a nail in the coffin of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had ruled Japan for most of the past 55 years, partly on the strength of its ties with Japan's globe-trotting corporate giants. It was swept from power last September by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which promised to end the economy's dependence on fickle exports and promote a more balanced economy.
Fickleness cuts both ways, however. Japan's recession hit bottom in the first three months of 2009. JPMorgan calculates that over the subsequent nine months the export revival led to annualised growth of 3.1%, outstripping both America and the euro zone. Corporate profits enjoyed their biggest surge on record, albeit from very depressed levels. Unemployment has edged downwards and in January this year monthly wages crept higher compared with a year earlier for the first time in more than 18 months. JPMorgan recently upgraded its forecast for first-quarter GDP growth from 1.8% to 3.5%.
Last year's rebound in GDP, JPMorgan notes, was only a quarter of what Japan lost in the first 12 months of the crisis, so it still has a long way to go. Unless growth in global demand is sustained, it remains heavily reliant on pump-priming, both in China and at home. The recovery is likely to be given an extra fillip this year by the 2010 budget, passed on March 24th, which includes handouts to families with children under 16. In principle, spurring domestic consumption by any means available is the right thing for the seven-month-old government to do, given the fragility of the rebound. But given Japan's precarious public finances, a bigger question is: can the recovery be sustained?
The answer, disappointingly, is not for very long. That is because the cyclical upturn is unlikely to do any more than paper over Japan's deep-seated problems. These include deflation, huge public debt, ugly demographics and a glaring lack of decisiveness among policymakers about how to deal with them. Unless things change radically, these problems seem destined to sap nominal growth for years to come, with possibly disastrous consequences. Deeply depressing
To start with, Japan's economy continues to operate far below capacity. The output gap stands at 7%, three times bigger than it has been at any time since Japan's asset-price bubble burst 20 years ago, according to Richard Katz of the Oriental Economist, a newsletter. The gap between actual GDP and potential GDP (when the economy is at full throttle) correlates well with deflation, he argues (see chart 1 on next page). That suggests consumer prices have further to fall. In its latest estimate the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the credibility of which should rest on ending deflation, predicted that consumer prices would continue to fall until March 2012.
Falling prices mean that nominal GDP, which last year hit its lowest level since 1991, is likely to remain in the deep freeze. That will add to pressure on the public purse: in the 2010 budget, borrowing, at {Yen}44 trillion ($468 billion), is for the first time forecast to exceed tax revenues, at {Yen}37 trillion. It also means the gross debt-to-GDP ratio, already the highest in the rich world at 190%, will continue to rise.
Some argue that this combination of deflation-sapped growth and high debt makes Japan next in line for a Greek-style debt crisis. In a report last month, Goldman Sachs said some foreign investors were positioning themselves for a ""meltdown"". They were buying options to prepare for two related events: a sharp rise in long-term interest rates because of an erosion in debt sustainability, and a slump in the yen caused by capital flight from Japan.
One senior bureaucrat in the finance ministry returned from a G7 meeting in Canada in February, his ears ringing with worries about Greece--and, by extension, Japan. But he appeared to find it more wearying than alarming. ""For years we have been hearing warnings that Japanese-government bonds are going to collapse. It's like the doomsday view of the dollar,"" he moaned. Pointing to a trading screen on the wall where ten-year Japanese bond yields were yielding a meagre 1.4%, he noted that the market was still holding firm (in Greece, yields were about 7% at the time). He believes that Japan still has plenty of room to avoid a fiscal implosion.
In the short term, there are grounds for sharing his confidence. In many sovereign-debt crises, the trigger is not the level of debt, but the government's inability to finance it. In a recent IMF working paper*, Kiichi Tokuoka notes that in recent years there has been scant linkage between Japanese government-bond yields and the size of Japan's debt and deficits. Indeed, when net debt was less than 20% of GDP in the early 1990s, ten-year bonds yielded 7%. As the debt has soared, yields have moved in the opposite direction (see chart 2).
There are many Japan-specific reasons for this, he argues. The Japanese have a large, albeit now scarcely growing, store of savings that have helped finance the build-up of debt. At the end of 2008 domestic investors held 94% of Japanese government bonds, perhaps reflecting the risk-averse nature of Japanese society. More than half of the country's {Yen}1,400 trillion of financial assets is held in cash and deposits (in America the figure is 14%), and a large part of these are invested in Japanese government bonds via the banking system. Big public institutions such as the Japan Post Bank hold lots of government bonds. So do Japanese firms, many of which have large financial surpluses after a long period of post-bubble deleveraging.
There may be other factors at play, too. Even with nominal interest rates so low, deflation has given investors a pretty good risk-adjusted return. Why diversify? Other assets, such as land and shares, remain at paltry levels compared with their bubble-era peaks. Investing abroad has been hobbled by the yen's strength. Japanese government bonds, by contrast, have enjoyed one of the biggest bull runs in history. Some even suggest, with a conspiratorial wink, that one reason the authorities have done so little to tackle deflation is that they fear the consequences in the bond market if consumer prices were to accelerate. Crisis? What crisis?
Paradoxically, however, the belief that there is no imminent crisis brewing may be Japan's biggest problem. Without it, there may be nothing to force Japan's policymakers out of a deep paralysis. The scale of the institutional lethargy in Japan is at times breathtaking. Everyone, it seems, puts the blame for deflation and rising debt elsewhere.
Take deflation, for instance. By any reckoning it has had a corrosive effect on consumption, debt and investment in the past decade. And expectations of further deflation are entrenched: more than 35% of people expect prices to be flat or lower in five years' time. The finance ministry, led by Naoto Kan, a newish finance minister, argues with increasing stridency that it is necessary for the BoJ to root out deflation, so that Japan can once again resume nominal GDP growth. Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, has collared Masaaki Shirakawa, the BoJ's governor, on the issue.
Yet because the annual decline in consumer prices has been only moderate-- they have never fallen by more than 1.4%, in contrast with the rapidly plunging prices of America's Depression in the 1930s--the central bank tends to view deflation as insidious, rather than cataclysmic. As one insider rather nonchalantly puts it, it is a symptom of bigger underlying problems, rather than the problem itself.
The bank thinks the real problems are low productivity growth in Japan, which keeps wages low and suppresses demand for goods and services, and high public debt. In that sense, bizarrely for a central bank, it does not appear to believe that deflation is a monetary problem. Its own earlier experience of monetary stimulus since 1995, when it more than doubled the monetary base with little discernible effect on nominal growth, has left it unimpressed. As a result, it injected liquidity only half-heartedly into the system during the global financial crisis, putting it at odds with central banks in other rich countries.
The BoJ's resistance to acting more forcefully may be rooted in its own analysis of its earlier experience. It also seems to be haunted by the potential consequences for its credibility if it acts and fails. That position might be understandable if it were a clearly stated policy. But the bank seems to want it both ways. After much government pressure, in March it said it would extend its emergency supply of three-month loans to the banking system by {Yen}10 trillion. But far from being seen as a principled move to jump-start lending, this was perceived as a weak attempt by the bank to get the government off its back--and the BoJ's credibility took a further knock.
When it comes to public debt, the finance ministry's ostrich-like argument that there is little it can do about it until the BoJ deals with deflation is just as frustrating. It, too, appears to think that things are not as bad as the outside world believes. As one central banker ruefully puts it: ""Japan is not faced with an imminent debt crisis. But that is a mixed blessing.""
The torpor dates back years. The finance ministry is haunted by its premature attempt to raise consumption taxes before a recovery was fully under way in 1997. Another attempt to overhaul spending and taxation was launched in 2006, not long before the bursting of the global credit bubble brought it to a halt. According to the OECD, under previous LDP governments, much of the emphasis on improving public finances was focused on spending cuts rather than tax increases. Taxation as a share of GDP remains among the lowest in the OECD. But the tax system is hardly conducive to growth, with some of the highest corporate-tax rates and lowest consumption-tax rates in the rich world. To bureaucrats in the finance ministry, this suggests there is plenty of fiscal flexibility in Japan to deal with the debt problem. The trouble is they have never succeeded at tax reform.
Into this policy vacuum came the new DPJ government last year, with Mr Hatoyama vowing that he would not consider raising the consumption tax until the next elections in 2013. Greece's fiscal mess may have knocked a greater sense of urgency into his administration. After his first G7 meeting in February, Mr Kan, the newly appointed finance minister, began to speak more publicly of fiscal reform.
Others have taken up his call. Yoshito Sengoku, Mr Kan's replacement as strategy minister, says that the moment borrowing exceeded tax revenues in the 2010 budget, it was clear that Japan had reached a turning point. ""I don't think the situation will go immediately as it did in Greece. But going forward the Japanese bond market will always be under pressure and the government officials who are in charge of fiscal policies have to be ten times more cautious than before,"" he says.
He favours an increase in the consumption tax and may also support cuts in corporate tax when he announces a medium-term plan for fiscal reform in the spring. But the politics of a significant overhaul are excruciatingly complicated. After a series of political-funding scandals involving Mr Hatoyama, support for his administration has fallen sharply ahead of upper- house elections in the summer. So it is a safe bet that any talk of tax reform will be accompanied by soothing promises of higher welfare spending. We can't go on like this
At present none of the ideas being aired to deal with Japan's problems is anything like bold or concrete enough to sound convincing. And though the government may muddle through for a few years yet, ultimately the situation is unsustainable. At some point, unless radical steps are taken, Japan's government will go bust.
The IMF's Mr Tokuoka reckons that as the population ages, savings will dwindle, which could reduce inflows to the government-bond market. He calculates that even if the household savings rate remains at 2.2%, by 2015 gross public debt could exceed households' financial assets, which might make domestic funding more difficult and lead Japan to rely more on foreigners. Meanwhile, government pension funds have more flexibility to invest in other assets besides government bonds.
With interest payments at 26% of tax revenues, rising yields would come as a huge shock to Japan. Already, some economists argue that flat bond yields give only the illusion of market stability. Ryutaro Kono, chief economist of BNP Paribas in Japan, says that given the fall in Japan's potential growth rate and the drop in inflation expectations, yields should normally have plunged. ""The fact that the long-term rate has generally been flat for the last 18 months suggests the risk premium is rising on questions of the sustainability of Japan's public debt,"" he says.
What's more, rising social-security payments as the population ages are likely to put even more pressure on public financing, while the shrinking workforce will mean even slower growth and smaller tax revenues. In 1990 almost six people of working age supported each retiree. By 2025 the Japanese government expects that ratio to fall to two. At some point Japan may have no other option than a domestic default in which the older generation, who hold most of the government bonds, will see the value of their investments cut to reduce the pressure on the younger generation. Such an intergenerational transfer would come at enormous political and social cost, not least in a society with such a strong sense of communal well-being.
Economists suggest many schemes to forestall such a crisis, most of which involve the government and the BoJ producing what the Oriental Economist's Mr Katz calls a ""fiscal-monetary one-two punch"" to kick-start nominal growth. Massive and well-targeted fiscal stimulus is one option, he writes: the current ""eco-points"" subsidy scheme, which has led to a surge in purchases of energy-saving durable goods, is a good example. In return, the BoJ should commit to keeping long-term rates low by increasing its purchases of government bonds. Others favour a sharp cut in corporate tax rates to boost competitiveness.
Many observers agree that fiscal looseness is the best first step to faster nominal GDP growth. Jesper Koll, a strategist at Merrill Lynch, plausibly argues, however, that raising the consumption tax in small increments each year might encourage people to accelerate their spending plans. Whatever their prescriptions, few are optimistic. As Mr Katz puts it: ""To reject both fiscal and monetary tools is to say that Japan can only wait for the rest of the world to rescue it. That's the passive mindset that has kept Japan stagnant for two decades so far.""
One of the biggest challenges in stimulating growth is to persuade households and firms to borrow again. Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute calls their reluctance to do so the ""debt-rejection syndrome"". Having finally paid off their bubble-era bills, many are likely to have a visceral objection to borrowing. He thinks an investment-tax credit for firms, and a promotion of investment by homeowners in Japan's feeble housing stock, would help.
Macroeconomic medicine, though essential, will not be enough to solve Japan's problems. Structural reforms to raise the economy's efficiency will be needed too. The list of areas which need a shake-up is as long as it is familiar. The heavily mollycoddled agricultural sector needs deregulating, and services from transport to power generation need to be opened up to foreign competition. Allowing more immigrants would boost the labour force. Many of these proposals are a hard sell culturally. But if the perils of inaction were well laid out, it would not be the first time Japanese citizens have been asked to accept big sacrifices in the national interest.
The trouble is, there is little tangible sense, either among politicians or in the country at large, that a crisis is brewing. And if the economy continues its cyclical improvement, the urgency of reform may appear even less compelling. It will be even harder given people's abiding faith, Toyota's humiliating recalls notwithstanding, in the prowess of Japan's cutting-edge exporters and their growing links with China. As one businessman puts it, in a country that has been blighted by wars, fires and earthquakes throughout its history, people have grown accustomed to waiting until disaster is actually upon them before they focus on renewal.
A lot about this state of affairs--particularly the reluctance to do anything radical--is profoundly Japanese. It may mean the country is consigned to stagnation, which only makes an eventual default appear more inevitable. But the lessons from Japan are important for all countries, such as America, Britain and parts of Europe, that have suffered a big asset bust. It shows that in the aftermath of a meltdown, slow growth, low productivity, rising public debt and deflationary pressures can last a lot longer than anyone thinks--and that policymakers can make all sorts of mistakes as they try to escape them.
* ""The Outlook for Financing Japan's Public Debt"" by Kiichi Tokuoka, IMF
Caption: Intergenerational transfer; Intergenerational transfer","Japan 's government will eventually have a disaster on its hands if it fails to tackle the deep - seated problems of debt and deflation 
 IF CHINA is the workshop of the world , Japan is the pristine , state - of - the - art laboratory in its backyard . You can see that by the sort of products shipped through the East China Sea in ever - greater quantities from Japan ever since China led a recovery in world trade last year . Forget the digital cameras and other high - tech gadgets . Japanese exports to China are reviving mainly on the back of products that seem to have all the sex appeal of gravel : plastic materials ( up 105 % , year on year , in January and February ) , non - metallic mineral goods ( up 113 % ) , construction machines ( up 152 % ) , textile machines ( up 171 % ) , vehicle parts ( up 144 % ) and scientific instruments ( up 133 % ) . 
 Despite appearances , these are all high - tech products or high - value industrial ingredients that feed into a supply chain that snakes through the factories of East Asia to the rest of the world . With public money in China pushing growth there to a brisk canter , and inventories all over the world being restocked , it was only a matter of time before Japan 's exporters began to benefit . 
 The strength of the recovery has surprised many economists . Japan was one of the hardest - hit countries during the global financial crisis . The collapse in exports helped put a nail in the coffin of the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which had ruled Japan for most of the past 55 years , partly on the strength of its ties with Japan 's globe - trotting corporate giants . It was swept from power last September by the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , which promised to end the economy 's dependence on fickle exports and promote a more balanced economy . 
 Fickleness cuts both ways , however . Japan 's recession hit bottom in the first three months of 2009 . JPMorgan calculates that over the subsequent nine months the export revival led to annualised growth of 3.1 % , outstripping both America and the euro zone . Corporate profits enjoyed their biggest surge on record , albeit from very depressed levels . Unemployment has edged downwards and in January this year monthly wages crept higher compared with a year earlier for the first time in more than 18 months . JPMorgan recently upgraded its forecast for first - quarter GDP growth from 1.8 % to 3.5 % . 
 Last year 's rebound in GDP , JPMorgan notes , was only a quarter of what Japan lost in the first 12 months of the crisis , so it still has a long way to go . Unless growth in global demand is sustained , it remains heavily reliant on pump - priming , both in China and at home . The recovery is likely to be given an extra fillip this year by the 2010 budget , passed on March 24th , which includes handouts to families with children under 16 . In principle , spurring domestic consumption by any means available is the right thing for the seven - month - old government to do , given the fragility of the rebound . But given Japan 's precarious public finances , a bigger question is : can the recovery be sustained ? 
 The answer , disappointingly , is not for very long . That is because the cyclical upturn is unlikely to do any more than paper over Japan 's deep - seated problems . These include deflation , huge public debt , ugly demographics and a glaring lack of decisiveness among policymakers about how to deal with them . Unless things change radically , these problems seem destined to sap nominal growth for years to come , with possibly disastrous consequences . Deeply depressing 
 To start with , Japan 's economy continues to operate far below capacity . The output gap stands at 7 % , three times bigger than it has been at any time since Japan 's asset - price bubble burst 20 years ago , according to Richard Katz of the Oriental Economist , a newsletter . The gap between actual GDP and potential GDP ( when the economy is at full throttle ) correlates well with deflation , he argues ( see chart 1 on next page ) . That suggests consumer prices have further to fall . In its latest estimate the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) , the credibility of which should rest on ending deflation , predicted that consumer prices would continue to fall until March 2012 .

2010-06-05,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/365408753/fulltext/37888BA7E36043F2PQ/14?accountid=14657,"It used to be the envy of the world; now the hope is that things have got so bad that reform is finally possible
SINCE 2006 Japan has had no fewer than five prime ministers. Three of them lasted just a year. The feckless Yukio Hatoyama, who stepped down on June 2nd, managed a grand total of 259 days. Particularly dispiriting about Mr Hatoyama's sudden departure is that his election last August looked as if it marked the start of something new in Japanese politics after decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). His government has turned out to be as incompetent, aimless and tainted by scandal as its predecessors. 
Much of the responsibility for the mess belongs with Mr Hatoyama. The man known as ""the alien"", who says the sight of a little bird last weekend gave him the idea to resign, has shown breathtaking lack of leadership. Although support for his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has slumped in opinion polls and the government relied on minor parties, the most glaring liabilities have been over Mr Hatoyama's own murky financial affairs and his dithering about where to put an American military base. The question for the next prime minister, to be picked in a DPJ vote on June 4th, is whether Mr Hatoyama's failure means that Japan's nine-month experiment with two-party democracy has been a misconceived disaster.
The answer is of interest not just within Japan. Such is the recent merry-go-round of prime ministers that it is easy to assume that whoever runs the show makes no difference to the performance of the world's second-largest economy. Now Japan's prominence in Asia has so clearly been eclipsed by China, its flimsy politicians are all the easier to dismiss.
But that dangerously underestimates Japan's importance to the world and the troubles it faces. With the largest amount of debt relative to the size of its economy among the rich countries, and a stubborn deflation problem to boot, Japan has an economic time-bomb ticking beneath it. It may be able to service its debt comfortably for the time being, but the euro zone serves as a reminder that Japan needs strong leadership to stop the bomb from exploding.
What's more, stability around South and East Asia depends to a large extent on Japan's 50-year-old security alliance with America, which acts as a counterbalance against Chinese military expansion. The nine-month stand-off between Japan and America over a marine base in Okinawa, a fight which Mr Hatoyama picked himself and has now done for him, is a glaring example of how poor leadership can muddy the waters. Shogun to Japan's head
With Mr Hatoyama out of the way, it is tempting to hope that the DPJ will put its problems behind it and quickly rebuild its credibility with the electorate and Japan's friends abroad. There are two reasons for misgivings, however. The first is the role of Ichiro Ozawa, the Svengali-like figure who stood mischievously behind Mr Hatoyama. The second is the calibre of the candidates to become Japan's next prime minister.
Mr Ozawa resigned as the DPJ's secretary-general alongside Mr Hatoyama, but he, unlike his boss, has not promised to bow out of politics. Moreover, he has such influence over the party that he could continue to pull strings from behind the scenes, especially ahead of upper-house elections this summer. That would be inexcusable. Like Mr Hatoyama, Mr Ozawa has been caught up in campaign-funding scandals that have reeked as badly as they ever did under the LDP. He has meddled with good policies and failed to stop bad ones, such as the attempt to roll back the privatisation of the postal system. The ""Shadow Shogun"" represents the worst side of the old politics. If Mr Ozawa remains influential, he will only undermine any future party leader in the eyes of voters.
Whoever that leader is will have plenty to prove as it is (see
). As The Economist went to press, the most likely replacement for Mr Hatoyama was Naoto Kan, the finance minister. He has shown more financial nous than Messrs Hatoyama and Ozawa in arguing for fiscal reform in Japan. But he has kept so quiet about the DPJ's failing leadership that it is hard to imagine him putting Mr Ozawa in his place. Other potential candidates, who have stood up more firmly to Mr Ozawa, will be opposed by many in the party who are under the man's sway. And sadly, none looks like he has enough of the right stuff to restore Japan's standing in the world. Look up, Japan
For many voters, this all smacks of Japan's earlier attempt to escape the LDP's shadow, in 1993. The coalition government that replaced it--also under Mr Ozawa's spell--lasted barely 11 months. But a lot has changed since then. Today the LDP has only slightly benefited from the DPJ's woes, and is itself in danger of splintering. The legacy of two lost decades has left voters with little nostalgia for old habits. Having finally broken the mould of Japanese politics, it is almost inconceivable that they will vote the old lot back into office. 
However far-fetched it seems at this sorry juncture, Japan's leadership crisis presents a chance to progress to a new sort of politics, based more around policies than personalities. Besides its fiscal problems, Japan has an ageing population that will be a draw on the public purse. Its stock of savings is diminishing, and though it is riddled with misgivings about the presence of American troops in Japan so long after the second world war, it can hardly pay for its own defence. Factional politics has failed utterly to deal with these problems. But divisions within the political duopoly have produced splinter parties, some of which have sensible ideas for putting Japan's economy back on track. The new DPJ leadership, however badly it does in this summer's upper-house elections, should capitalise on that by forming coalitions with its ideological peers, rather than with the mavericks it has relied on so far. Getting rid of Mr Ozawa would be a sign of real change. 
There is hope therefore that things are beginning to get so bad that reform really will appear relatively soon. But the main impression at the moment is of drift. The sad fact is that the world's second biggest economy, home to companies that have changed industries around the world, is being kept out of dire trouble only by the loyalty of its own savers.","It used to be the envy of the world ; now the hope is that things have got so bad that reform is finally possible 
 SINCE 2006 Japan has had no fewer than five prime ministers . Three of them lasted just a year . The feckless Yukio Hatoyama , who stepped down on June 2nd , managed a grand total of 259 days . Particularly dispiriting about Mr Hatoyama 's sudden departure is that his election last August looked as if it marked the start of something new in Japanese politics after decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . His government has turned out to be as incompetent , aimless and tainted by scandal as its predecessors . 
 Much of the responsibility for the mess belongs with Mr Hatoyama . The man known as "" the alien "" , who says the sight of a little bird last weekend gave him the idea to resign , has shown breathtaking lack of leadership . Although support for his Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) has slumped in opinion polls and the government relied on minor parties , the most glaring liabilities have been over Mr Hatoyama 's own murky financial affairs and his dithering about where to put an American military base . The question for the next prime minister , to be picked in a DPJ vote on June 4th , is whether Mr Hatoyama 's failure means that Japan 's nine - month experiment with two - party democracy has been a misconceived disaster . 
 The answer is of interest not just within Japan . Such is the recent merry - go - round of prime ministers that it is easy to assume that whoever runs the show makes no difference to the performance of the world 's second - largest economy . Now Japan 's prominence in Asia has so clearly been eclipsed by China , its flimsy politicians are all the easier to dismiss . 
 But that dangerously underestimates Japan 's importance to the world and the troubles it faces . With the largest amount of debt relative to the size of its economy among the rich countries , and a stubborn deflation problem to boot , Japan has an economic time - bomb ticking beneath it . It may be able to service its debt comfortably for the time being , but the euro zone serves as a reminder that Japan needs strong leadership to stop the bomb from exploding .

JUST before Yukio Hatoyama stepped down as Japan's prime minister on June 2nd, he carried out what could--in an ideal world--be one of the bolder acts of his premiership. He convinced Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-general of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and a powerbroker who has held sway over Japan's mildewed politics for decades, to resign with him.
After announcing his decision, Mr Hatoyama, who is only 63, promised to retire gracefully from politics. His eyes wet with tears, he showed what appeared to be genuine contrition for letting down voters who nine months ago overwhelmingly backed his party in a general election, ending more than half a century of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Not so Mr Ozawa. As The Economist went to press, there was still some doubt that his resignation would loosen his grip on the party machine. He currently commands the loyalty of at least 150 ruling-party lawmakers, by far the biggest faction in the parliament, or Diet. That would give him some influence over whomever the party picks to replace Mr Hatoyama at a gathering on June 4th, even from behind the scenes. 
The front-runner for the job has long been Naoto Kan, the finance minister and deputy prime minister (see box on next page). Before the vote he received a fillip when two possible rivals, the foreign and transport ministers, decided not to run against him. But whoever the new leader is, he--it is never a she--will have a lot on his plate. After picking a cabinet, he will have less than a fortnight before the session of the Diet ends on June 16th. That means he will have to decide whether to postpone or scrap a controversial bill to reverse the reform of the postal system. Scrapping it would anger a small coalition partner of the DPJ that is passionately opposed to privatisation. It would also alienate the politically powerful postal workers. But it would be a strong signal to financial markets that the new leader has his economic priorities right.
Then, on July 11th, come mid-term elections for the upper house. These will be another milestone for the DPJ. Months ago, gaining a majority in the upper house to add to its lower-house one was considered a safe bet. But the DPJ's financial scandals, and Mr Hatoyama's inability to decide until last month what to do about an American marine base in Okinawa, have hit the party hard, according to opinion surveys. The new leader will have his work cut out to avoid a drubbing at the polls.
What is more, he must somehow escape the curse of Okinawa. Friction with America over relocating the marine base there ultimately triggered Mr Hatoyama's downfall. The hope for Mr Kan, if he is the new leader, will be that his silence on the issue during the past nine months will absolve him of responsibility for it. He could maintain an existing agreement with America, which would mollify the administration, and hope that the anger in Okinawa is eventually forgotten by much of the electorate. The Okinawans, however, will do their best to keep their strident opposition to the base in the public eye.
Even if the DPJ's popularity is not significantly enhanced by the change of leader, a poor showing in the upper-house election could be a blessing in disguise. It would reinforce the impression that Mr Ozawa had done the party no good, and make it easier to send him packing. 
Within the Diet, some small parties are winning popularity at the expense of the flailing DPJ and the discredited LDP. Some, such as Your Party, have sensibly liberal views, and might be willing to align with the DPJ, provided Mr Ozawa were not lurking in the shadows. Mr Ozawa's resignation ""opens up the possibility of a coalition as long as [Mr] Ozawa doesn't try to run the DPJ through a surrogate,"" writes Richard Katz of the Oriental Economist, a newsletter (unrelated to The Economist).
Coalition politics can be scrappy. Mr Hatoyama's feisty partners made life tough for him over the Okinawa air base. Without a big majority, a dominant party like the DPJ can easily get bogged down in parliament. Japan could become even more directionless than it already is.
But coalitions have merits, sometimes forcing bigger parties to accommodate smaller ones to get their policies voted into law. If policies in Japan become more important than personalities, it would mark a welcome shift. Even if this new style of politics weakens big parties, that could be no bad thing, considering how chaotic recent years have been under them.","And a new generation of leaders beckons .

IN A country where only one prime minister has lasted more than three years in the past 20 (the uncharacteristicly charismatic Junichiro Koizumi), people are understandably blase about who will be the next man in the top job. This time could be different. If the leader can step out from under the shadow of Japan's last old-fashioned factional boss, the Democratic Party of Japan's Ichiro Ozawa, he could usher in a new sort of coalition politics, with the potential to be either disastrously messy or refreshingly clean.
The most likely successor has long been Naoto Kan, the 63-year-old finance minister and deputy prime minister. His pedigree would mark a change to the top in itself. Since Mr Koizumi resigned in 2006, Japan has had five prime ministers, all of whom have been either the son or grandson of a former prime minister. Of unflashy origin, the dogged Mr Kan made his own way up the political ladder, gaining prestige in the mid-1990s when, as health minister, he exposed bureaucrats who allowed the transfusion of HIV-tainted blood to haemophiliacs.
He had little macroeconomic experience before being appointed finance minister in January, but gained a reputation among the ministry's bureaucrats as a quick learner. They were thrilled that he actually listened to them. In that job, he has stood out for two reasons: his willingness to begin discussing--albeit gingerly--a rise in the consumption tax as part of a fiscal overhaul to reduce Japan's crushing debt burden; and justifiable criticism of the Bank of Japan for not doing enough to end deflation.
But he has one big flaw. While in the cabinet, he made no attempt to distance himself from the prime minister or from Mr Ozawa when they were both caught up in debilitating campaign-funding scandals that clobbered the government's popular standing. ""If Mr Kan is chosen, he may have the same problem that Mr Hatoyama faced. The public might consider him to be another puppet of Mr Ozawa,"" says Akihiko Tanaka, a professor of international politics at the University of Tokyo. He would need to show that he represents a clean break from the LDP-style ancien regime if disillusioned voters are to be persuaded that the DPJ represents a real change from the past.","And the next contestant , please

CENTRAL bankers in Western countries are getting used to the idea that part of their job is to try to raise animal spirits after a slump. In Japan, after two decades of stagnation--nominal GDP is at the same level as 1992--Japanese politicians are leaning on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to stir the beasts in ever more inventive ways. Already, interest rates have hovered around zero for a decade, and quantitative easing has flooded the system with funds, to little avail.
This month the BOJ will unveil a radical measure for ""strengthening the foundations for economic growth"" that borders on fiscal policy. It plans to lend to private banks at the policy rate of 0.1% for one year (which is extendable), provided that the funds are used for loans or investments in certain growth sectors. The rate is considerably lower than the 12-month interbank rate. Although the loan size and industries have yet to be specified, the areas are meant to dovetail with the government's growth strategy which will be announced later this month, and is expected to include energy, the environment, space and robotics.
The BOJ's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, admits that the initiative is not ""orthodox"" for a central bank and vows to avoid allocating resources at the microeconomic level; yet that is precisely what it is doing. The move is seen as a way to appease politicians pressing the BOJ to do more to support the economy, notably Naoto Kan, the finance minister, who is expected to ascend to the premiership following the resignation of Yukio Hatoyama. Mr Kan's pressure is particularly ironic considering that the Democratic Party of Japan swept into power last autumn denouncing the previous government's interference into the BOJ. 
The idea behind the initiative is that Japanese animal spirits are merely in hibernation, and a spurt of cash is all it takes to awaken rapacious entrepreneurs from their garages. Of course, Japanese banks are already awash in cash. Much of Japan's colossal household wealth, one of the world's biggest pools of savings, is in cash or deposits earning little interest. Yet these funds can be hard for business to access.
Banks are notoriously stingy lenders, and prefer to place their money in seemingly risk-free Japan government bonds (JGBs). Worryingly, over the past year, net loans at Japan's three ""megabanks"" declined by {Yen}18 trillion, or 8%, according to Bloomberg, while their overall balance sheets grew slightly as they continued favour other assets such as JGBs. 
The BOJ believes that a big cause of Japan's persistent deflation is the economy's low potential growth rate and low productivity, which quantitative easing fails to solve. By encouraging banks to lend, the reasoning goes, it may improve business sentiment to invest. Yet few expect the initiative to do much. Corporate demand for funds is weak, financial institutions must assume the credit risk of these loans, which they do not want, and there is a mismatch of duration between lending for investment (long-term) and fund provision from the BOJ (one year, in principle). Japan's animal spirits remain in deep sleep.

Ichiro Ozawa, the shadow shogun, is outboxed. Japan, at last, has a Kan-do prime minister
FOR a better sense of Naoto Kan's chances as Japan's new prime minister, dwell for a moment on the greatest contribution made by Yukio Hatoyama, his predecessor, during a lifetime dedicated to changing the political order. This was not the obvious one of his resignation on June 2nd, for all the vapidity and vacillation of the less-than-nine months he was in office. Of far greater consequence was the simultaneous downfall of Ichiro Ozawa, the secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the country's greatest living master of the dark political arts and its shadow shogun. For this alone, Mr Hatoyama's name should be praised to the rafters.
The details of the downfall are still emerging. But in the days before Mr Hatoyama's inevitable end, it seems that the more the powerful secretary-general pressed the prime minister to beat it, the more a dreamy, indecisive prime minister got in touch with his inner mule: if he was to fall, Mr Hatoyama insisted, Mr Ozawa would have to fall too. Questions hung over both men about the misuse of political funds, he pointed out, and popular disgust with Mr Ozawa as well as with the prime minister was sending the government's ratings to abysmal depths.
That Mr Ozawa's political career might come to an end matters hugely. Not even Junichiro Koizumi--prime minister from 2001-06 and in a league of his own for charisma and boldness--has so stamped the course of Japanese politics.
When he stormed out of the Liberal Democratic Party in 1993, Mr Ozawa had seen before almost anyone that the LDP's cold-war dominance had outlived its usefulness. A weak state--albeit, in effect, a one-party one; a constitution that constrains action abroad; and a cultural cringe from American dominance in post-war relations: all prevented Japan from becoming, in his words, a ""normal"" nation. ""Normal"" would have to mean organising political competition not around personality and pork but the policy choices of two main parties competing for office.
The LDP's defeat in last August's general election appeared to vindicate Mr Ozawa in spades. But by then, less appealing traits had trumped his reformist leanings. They included a taste for the Machiavellian in the exercise of power that undermined the DPJ's formal governance. They also included LDP-style patronage and pork as an electoral and governing strategy, particularly in rural districts. The strategy patently worked last summer. But the electorate did not vote out the LDP in order to see the DPJ start emulating it. The more Mr Ozawa bossed his party, the more popular opinion wanted him out.
Mr Kan, who first brought Mr Ozawa into the DPJ, was slow to recognise the liability he had become. But having got the message, he has moved with characteristic decisiveness. Mr Hatoyama, grandson of a prime minister, was born with an effete sense of political entitlement. Mr Kan fought his way up through scrappy urban politics rather than the pork-strewn rural sort from which most of his predecessors have come. He owes Mr Ozawa nothing and is already warning the bruiser off.
The few important ministerial changes he made to the existing cabinet line-up, unveiled on June 8th, make for a modernising, pointedly anti-Ozawa government. The new chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, the prime minister's gatekeeper on government policy, will want to deal seriously with both Japan's national debt and its deflation. The finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, is also keen to trim election promises. Crucially, Mr Kan has retaken control of the party apparatus by installing as secretary-general Yukio Edano, whom Mr Ozawa loathes.
But most tellingly of all, early surveys of public opinion show a big bounce in the government's popularity. Mr Kan can expect to take credit for the DPJ's doing less disastrously than expected in elections for the upper house of the Diet (parliament) next month. The bounce will also dent support for Mr Ozawa among Diet members. Commentators had divined a large pro-Ozawa group, which included 142 freshmen, known as ""Ozawa's children"", who owed their seats to his tactical backing. Mr Ozawa had sway over his children for as long as he held the whip. Now Mr Kan offers the path to advancement.
And so, for the first time since Mr Koizumi stepped down in 2006, Japan's prime minister gives every impression of being in charge. Possibly that will not last. Mr Ozawa, who is 68, has suffered countless reverses before, only to charge back. Perhaps the wavy-locked Mr Hatoyama was not Samson to Mr Ozawa's temple after all. The ex-shogun mutters about a challenge to Mr Kan, whose leadership of the DPJ (and, by extension, of the country) must be put to a party vote in the autumn. ""Our fight will come in September,"" an aggrieved Mr Ozawa is said to have told his closest followers last week, while pouring them sake.
Mr Ozawa has one more means of destruction: the nuclear option of leading his true supporters out of the party. The DPJ's hopes of governing majorities in both houses would then be in jeopardy. Mr Ozawa has done as much before, ending the only other period of non-LDP rule a decade and a half ago. A big risk, ample rewards
For all the fresh turmoil it would entail, such an exit might have its rewards, by hastening a political realignment in Japanese politics, which began with the LDP's ousting last August yet which still has no end in sight. It would, for instance, make it easier for the DPJ to make common cause with newer parties of a more liberal, market-friendly hue, such as the increasingly popular Your Party, which are loth to do business with a party on which Mr Ozawa's shadow still falls. Should Mr Ozawa want to make a public show of forsaking the party he has long dominated, and provoking a bruising confrontation, well then, bring it on.","Economist.com/blogs/banyan

NAOTO KAN, Japan's new prime minister, seems to have a soft spot for the Britain of 1997, when Tony Blair's New Labour swept to power. In his first few weeks in office, Mr Kan has not only pulled off the Blairite trick of giving his party's old guard the slip. He has also wrapped himself in slogans redolent of the 1990s.
The manifesto of his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) for elections to the upper house of the Diet, or parliament, on July 11th begins by promising voters a ""Third Way"" of economic policy. His government talks of private-finance initiatives. His fiscal plans are full of the word ""prudent"". Mr Kan believes Japan is sitting on a dangerous heap of debt. ""If things go wrong, we could end up like Greece,"" he warned on television this week.
As quaintly last-century as some of his slogans appear, they strike an unusually bold change of direction in Japanese politics. Since Mr Kan took office on June 8th, replacing his discredited predecessor Yukio Hatoyama, he has yanked the DPJ--at least if you believe its manifesto--from a party of welfare largesse to one of fiscal discipline. Rival parties have joined the hair-shirt brigade. Suddenly, a debate on raising Japan's consumption tax--at 5%, the lowest in the rich world--has vaulted to the centre of a national election campaign. In the general election last year that ended five decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the DPJ's manifesto did not even mention the gaping hole in Japan's public finances. 
Promising higher taxes to deflation-coshed voters just ahead of an important election would be a strange calculation in any country. In Japan it has additional political and economic poignancy. The consumption tax reaped devastating results for its supporters in upper-house elections shortly after it was introduced in 1989. After it was raised to 5% in 1997, it once more harmed its sponsors and helped derail Japan's economic recovery, plunging the country into a second lost decade of economic growth.
But Mr Kan appears to have judged that, for three reasons, an election fought over tax will be less risky than in the past. First, because more voters acknowledge a rise in the consumption tax is necessary; second, because he hopes to achieve cross-party support for it; and third, because he can finesse the timing, depending on the health of the economy.
The first calculation is helped by the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe. Since January, when Mr Kan was finance minister in Mr Hatoyama's government, he has been arguing ever more frequently that Japan, the country with the largest gross-debt-to-GDP ratio in the developed world, is living beyond its means. For now, Japan has no trouble raising funds to meet its debts, and interest rates on government bonds are barely above 1%. But the finance ministry argues that within the next several years, debt on its current trajectory will exceed national savings, in which case Japan would have to look abroad for funding. 
That, government officials believe, has alarmed the public enough for it to accept that some belt-tightening is unavoidable, though opinion polls send contradictory signals. On the one hand, two newspapers reported this week that more people favour a higher consumption tax than are against it. On the other hand, support for the DPJ, which doubled to about 40% after Mr Kan took over from Mr Hatoyama, dipped this week after he mentioned the tax rise (see chart).
Happily for the DPJ, it is not alone in demanding higher taxes. The LDP and one marginal small party also call for a higher consumption tax in their manifestos. (Cunningly, Mr Kan has even referred to LDP's proposal that the tax should double, to 10%, as a ""reference point"", without stating a figure of his own.)
Not only does this deflect some of the heat onto the DPJ's rivals, but it may also put the DPJ in a stronger position after the elections. On today's voter preferences, political analysts believe the DPJ is likely to fall about five seats short of the additional 60 in the upper house that it needs for a simple majority (see table). But if other parties including the LDP believe a higher consumption tax is necessary, it may be able to draw on their support in a vote. That would forgo the need for a more formal coalition of the type that helped doom Mr Hatoyama's tenure.
Mr Kan has accompanied his party's manifesto with lengthy documents on fiscal reform and ways to rekindle sustainable economic growth after two decades of stagnation. Neither are particularly ambitious. The cut in the deficit from 6.4% to 3.2% is not envisaged before 2015, ie, three years after the administration must hold another general election. Its nominal GDP-growth targets are meagre. Even the consumption tax may not rise for two or three years, according to Mr Kan.
Some argue that the timing is not bold enough. However, for all that Japan needs strong economic leadership, there is a danger in being over-zealous on the public finances. Though the economy barrelled along at a 5% annualised clip in the first quarter, it is still running well below capacity and remains dependent on exports to China. Wage growth is miserly. Some argue that even the DPJ's plans to freeze spending at 2010 levels may be too austere for such a fragile economy.
More pressing than fiscal austerity, economists say, is the need to encourage a strong, well-balanced economy by deregulating inefficient industries and encouraging more investment. If not, the country will remain brutally exposed to the ups and downs of the global economy, and its efforts at fiscal prudence may come to nothing. That, Mr Kan might note, is the depressing 21st-century legacy of New Labour's 20th-century sloganeering.","Naoto Kan tries a novel campaign strategy for upper - house elections

At their most recent gathering, in Toronto on June 26th-27th, the club's rich-world members pledged ""at least"" to halve their deficits by 2013. Though they left themselves wiggle room, the change of tone was clear. Thanks to Greece's sovereign-debt crisis, which has terrified politicians, stimulus is out and deficit reduction is in. 
The trend has been most noticeable in Europe, where every big economy has spelled out spending cuts or tax increases in recent weeks. But it is evident everywhere. Japan's new prime minister, Naoto Kan, has pushed a debate about raising the consumption tax to the top of the campaign for the upper house of parliament. In America, Congress's fears about the deficit have thwarted the Obama administration's efforts to pass a new mini-stimulus (
). 
Until recently the deficit-cutting rhetoric exaggerated its likely short-term impact. Germany has long been one of the loudest proponents of the need for austerity. But its near-term plans (tightening worth 0.4% of GDP in 2011) are modest. Spain was the only big European economy forced by financial markets into immediate, tough austerity. Yet now Britain has chosen that route, with a budget that promises tightening worth 2% of GDP in 2011. The expiration of America's stimulus implies a fiscal tightening of some 1.3% of GDP in 2011, a figure which could rise considerably if Congress prevented the extension of George Bush's tax cuts. Much could change, but for now the rich world looks set for a collective fiscal adjustment worth around 1% of its combined GDP next year, the biggest synchronised budget contraction in at least four decades. Goodbye Keynes, hello Hoover
To Keynesian critics the switch to austerity is a colossal blunder. Paul Krugman, an economist who writes in the New York Times, frets that officials who ""seem to be getting their talking points from the collected speeches of Herbert Hoover"" will push the world economy into a depression. With unemployment high, output far below its potential, private spending still weak and interest rates close to zero, Mr Krugman and his allies argue that fiscal stimulus remains an essential prop to the economy and that deficit-cutting now will spell stagnation and deflation.
From the other side, supporters of the shift to austerity believe it is both essential and appropriate: deficit spending cannot go on for ever, and by boosting firms' and households' confidence and lowering the risk premium on government debt, well-designed fiscal consolidation can actually boost growth. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, argues that fiscal thrift will increase private spending by reducing uncertainty about government tax policy and debt. 
Both sides of this debate oversimplify their cases. Mr Krugman's crude Keynesianism underplays the link between firms' and households' behaviour and their expectations of future tax and spending policy. For example, firms across the rich world are hoarding cash. Their reluctance to invest may have more to do with regulatory, financial and fiscal uncertainty than weak consumer demand (
). If governments address those worries, businesspeople may start spending.
The advocates of austerity exaggerate more dangerously still. They base their argument on cases in the 1990s, when countries such as Canada to Sweden cut their deficits and boomed. But in most of these instances interest rates fell sharply or the country's currency weakened. Those remedies are not available now: interest rates are already low and rich-country currencies cannot all depreciate at once. Without those cushions, fiscal austerity is not likely to boost growth.
The austerity fad is also distorting politicians' priorities. Many European governments, for instance, are fixated on cutting their deficits, when they should also be trying harder to shake up their labour and product markets. A new analysis by the IMF suggests that fiscal austerity coupled with structural reforms would yield far higher growth than austerity alone. In America the new deficit-focused climate is preventing politicians from passing a temporary (and sensible) fiscal stimulus package without inducing them to tackle the sources of the country's huge medium-term deficit by, for instance, reforming social security. The result probably won't be another Hooveresque Depression. But it could be a recovery that is weaker and slower than it should have been.","Both sides in the row over stimulus v austerity exaggerate, but the austerity lobby is the more dangerous

THE result of the election on July 11th, in which the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) lost control of the upper house of Japan's Diet (parliament), is awful news not just for the prime minister, Naoto Kan, and his party. On the face of it, it is awful news for Japan as well. Mr Kan faces the prospect of being unable to get anything done. After years of economic stagnation, it is tempting to conclude from yet another political failure that Japan is truly ungovernable. But at a deeper level, the vote also suggests that Japan is changing--for the better. 
After last August's optimism the mood is black. Back then voters made history in a general election that kicked out the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Its last, painful years in office had been marked by sleaze, ineptitude and political gridlock. Less than a year later, when both jobs and social protection are inadequate and the national debt is soaring, the DPJ has itself been tainted by sleaze; in office it has proven inept; and the election result threatens renewed gridlock. 
For Mr Kan the vote is a huge setback. He came to office only six weeks ago, offering hope. The straight-talking man of the people seemed everything that his predecessor, the first DPJ prime minister, was not. Yukio Hatoyama, rich, quixotic and indecisive, had met his end picking a needless fight with the United States over the relocation of a military base on Okinawa and then flip-flopping over how to resolve it. When he went, so too did Ichiro Ozawa, the party's ""shadow shogun"". Mr Ozawa subjugated policy and principle to winning elections with pork and deficit spending. His style closely resembled the old LDP which the DPJ had set itself against, and with both men gone, support for the DPJ grew.
Then Mr Kan blew it. His proposal to double the consumption tax in order to plug the national finances before Japan became another Greece was meant to sound like responsible politics. But the proposal looked as if it had been scribbled on the back of an envelope. And when a hostile media asked what effect more taxes would have on jobs and growth, Mr Kan flipped and flopped, Hatoyama-style. Behind the rice-paper screen
Mr Kan's future, and the DPJ's, is now in doubt. Some predict the return of Mr Ozawa's malign influence, his anti-Kan sniping vindicated. Thankfully that is unlikely--and not just because of Mr Ozawa's reputation. The opposition will also exploit suspicions over his use of party funds. Others may challenge Mr Kan for the DPJ leadership in September. If so, Japan's sixth prime minister in four years might go first.
In the short run, all this is bad news, particularly if the DPJ draws the wrong lesson and shelves discussion of a consumption tax. Amid the rubble of the DPJ's defeat, however, voters sent encouraging signals. Reformers should seize on them.
For one thing, although LDP's gains have cheered the old guard, the success is deceptive. It came in the LDP's traditional strongholds: the depopulated rural districts with a disproportionate share of the seats. When you look at votes for the seats allocated on the basis of proportional representation, the LDP's national share, at just 24% of the total, extended a long decline. This was no turnaround for the dinosaur party.
Second, the DPJ flopped mainly because candidates backing better government and pro-market growth did especially well. The sparkling performer was Your Party (
), which champions the kind of reforms associated with Junichiro Koizumi, swashbuckling LDP prime minister in 2001-06. Moreover some of the LDp's gains were made by notable followers of Mr Koizumi. The leaderships of both main parties have denigrated the Koizumi legacy for too long.
Third, in spite of their amazing fickleness in recent elections, voters have each time swung towards parties holding out the promise of reform. And each time they have then punished those who came to power and failed to deliver. The gap between people's expectations and the ability of the political system to meet them is wide. The old political order is in ruins. The new one is a shambles, but it is inching towards something better. Elections give voters the chance to prod it in the right direction.
Eventually, this should lead to a less dysfunctional political class that is able to address Japan's difficulties. Mr Kan can play his part, by using this summer's leadership contest to move his party towards the reformist centre, where it has most chance of finding common cause with the opposition (
).
If Mr Kan cannot manage this, it would be better to call a snap general election. That would put the whole question back to the voters--who seem to understand what Japan needs rather better than the people who govern them.","The bad news is that gridlock is back .

FOR the second time in less than six weeks the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is engaged in some deep soul searching. A stunning upset in upper-house elections on July 11th has damaged the credibility of Naoto Kan, the prime minister who took over from his even more discredited predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, in early June.
Just ten months after it routed the long-ruling Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) in an historic election, Mr Kan's party faces what is known in Japan as a ""twisted Diet"": it does not have enough power in either chamber of parliament to get laws passed. In the election for half the seats in the upper house, the DPJ won just 44, whereas the long-in-the-tooth LDP recouped 51--its highest tally since 2001. The DPJ remains the largest party in both chambers, but it is 16 seats short of an upper-house majority (see chart). No party with anything like enough seats to narrow the gap has sounded willing to join a ruling coalition.
Within the DPJ, at least, the prime minister is blamed for scaring voters with muddled talk about an eventual increase in the consumption tax. Within 24 hours of the election, DPJ leaders made it clear that they were no longer committed to any deadlines for discussing the tax.
Mr Kan has vowed to struggle on, but it is customary in Japan for party leaders to pay a high price for election upsets; he may be ousted in a previously scheduled party-leadership contest this summer. If so, he would be forced to go as prime minister, too-becoming the fifth Japanese leader to suffer an ignoble exit in four years.
Yet before it jettisons Mr Kan the DPJ should be wary of jumping to the wrong conclusions about the vote. The results were not as unremittingly bad as the seat numbers suggest.
Koichi Nakano of Sophia University in Tokyo points out that Japan's distorted electoral map exaggerates the size of the defeat: the DPJ lost heavily against LDP candidates in depopulated rural areas that are considered to be the opposition's heartland, but which produce a disproportionate number of seats. By contrast in urban areas, DPJ candidates did better than those of its main rival. Some voters hedged their bets in the proportional-representation part of the ballot by supporting the new Your Party that is fast emerging as a third force in Japanese politics (see box on next page). But the DPJ still got the largest share of support in this part of the vote--32% versus 24% for the LDP.
As for a rise in the consumption tax, an opinion survey conducted at the polling stations by Asahi Shimbun, a newspaper, found that more voters favoured a doubling in the tax, to 10%, than were against it. Those most staunchly opposed were women in their 20s, many of whom earn meagre wages. Some of those could expect to be covered by exemptions. On July 14th the imf recommended that Japan increase the tax to 15%, starting next year.
The LDP, which gave more detail on the need for higher consumption taxes in its manifesto, found the idea gained little momentum, said Yoshimasa Hayashi, a politician in the party who campaigned with upper-house candidates in rural areas. Provided discussion of exactly how high taxes would have to rise was left vague, most people were sympathetic to the need to put Japan's debt-ridden public finances in order. ""If I said fiscal consolidation, everybody said 'yes',"" reported Mr Hayashi. 
In that case, Mr Kan's problems may have stemmed from his ill-prepared presentation of the tax debate--he gave mixed messages on what the money would be used for and who would be exempted--rather than the debate itself. ""His punishment seems to be disproportionate to his crime,"" Mr Nakano says.
A more sobering lesson for the DPJ is that voters are sick of half-baked policy proposals. They helped doom Mr Hatoyama, when he stumbled into a fruitless row with America over the relocation of a marine base in the Japanese island of Okinawa. Mr Kan's tax proposals may just have been one woolly idea too many.
As the party prepares for a leadership race, it may be split between those loyal to Mr Kan and others who support Ichiro Ozawa, an old-style, pork-barrel populist who resigned alongside Mr Hatoyama last month and has continued to snipe at Mr Kan from the sidelines. But rather than focusing on personalities, Japan needs a rigorous and long-overdue policy debate.
Reform-minded upper-house LDP politicians like Mr Hayashi say they would be prepared to support the DPJ on issues such as the consumption tax if it scraps some of its more reckless public-spending proposals, such as universal child allowances. Other parties share its goal of slimming the bureaucracy.
Such voices may well be drowned out by those seeking to force the DPJ to call a new general election--with or without Mr Kan in charge. If it does not try to win them over, however, the electoral arithmetic means it has almost no chance of governing, however long it can cling to power.","Naoto Kan has been battered at the polls .

JAPAN has been dining out on the story this month of the arrest of its hot-dog-eating champ, Takeru ""The Tsunami"" Kobayashi, in Coney Island, New York, for his overzealous attempts to gatecrash an international speed-eating contest. Another tale of gargantuan appetite deserves more attention than it is getting. Japan's megabanks have been gobbling up Japanese government bonds (JGBs) in huge quantities. But for how much longer? 
Purchases of JGBs by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFJ), Japan's biggest bank, have more than doubled, to {Yen}38 trillion ($427 billion) in March from {Yen}15 trillion two years earlier. They account for about 18% of its balance-sheet. Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho, the second- and third-largest financial groups respectively, have followed a similar trend.
The purchases have helped the banks compensate for slumping loan demand in Japan. The government is happy, too: demand has brought benchmark ten-year yields down to nearly 1%. The banks have stepped into the breach as public-pension funds become net sellers of JGBs to provide funds to retiring baby-boomers. 
But there are concerns that the banks may eventually reach saturation point. Kazuto Uchida, chief economist at MUFJ, says he has briefed the government of Naoto Kan about the pressures the banks will face to diversify their assets. He believes concerns about the strength of domestic demand for JGBs--95% of Japanese bonds are held locally--may be one reason Mr Kan has grown increasingly anxious about the public finances.
Mr Uchida notes that under Basel 2 bank-capital rules there are so-called ""outlier criteria"" for banks with a heavy exposure to interest-rate risk, such as the Japanese banks. This will eventually limit how many JGBs the Japanese banks can hold. Under a stressed scenario in which JGB yields move up or down by two percentage points, the loss the banks would suffer must not exceed 20% of Tier-1 and Tier-2 capital. That would be a big move in yields but, if market sentiment turns, a perfectly possible one. Mr Uchida says Japanese banks are currently well below the 20% threshold (MUFJ does not reveal its level; Mizuho put its at 8.5% in March 2009). But if they continue to increase their holdings at the current pace, in a number of years they may exceed it, Mr Uchida says.
There are other factors that may suppress the banks' appetite. For the time being, MUFJ executives describe their role in buying JGBs as part of a ""public mission"": they recycle an excess of money in the household sector to the government, which is short of funds. The banks have a vested interest in keeping the bond market stable. If they were rapidly to reduce their holdings, long-term interest rates would rise, which would hurt them, their customers and the economy at large. But if loan demand starts to grow again, the banks will have to respond if they are not to lose business to international rivals. To stay competitive, the banks need the flexibility to switch from buying JGBs to funding private-sector growth.
Analysts say it is not known whether the ""outlier criteria"" will survive the switch from Basel 2 to Basel 3 but they are still nervous about the banks' exposure to interest-rate risk. ""The level of JGBs that the banks have is becoming of increasingly great concern. Interest rates in Japan won't stay as low as they are forever,"" notes Brian Waterhouse at CLSA, a brokerage.
If that is also the message that the banks are conveying to Mr Kan, his government should be troubled. In explaining to voters his controversial decision to review Japan's consumption tax ahead of upper-house elections on July 11th, Mr Kan said he was worried that Japan would eventually end up like Greece. Without docile domestic buyers of JGBs to rely on, that would be more than just electoral hyperbole.","Naoto Kan's banks may soon chafe at their mission to support the bond market

The banks have stepped into the breach as public - pension funds become net sellers of JGBs to provide funds to retiring baby - boomers . 
 But there are concerns that the banks may eventually reach saturation point . Kazuto Uchida , chief economist at MUFJ , says he has briefed Naoto Kan about the pressures the banks will face to diversify their assets . He believes concerns about the strength of domestic demand for JGBs--95 % of Japanese bonds are held locally -- may be one reason Mr Kan has grown increasingly anxious about the public finances . 
 Mr Uchida notes that under Basel 2 bank - capital rules there are so - called "" outlier criteria "" for banks with a heavy exposure to interest - rate risk , such as the Japanese banks . This will eventually limit how many JGBs the Japanese banks can hold . Under a stressed scenario in which JGB yields move up or down by two percentage points , the loss the banks would suffer must not exceed 20 % of Tier-1 and Tier-2 capital . That would be a big move in yields but , if market sentiment turns , a perfectly possible one . Mr Uchida says Japanese banks are currently well below the 20 % threshold ( MUFJ does not reveal its level ; Mizuho put its at 8.5 % in March 2009 ) . But if they continue to increase their holdings at the current pace , in a number of years they may exceed it , Mr Uchida says . 
 There are other factors that may suppress the banks ' appetite . For the time being , MUFJ executives describe their role in buying JGBs as part of a "" public mission "" : they recycle an excess of money in the household sector to Naoto Kan . The banks have a vested interest in keeping the bond market stable . If they were rapidly to reduce their holdings , long - term interest rates would rise , which would hurt them , their customers and the economy at large . But if loan demand starts to grow again , the banks will have to respond if they are not to lose business to international rivals . To stay competitive , the banks need the flexibility to switch from buying JGBs to funding private - sector growth . 
 Analysts say it is not known whether the "" outlier criteria "" will survive the switch from Basel 2 to Basel 3 but they are still nervous about the banks ' exposure to interest - rate risk . "" The level of JGBs that the banks have is becoming of increasingly great concern . Interest rates in Naoto Kan wo n't stay as low as they are forever , "" notes Brian Waterhouse at CLSA , a brokerage . 
 If that is also the message that the banks are conveying to Mr Kan , Naoto Kan's should be troubled . In explaining to voters his controversial decision to review Naoto Kan's consumption tax ahead of upper - house elections on July 11th , Mr Kan said he was worried that Naoto Kan would eventually end up like Greece . Without docile domestic buyers of JGBs to rely on , that would be more than just electoral hyperbole .",740,Japan,A30-187,IN TERM,True,the government of Naoto Kan,13,True

AS THE financial crisis hit in late 2008, Meccano, a French maker of construction toys, watched its pre-Christmas sales slip. Its banks got jittery and things looked difficult for the 103-year-old firm (which was born British, in Liverpool). The government stepped in. In July 2009 the Fonds Strategique d'Investissement (FSI), a sovereign-wealth fund set up in 2008 by the president, Nicolas Sarkozy, invested EUR 2.2m ($3.1m). ""Should toymaking now be considered strategic for France?"" asked a business radio station. The firm will bring jobs home. In February Meccano said it would repatriate manufacturing jobs from China to its headquarters in Calais.
France's tinkering with Meccano is a part of a renewed trend of industrial intervention by governments in rich countries. America has pumped billions into banks and carmakers, taking large stakes. Barack Obama said in 2009 that the government must make ""strategic decisions about strategic industries"". His stimulus plan last year earmarked billions for innovation in sectors such as renewable energy, high-speed rail and advanced vehicles. 
Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, said in April that the government wanted to create a new ""Japan Inc"", deepening the links between business and the state. In June the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced a strategy to combat the ""increasingly aggressive"" industrial policies of America, Britain, China, France, Germany and South Korea. Mighty MITI, as METI's forerunner, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, used to be known, will ride forth again. 
Like America, European countries have lavished money on banks and carmakers. The European Commission will unveil a new, active industrial strategy later this year, which will pay more attention to manufacturing and less to services and ""knowledge"" industries. ""Industrial policy is no longer taboo,"" says Mario Monti, a former competition commissioner. ""There's a revival of demand for it."" France's government, having retreated from directing industry in recent years, launched a heavily interventionist policy in March, vowing to lift manufacturing output by a quarter over five years. As well as setting up the FSI, Mr Sarkozy plans to exert tighter control over companies in which the state still has stakes. This week he ordered their bosses to report formally to ministers every six months.
Inspired by the French, Britain's Labour government last year set up a Strategic Investment Fund to steer Pounds 750m ($1.2 billion) of state money to particular industries and companies. The Conservative-led coalition has since rejected what it calls a ""new interventionism"" around the world. It has cancelled some loans, such as one to Sheffield Forgemasters, a northern steel firm. But much of Labour's plan remains.
Poorer countries have tried to promote chosen industries as a way of speeding up economic development. There too, it is becoming respectable again. Dani Rodrik, a professor at Harvard University, says that the World Bank, after decades of consensus that industrial policy doesn't work for developing nations, is now recommending its use. A recent paper by Justin Lin, the bank's chief economist, and a colleague, Celestin Monga, examines how governments can identify possibly successful policies and likely failures. Jobs, greenery, momentum and fear
In rich countries four main forces are driving the revival of industrial policy. First is the weak state of the world economy. Governments are under pressure to reduce unemployment and stimulate growth: support for chosen industries is a way of saving jobs and helping local firms fight foreign competitors. Second, some countries, such as America and Britain, want to rebalance their economies away from finance and property. Along with older manufacturing, clean technology is emerging as a favourite direction. Nearly every large economy has plans to win global market share and create green jobs.
Third, emergency use of industrial-policy tools leads to demands for more. Mr Obama has responded to complaints that only big companies such as General Motors and AIG, an insurer, have enjoyed the state's largesse by setting up a $30 billion small-business lending fund. Fourth, rich countries are responding to the apparently successful policies of fast-growing economies, notably China and South Korea.
Industrial policy remains controversial. Defined as the attempt by government to promote the growth of particular industrial sectors and companies, there have been successes, but also many expensive failures. Policy may be designed to support or restructure old, struggling sectors, such as steel or textiles, or to try to construct new industries, such as robotics or nanotechnology. Neither tack has met with much success. Governments rarely evaluate the costs and benefits properly.
In America the debate has raged fiercely. The government has long helped business, for instance through the Small Business Administration (SBA), set up in 1953, which guarantees loans to small firms. Heavy defence and space spending has created national champions, such as Boeing in aircraft-making. The government bailed out Lockheed in 1971 and Chrysler in 1979, and raised motorbike tariffs in 1983 to save Harley-Davidson. But efforts to support specific industries and firms have remained sporadic despite calls for a coherent policy. Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior tried to eliminate industrial policy wherever they found it, says Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr Bush. 
The Obama administration has laid out an innovation strategy for sectors of national importance, citing past examples of where government intervention benefited industry. Programmes such as the SBA, short of resources under previous administrations, will get more money, and the government will set up a national network of business incubators. ""While there has always been some level of industrial policy it has waxed and waned at a low level in previous administrations,"" says Mr Boskin. ""The Obama administration has greatly expanded its size and scope.""
America can claim perhaps the most important industrial-policy success, in the early development of the internet and Silicon Valley. The Defence Department's Defence Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) supported the creation of ARPANET, the predecessor of the internet, despite a lack of interest from the private sector. Israel's government was similarly successful in boosting its early-stage venture-capital industry with its $100m Yozma fund, which supported foreign investors backing Israeli start-ups. In July Israel said it would give its high-tech industry a new boost, including tax breaks for start-ups and guarantees for Israeli pension funds that invest in venture capital. France can claim successes in nuclear power and high-speed rail. Airbus, an aircraft-maker jointly controlled by France, Germany and Spain, is another European example. 
But missteps and failures are more usual. In Britain a long list of disasters, from cars to semiconductors, is etched in the public's memory. France's biggest blunder has been its attempt to construct an information-technology industry. With a few exceptions, such as Israel's, governments usually fail in attempts to boost entrepreneurship, according to ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", a book by Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School. MITI wasn't always mighty
Even supposed masters of industrial policy made embarrassing mistakes. Japan's MITI once opposed carmakers' plans to export and tried to stop Honda expanding from motorbikes into cars because it didn't want another company in the industry. ""Probably I would have been even more successful had we not had MITI,"" Soichiro Honda, the company's founder, said of his battles with the ministry. 
The more globally competitive and open an industry, the harder it is for governments to promote companies effectively. The semiconductor business demonstrates this well, argues the McKinsey Global Institute. Although America, South Korea and Taiwan established enduringly successful semiconductor industries, others have so far wasted billions (see table). 
Will the new wave of activist policy prove any more successful? The most feared of all industrial strategies is China's. China has pumped billions into ""pillar"" industries such as telecoms, information technology, car manufacturing and steel. The country has clocked up giddy GDP growth rates. It boasts the world's most valuable bank, its biggest mobile-phone operator and its largest pile of foreign-exchange reserves. Its growing economic power is one of the things that has had richer countries looking for new industrial policies of their own.
Yet China's own industrial policy is a mixed bag--in particular, in developing technological prowess. On the success side, according to Denis Simon, co-author of ""Technological Innovation in China"", is the Loongson or Dragon chip, developed with money from the state's high-tech development plan. The new chip is expected to wean China's computer industry quickly off dependence on foreign central-processing units. China plans to export the chips too. Government funding also built a strong presence in supercomputers. 
But Mr Simon argues that the state's various high-tech programmes have left China's leaders disappointed. Other parts of industrial policy have misfired, such as attempts to support domestic technology by setting standards. The government tried to promote a home-grown 3G technology, TD-SCDMA, or TD-S, against foreign standards. By the time the government was ready to introduce it, Huawei and ZTE, a smaller rival, were already doing well abroad with no help from TD-S. In 2008 the government forced China Mobile, the world's largest mobile operator, to adopt the technology, but even this huge firm has struggled to sell it to its customers, mainly because of the lack of TD-S handsets. There is little chance that TD-S will ever be adopted outside China, and Chinese firms are hoping to move on to a 4G standard as quickly as possible. 
Japanese industry, which has a leading position in nuclear power, got a shock when South Korea unexpectedly won a contract to supply four reactors to the United Arab Emirates last December. One reason was deemed to be lack of marketing support from government ministers. On June 1st, after years of stepping back from explicit intervention in the economy, METI announced a comprehensive strategy to promote five strategic sectors: infrastructure, environmental products, medical services, cultural industries and new fields such as robotics and space. With remarkable precision, METI projects that government support will drive these sectors to increase their collective market size by {Yen}27.4 trillion ($318.7 billion) by 2020, with a net increase of 2.579m jobs. 
Some of METI's new measures, such as reviewing immigration laws, make sense (Japan attracts only a tiny number of highly educated foreign workers). Picking so many sectors as winners, however, may dilute any impact on each one. And there is little sign of much desire to reduce protection to make industries more competitive. In food products, another area regularly touted as ripe for export growth, abundant protection for local farmers distorts the market and reduces competitiveness. 
Of all the new strategies, France's politique industrielle looks the most defensive and politically driven. The FSI has invested in growth businesses, for instance creating a new biotechnology fund, but it has also put money into companies such as Valeo, an 87-year-old car-parts firm recently targeted by foreign activist shareholders for poor performance. It plans to invest in the remains of Pechiney, a former aluminium champion bought by Canada's Alcan some years ago. One of the main risks of state investment in companies--to allocate money for political reasons--is already apparent. The FSI has come under pressure to rescue Heuliez, a bankrupt maker of car parts based in the home region of Segolene Royale, a former presidential candidate. 
In Britain the coalition accused Labour of also using its new industrial policy for political gain. Vince Cable, the business secretary, says the government will not ""wave a chequebook"" at industry. He will concentrate more on measures such as simplifying regulation and lowering taxes for business. The loan to Sheffield Forgemasters, which wanted to break into the market for the very heaviest components for nuclear-power plants, has been cancelled. But the new government has confirmed several other decisions made by Labour, such as a Pounds 360m loan guarantee to Ford for research and development of green vehicle engines, and Pounds 3.9m for Michelin, a French company, to modernise a tyre factory in Stoke-on-Trent. Green dreams
Clean technology has captured the imagination of several governments, which are spending hundreds of billions in the hope of creating many jobs as well as meeting carbon-emissions targets. Many will find they wasted money, says Michael Liebreich, chief executive of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which advises investors on renewables and energy technology. Most countries are trying to do the same things and not all will succeed. ""Where the industry ends up will inevitably be different from where the money went in,"" says Mr Liebreich. Green manufacturing jobs may find their home mostly in China, not America, and China may struggle to make its mark in the research-and-development end of the industry, he says. Both are investing a lot (see chart on previous page).
Some green industrial policies have backfired already. Spain's fixed-price subsidy system for solar energy has been a disaster. The state dramatically underestimated the quantity of energy that would be sold at subsidised prices. Since the government picked up the extra cost to consumers in the short term but put no cap on the number of solar plants that could claim the high prices, it built up a huge off-balance-sheet liability. This week Spain said it would cut the guaranteed price to solar-power producers by up to 45%, angering investors in renewable plants.
Despite promises that they are not out to pick winners this time around, in green technology governments are doing exactly that. In April the European Commission anointed the electric car as the green vehicle of the future, giving warning that American and Asian competitors were moving ahead with their own programmes. Picking champions in clean technology is a mistake just as it was in older industries, says James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute. A better approach would be to concentrate efforts on creating demand for green products and services by setting a carbon price, he says. Policymakers should leave individual products to emerge from the market. 
America's investment of tens of billions to stimulate new green technology may be the biggest industrial-policy effort in history, according to Mr Rodrik. One slice is a $25 billion low-interest loan programme from the Department of Energy (DoE) for new green vehicles. The DoE has made loans to Nissan, Ford, Tesla Motors, Tenneco and Fisker Automotive, a start-up, for a total of $8.5 billion since the programme started in late 2008. Some in the green-vehicle industry argue that by lending such huge sums, the government is in fact stifling innovation by distorting the private venture-capital market. According to Darryl Siry, former chief marketing officer for Tesla Motors, venture capitalists are now interested only in companies with the DoE's seal of approval, so that the government has become the sole route to funding for new firms in the sector. 
Creating jobs quickly is a priority. Fisker will use its $529m to build and market two designs of plug-in electric cars, the Karma and another, code-named NINA. At the time it sought a loan, it was assembling the Karma in Finland. The DoE suggested that for the NINA, Fisker could shift manufacturing back to America. Exactly $359m of the loan to Fisker, said the White House, would go to revive manufacturing at a factory in Wilmington, Delaware, which was shut by General Motors last year. 
Few quarrel with the need for governments to help business with straightforward ""horizontal"" measures, such as research and development or fostering high-tech skills. But there is no accepted framework for ""vertical"" policy, favouring specific sectors and companies. Governments use industrial-policy tools only marginally more competently than in the past, says Christian Ketels of Harvard Business School. 
The lessons of the past are clear. First, the more it is in step with a national or local economy's comparative advantage, the more likely industrial policy is to succeed. Drives to spur high-tech entrepreneurship in areas of heavy manufacturing, for instance, face a struggle. According to Mr Lin of the World Bank, following comparative advantage has produced clear successes for some developing countries. Chile, for instance, moved from basic industries such as mining, forestry, fishing and agriculture to aluminium smelting, salmon farming and winemaking thanks to a number of government initiatives.
Second, policy is least prone to failure when it follows rather than tries to lead the market. Curiously, Sheffield Forgemasters might have been an example of the former: Westinghouse, an American company, had suggested to the Yorkshire firm that it should try to break Japan's monopoly on ultra-large nuclear steel forgings.
Third, industrial policy works best when a government is dealing with areas where it has natural interest and competence, such as military technology or energy supply. The worst problems unfold when politicians intervene in purely private domains with short-term goals, bailing out old firms to save jobs or spending lavishly on white elephants. The present round of industrial policy will no doubt produce some modest successes--and a crop of whopping failures.","Industrial policy is back in fashion.

At the time it sought a loan, it was assembling the Karma in Finland. The DoE suggested that for the NINA, Fisker could shift manufacturing back to America. Exactly $359m of the loan to Fisker, said the White House, would go to revive manufacturing at a factory in Wilmington, Delaware, which was shut by General Motors last year. 
Few quarrel with the need for governments to help business with straightforward ""horizontal"" measures, such as research and development or fostering high-tech skills. But there is no accepted framework for ""vertical"" policy, favouring specific sectors and companies. Governments use industrial-policy tools only marginally more competently than in the past, says Christian Ketels of Harvard Business School. 
The lessons of the past are clear. First, the more it is in step with a national or local economy's comparative advantage, the more likely industrial policy is to succeed. Drives to spur high-tech entrepreneurship in areas of heavy manufacturing, for instance, face a struggle. According to Mr Lin of the World Bank, following comparative advantage has produced clear successes for some developing countries. Chile, for instance, moved from basic industries such as mining, forestry, fishing and agriculture to aluminium smelting, salmon farming and winemaking thanks to a number of government initiatives.
Second, policy is least prone to failure when it follows rather than tries to lead the market. Curiously, Sheffield Forgemasters might have been an example of the former: Westinghouse, an American company, had suggested to the Yorkshire firm that it should try to break Japan's monopoly on ultra-large nuclear steel forgings.
Third, industrial policy works best when a government is dealing with areas where it has natural interest and competence, such as military technology or energy supply. The worst problems unfold when politicians intervene in purely private domains with short-term goals, bailing out old firms to save jobs or spending lavishly on white elephants. The present round of industrial policy will no doubt produce some modest successes--and a crop of whopping failures.",740,Japan,A30-187,,False,,0,True

ICHIRO OZAWA, Japan's most Machiavellian politician, recently dismissed Americans as ""monocellular""--using a Japanese term that roughly means simplistic. Compared with his scheming mind, Americans should take that as a compliment. On August 26th Mr Ozawa dropped a bombshell that could bring down the government, launching a leadership challenge to the prime minister, Naoto Kan, in an internal election of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
If he were to win on September 14th, Mr Ozawa, 68, would automatically become prime minister, Japan's third this year alone. That would mark a remarkable comeback. Less than three months ago, on June 2nd, he was forced out as the DPJ secretary-general alongside the previous prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, because of poor leadership and his links to a foul-smelling campaign-funding scandal for which he may possibly still face indictment this year.
It is not clear why the ruling party should want him back. An opinion poll in a newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, this month indicated that four out of five people opposed Mr Ozawa having any influential role in government. Yet the DPJ election, in which the party rank-and-file and local politicians have a vote, is mostly decided by the DPJ's 412 MPs. Of these at least 150 are known to be loyal to Mr Ozawa (although others loathe him), whereas Mr Kan lacks a strong faction of his own.
Whether or not Mr Ozawa believes he can win, he has other motives for running. He may be fighting on behalf of the tight political entourage that surrounds him. He said he was persuaded to run by Mr Hatoyama, with whom he has long been close, even though the former prime minister had said two days before that he would back Mr Kan.
Support from Mr Hatoyama could clinch the race because he brings a faction of about 60 MPs, according to Takao Toshikawa, the editor of Tokyo Insideline, a newsletter. He adds that Mr Ozawa is rumoured to have enticed the notoriously fickle Mr Hatoyama by promising to make him foreign minister, if elected. 
Mr Ozawa may be moved by sheer bitterness, too. Mr Kan has tried to drive his rival into the political wilderness in recent months, but then the prime minister badly misjudged the public mood during upper-house elections in July. Mr Ozawa scented revenge. 
Nevertheless his challenge carries grave risks for the DPJ and the country. A divisive race could split the party, which already lacks a majority in the upper house. And it seems to be taking the government's attention away from ruling. The yen is rising and the stockmarket plunging, which is damaging economic confidence. The constant merry-go-round of prime ministers at a time of entrenched deflation is increasingly seen as a national disgrace. 
Mr Ozawa's supporters believe he promises the sort of strong leadership that would let him build coalitions with the opposition. But his conduct at times so resembles that of an old-style faction boss of the 1970s that many, notably in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, treat him with outright scorn. More progressive parties, knowing how much the public despairs of him and how tainted he is by the allegations of scandal, might give him a wide berth as well.

NOT for nothing is Ichiro Ozawa known as ""The Destroyer"". Over a career spent scheming in the back rooms of Japanese politics, he has made and broken alliances, toppled governments and, with laconic disdain, treated transparency and other democratic norms as so many Western pretences. Yet his latest ploy is one of his darkest. In challenging Naoto Kan, the prime minister, as leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), he threatens to bring down Japan's third government in 12 months. Worse, he may destroy what remains of the trust that voters put in the DPJ when it ended 55 years of one-party rule last year. For the good of Japanese democracy, not to mention its own future, the DPJ must reject Mr Ozawa and all that he stands for.
If the challenger does pull off a victory in the vote on September 14th--and he may--he would take over the DPJ a mere three months after he had been forced to step down as secretary-general under the cloud of a political-funding scandal. He would also replace Mr Kan as prime minister--or, if he preferred to stay in the shadows, install a puppet leader in his place. That would be a disaster, even by the sorry standards of recent Japanese politics, in which four prime ministers have come and gone in the past four years.
Among the public and his party at large, Mr Ozawa is hugely unpopular; less than 15% of the DPJ's rank-and-file support him. He has no clear policy platform. Many may justifiably wonder whether he wants to take control of his party purely out of a desire for power, or also to keep the consequences of his murky financial dealings at bay: high office brings immunity from prosecution. 
However, Mr Ozawa is not to be stopped by mere unpopularity. He excels at a form of money politics that has long plagued Japan. Running a formidable electoral machine, he provides finance and campaign management in return for the loyalty of members of parliament. Hence Mr Ozawa controls the biggest group among the DPJ's 412 members of parliament, and their vote is likely to be decisive. Never mind that voters rejected this sort of cronyism when they kicked out the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last year. No matter that few of his faction in parliament have the gravitas even to join an effective cabinet. What counts is that many MPs are only in politics because Mr Ozawa put them there. Be brave
Mr Ozawa's cronies may feel they have no option but to support him. But democratic politics is about choice, and all but the party's most short-sighted politicians face one. Mr Kan badly damaged the party during upper-house elections in July by bumbling into an ill-judged discussion over consumption taxes. But in refusing to make any back-room concessions to Mr Ozawa, and in seeing off Mr Ozawa's sidekick, Yukio Hatoyama, the former prime minister, he has started to earn back the public's respect. Support for his cabinet has risen sharply in the past week. The public seems happy that he has chosen to take the fight with Mr Ozawa out into the open.
Tribal politics has no place in modern Japan. The country, trapped in a 20-year economic funk, needs bold leadership, not blind loyalty. The divisions in the party have already had worrying economic repercussions: the stockmarket this week fell on fears that the government is too weak to stimulate faltering growth and stop a crippling rise in the yen. There is a growing fear that whoever wins the leadership contest will face a split party. That will put it in an even weaker position to cut deals with the opposition.
A fatal rupture need not happen if the DPJ, under Mr Kan, puts its faith not in its own discredited faction bosses, but in the opinion of ordinary voters. A year ago they kicked the LDP into the political outback. In June they left the vapid Mr Hatoyama in no doubt he should resign. The next month they dealt a sharp blow to Mr Kan. If the DPJ picks Mr Ozawa as Japan's next leader, it can expect no mercy.","Japan 's ruling party should cast its most famous member , Ichiro Ozawa , into the wilderness 
 NOT for nothing is Ichiro Ozawa known as "" The Destroyer "" . Over a career spent scheming in the back rooms of Japanese politics , he has made and broken alliances , toppled governments and , with laconic disdain , treated transparency and other democratic norms as so many Western pretences . Yet his latest ploy is one of his darkest . In challenging Naoto Kan as leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , he threatens to bring down Japan 's third government in 12 months . Worse , he may destroy what remains of the trust that voters put in the DPJ when it ended 55 years of one - party rule last year . For the good of Japanese democracy , not to mention its own future , the DPJ must reject Mr Ozawa and all that he stands for . 
 If the challenger does pull off a victory in the vote on September 14th -- and he may -- he would take over the DPJ a mere three months after he had been forced to step down as secretary - general under the cloud of a political - funding scandal . He would also replace Naoto Kan as prime minister -- or , if he preferred to stay in the shadows , install a puppet leader in Naoto Kan's place . That would be a disaster , even by the sorry standards of recent Japanese politics , in which four prime ministers have come and gone in the past four years .

AT THE heart of Ichiro Ozawa's constituency near Oshu City in north-east Japan stands the huge Isawa dam, built of rock. It looks like a monument to the political career of a man fighting against the odds to become Japan's latest prime minister on September 14th. It deserves to be the millstone around his neck.
Conceived in the early 1990s when Mr Ozawa first cast himself as a reformer of Japanese politics, the dam has cost an estimated 244 billion yen ($2.9 billion) yet is still unfinished. Ostensibly its purpose is to provide more irrigation for local rice paddies, and some hydroelectricity. But the impetus its construction has given to the local economy has also helped to keep Mr Ozawa in parliament for the latter part of his 41 years as an MP. 
Known as the Ozawa dam--Isawa and Ozawa sound mischievously similar in Japanese--it, like him, is popular locally (the main dish in a nearby restaurant is called ""Dam Feast""). The 68-year-old has been one of Japan's most prominent political reformers, masterminding a landslide election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) last year and encouraging new electoral rules, for example promoting transparency in fund-raising, since he first galvanised opposition politics in 1993. 
Yet the dam represents the dark side of Mr Ozawa, too. Analysts say his championing of large public-works projects to further his own political ambitions, and his personal disregard for the new rules that he helped put in place, show how he remains a throwback to the ""money-power"" politics that helped to keep the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in government for half a century. ""In so many ways Ozawa's modus operandi is reminiscent of all the bad old ways of LDP politics, which ultimately disqualifies him as a reformer,"" argues Aurelia George Mulgan, a Japan expert at the University of New South Wales, in a new paper. She calls his leadership style ""imperial"".
Money politics may yet bring him to court, too. In January three of his former secretaries were arrested and charged over a land deal in Tokyo that prosecutors, reportedly, suspect might have violated political-financing laws and was part-funded by a construction company working on the Isawa dam. 
Though Mr Ozawa has repeatedly denied knowledge of any murky transactions, he was forced to resign from a high-ranking position in the DPJ in June partly because the scandal was damaging the government's popularity. Prosecutors have twice decided not to press charges against him over the land purchase. But if an inquest into their investigation rules for a second time that he should be indicted (it has already done so once), then he will automatically be charged. Provided, that is, that he is not by then leading the cabinet or part of it, in which case he could by law claim immunity from prosecution.
Despite the scandals Mr Ozawa remains neck-and-neck with Naoto Kan, the prime minister, ahead of a September 14th election to head the DPJ, which in effect decides who will be prime minister. Even some of Mr Ozawa's supporters concede that Mr Kan is marginally more likely to win, because he enjoys more popular support and the nation is sick of a succession of fly-by-night leaders. But Mr Ozawa's chances are bolstered by his following among loyal DPJ parliamentarians, most of whom have benefited from his political patronage as well as his personal nurturing. MPs' votes carry the most weight.
The reason why so many of Mr Ozawa's supporters stick by him shows what an important, and potentially troubling, battle this is for Japan. It appears to be the dominance of pragmatism over principle, and old-style back-room bargaining over more accountable, albeit potentially slower-moving, politics.
One of his most prominent supporters, Goshi Hosono, the DPJ deputy secretary general, ruefully acknowledges Mr Ozawa's links to ""old-money politics"". But he says that he sees Mr Ozawa as a radical reformer who can build bridges with opposition parties, such as the LDP. He believes that without Mr Ozawa's leadership, there would be further paralysis in Japan's hung parliament. Mr Kan may lack his skills.
The boss of a leading construction company in northern Japan talks of Mr Ozawa as a potential saviour, hoping he will be like a samurai strongman who can jolt the moribund economy back to life through massive public-works projects. ""At a time like this, you don't need the clean guys, you need the guys who can get things done,"" he says. ""Ozawa has excelled at getting public works in the countryside. He knows how much rural Japan needs reviving. Most people in the construction industry know he will provide the adrenalin injection quickly."" Contradictory man
Such talk, however self-serving, shows the fragility of the transition from the long dominance by the LDP to a more dynamic system. It also reveals a scepticism that Mr Kan, if he wins, could implement significant reforms that can pull Japan out of two decades of stagnation. Analysts fear that if Mr Ozawa loses, he may bolt from the DPJ, making it even harder to pass legislation--though Mr Hosono insists the party would not split. A rupture would deepen what Gerald Curtis, a Japan scholar at Columbia University, already calls ""a gridlock worse than anything Japan has experienced in half a century"".
But a victory by Mr Ozawa might represent a return to the informal power networks in Japan, which operate away from public scrutiny and accountability. As one former construction-industry boss puts it, Mr Ozawa is not in politics to get rich, but to get power--and money is his means to power. He is already rich: Kyodo news agency this year suggested that Mr Ozawa and his wife, the daughter of a construction magnate, together have assets of almost 2 billion yen, including villas and land in six prefectures, giving him a large potential war chest. But if he wins power, his record is so contradictory it is not clear if he would rule to serve the narrow interests of his clique, or the pressing needs of the country.","Ichiro Ozawa has troubling connections .

YOSHIYUKI SANKAI is one of those people who make you think Japan has a bright future. A professor and entrepreneur, his company, called Cyberdyne, produces robotic suits worn by humans (see picture, above). They let the paralysed walk and give careworkers extra strength to carry the old and infirm to a wheelchair.
For the first time this year, Mr Sankai's ""HAL"" suits have been used in hospitals around the country. But to secure government backing for medical devices that look like something worn by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the ""Terminator"" films, he has always gone to the man at the very top. He could be forgiven for worrying that the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) would vote to chuck out Naoto Kan on September 14th, because that would have meant yet another new prime minister. In the past four years Mr Sankai has met four other Japanese leaders, and each new one has brought a fresh group of officials who needed convincing that Cyberdyne's sci-fi-like devices are safe and reliable.
Fortunately for Mr Sankai, Mr Kan held onto his job this week. He was surely not the only person to feel relieved. The nation at large has been embarrassed by the parade of interchangeable prime ministers. Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has joked that you say good morning to one, and good afternoon to another.
What is more, the margin of Mr Kan's victory provided a rare moment of reassurance. True, almost as many of the DPJ's members of parliament voted for his challenger, Ichiro Ozawa, as they did for Mr Kan. That was because many owed their jobs to Mr Ozawa, a back-room fixer in opposition politics for 17 years. But among the DPJ's 340,000 rank-and-file, Mr Kan won about five times as many votes, as party members recoiled from Mr Ozawa's murky reputation, financial scandals and faction-based political style. Mr Ozawa is deeply unpopular in the country at large and, had he won, his victory might well have been a disaster for the DPJ.
That degree of unpopularity, even for someone as thick-skinned as Mr Ozawa, may limit his power for making further mischief. Until his challenge, Mr Ozawa had a reputation as an electoral mastermind whom his supporters thought indispensable. But his defeat has stripped him of the aura of infallibility, enabling Mr Kan to keep him at close quarters with less fear of being stabbed in the back. If Mr Ozawa now leaves the DPJ (he insists he won't), analysts suspect few MPs would be keen to follow.
But vanquishing Mr Ozawa and holding onto his job for a while longer were the easy bits for Mr Kan. Problems, from a strong yen to an angry China, are already dictating his agenda. Without a two-thirds majority in either upper or lower house, his party will have to forge ad hoc coalitions with the opposition to pass legislation, making him even less a master of his own destiny. And rival parties will be tempted to exploit divisions in the DPJ exposed by Mr Ozawa's challenge, encouraging them to push for concessions in forthcoming budget discussions. All of which suggests Mr Kan's will be a weak government that may not last. 
The main task for Mr Kan, if he wants to reverse that perception, is to articulate some policies that make sense to the many urban voters who support his party--even if they earn him criticism in what many see as the short-sighted national media and the bunker-like bureaucracy. He may win shallow applause for his government's decision on September 15th to intervene to weaken the yen for the first time in more than six years (see page
). This sent the stockmarket soaring. 
But a better idea would be to focus on boosting innovation and productivity so as to rival Japan's cheap-currency competitors like South Korea and China. He could, for example, encourage business clusters near technology institutes to bolster enterprises like Mr Sankai's. Bizarrely, such parks barely exist in Japan.
Meanwhile, an ugly spat with Beijing over the arrest of a Chinese trawlerman for fishing in Japanese waters (see next article) could help clarify two important messages. The first is that Japan has an interest in overcoming more than a century of mistrust between the two countries to build stronger economic ties with China--even if that means fishing in each other's hotly disputed waters.
The second is the importance of maintaining a strong security alliance with America, especially while Japan's relations with China remain as rocky as they have shown to be in the past few days. It will not be easy. This week Mr Kan's chances of implementing an agreement signed with the United States in May to relocate a marine base in Okinawa were dealt a further blow when a local election favoured candidates opposed to having the base dumped on their town. But stirrings of anti-Japanese protests in China would be a good opportunity to remind the Japanese how useful their friendship with America remains, says Takashi Inoguchi, a Japanese political scientist.
Businessmen like Mr Sankai say the most pressing attribute Mr Kan needs to bring to his job is decisiveness. ""Leaders may gather the opinions of many people but ultimately it's the person at the top who decides,"" he says. Mr Kan has not yet shown a decisive streak. These are early days. But there is no bionic suit to help him lift Japan out of its economic and political paralysis.","Naoto Kan survives a leadership challenge but has yet to prove Naoto Kan a leader .

HOW much does loyalty cost in Japan's fractured politics? Perhaps as much as {Yen}2 trillion ($23 billion). News reports suggest that may have been the sum it took to push the yen from {Yen}82.88 per dollar to beyond {Yen}85 when, on September 15th, the authorities unilaterally intervened in foreign-exchange markets for the first time since 2004.
In explaining the surprise move, the finance ministry argued that the surge in the yen to its highest level against the dollar since 1995 was too much volatility for the authorities' liking. There was official talk of a ""defence line"" around {Yen}82. Another selling blitz was not ruled out.
But there was also a political element. One day before, Naoto Kan, the prime minister, had fought off a challenge to his leadership of the ruling Democratic Party--and hence of Japan itself--by Ichiro Ozawa, a feisty operator who had pledged to weaken the yen if elected. As the currency soared uncomfortably high following Mr Kan's victory, intervention was a way of showing to Mr Ozawa's supporters that Mr Kan could be just as decisive.
According to HSBC, Japan has plenty more room to hit the market ""hard, fast and furious"", because the country suffers from deflation and has near-zero interest rates. That means it can benefit from extra liquidity without destabilising the economy. Analysts say the Bank of Japan appears not to have ""sterilised"", or mopped up, the excess funds, as central banks do if worried that intervention will stoke inflation.
However, the action of the Japanese authorities was unsupported by other central banks, which may weaken its effectiveness. Moreover, in reality Japan's currency is much cheaper than it looks in nominal terms, because prices in Japan have been falling for years, whereas in dollar economies they have risen. Other central banks have sound economic reasons for not stepping in on Japan's behalf. 
In Japan, the argument for stopping yen appreciation is partly a psychological one, economists say. Though exporters have complained noisily about the currency, they continue to reap solid profits abroad and the repatriated earnings may help lift the yen. A stronger currency does most damage to confidence about the future: it tends to depress the stockmarket, which dampens exporters' risk appetites. Japan's main stockmarket surged by 2.5% immediately after the official yen sales.
Intervention is a deal with the devil, however. Currency manipulation from a G7 country such as Japan could undermine efforts to persuade China to refrain from artificially cheapening its own currency. Given that Japan's trade with China is bigger than its trade with America, its beggar-thy-neighbour policy might perversely end up beggaring itself.","Exchange - rate manipulation with a political twist

""PERHAPS the next generation will be wiser than us and find a way of actually resolving this problem."" China's then leader, Deng Xiaoping, who said this in 1978, has been proven wrong about his country's dispute with Japan over the Senkaku Islands, known in China as the Diaoyu. In recent days tensions have risen to a point where China's leaders refuse even to meet their Japanese counterparts and are threatening worse to come. 
China's response to Japan's arrest on September 7th of a Chinese fishing crew near the disputed islands has exposed a dangerous source of instability in the relationship. Far from putting the dispute to one side, as Deng urged, China is escalating it into a full-blown diplomatic stand-off. It has suspended official exchanges with Japan at the level of government minister or above, including provincial leaders. The prime minister, Wen Jiabao, is unlikely even to meet his Japanese counterpart, Naoto Kan, in the sidelines of a United Nations gathering attended by both men in New York this week. A Chinese spokeswoman said the atmosphere was ""not suitable"". 
In New York, Mr Wen has repeated China's calls for the release of the crew's captain, Zhan Qixiong, ""immediately and unconditionally"". He gave warning of unspecified ""further actions"" if Japan does not comply. Mr Zhan's 14 fellow fishermen were allowed home on September 13th, but Japanese authorities are still considering whether or not to press charges against Mr Zhan for allegedly bashing his boat into two Japanese patrol craft near the edge of Japan's territorial waters. Prosecutors must reach their decision by September 29th. 
China maintains that the uninhabited islands were seized by Japan when it took over Taiwan at the end of a war between the two countries in 1895. Taiwan was handed back to China at the end of the second world war, but the islands remained under the control of the Americans, who administered them as part of the Okinawa island chain. America handed Okinawa back to Japan in 1972, including the Senkakus. Japan says the islands have always been Japanese. America takes no position on the rival sovereignty claims. But it has said that its defence treaty with Japan applies to the islands. 
Japan's alliance with America and its own considerable military muscle make it highly unlikely China would risk armed conflict over the islands. But China has allowed its wrath to go far beyond the diplomatic realm. It has suspended talks on the joint exploration of gasfields in the East China Sea as well as over increased flights between the two countries. It has cancelled a Chinese government-sponsored visit by 1,000 young Japanese people to the World Expo in Shanghai (again citing an inappropriate atmosphere). 
One card that China has avoided playing--much to Japan's relief--is encouraging its citizens to take to the streets in protest. During a big spat between the two countries in 2005, thousands of Chinese took part in sometimes unruly demonstrations that appeared at first to enjoy tacit government backing. Japanese officials feared that similar unrest might break out on September 18th, the anniversary of an incident in 1931 that led to Japan's occupation of north-east China. Scattered protests did take place, but they were tiny, peaceful and heavily policed. China seems anxious to discourage any larger display. 
Mr Kan could still intervene to avoid a trial that might inflame public opinion in China. In 2004 Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, did so when a group of Chinese activists landed on one of the islands (he simply had them deported). One way out of the imbroglio, suggests a Japanese diplomat, might be for the government to ask prosecutors to impose a nominal fine on the captain and release him. 
Even if popular nationalism in China so far appears in check (except online), there are concerns in Asia that China's leadership is becoming more assertive over its far-flung maritime interests. In recent months Chinese officials have complained bitterly about American military exercises in the Yellow Sea and asserted that China's claims to the South China Sea are a core national interest. A stronger China is becoming less heedful of Deng's strategy of caution.

China's overreaction to a Japanese ""provocation"" has set its regional diplomacy back years
WHEN he woke up in Lilliput, bound by a lattice of slender ligatures, to find dozens of tiny men disporting themselves on his chest, Lemuel Gulliver let out a roar ""so loud that they all ran back in fright"". Another waking giant, China, seems these days to be adopting a similar foreign policy. It has found it just as effective. But as Gulliver discovered, it has its drawbacks.
The loudest roar has been aimed at Japan. After a Chinese trawler on September 7th rammed two of its coastguard vessels in waters off the disputed, Japanese-administered, islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, Japan detained the captain for a fortnight. China's reaction was, in the words of Seiji Maehara, Japan's foreign minister, ""fairly hysterical"". And Mr Maehara saw signs of Chinese pressure ""in various places"". 
Indeed, as Chinese officials issued dire warnings of unspecified consequences if their skipper were not freed, some odd things started happening. Sino-Japanese trade was held up by unusually thorough customs inspections. Exports of rare earths were subject to an unannounced weeklong ban (
). And it was hard to see the detention of four Japanese construction-company employees on mysterious charges of photographing military facilities as mere coincidence.
Japan seemed to take fright. On September 24th local prosecutors freed the captain. Bizarrely, they cited the importance of relations with China, as if the foreign ministry had subcontracted its diplomatic responsibilities to a low level of the judiciary. China refused to be mollified, insisting it was owed an apology and compensation. Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, smarting from criticism for the climb-down, demanded that China pay for the repair of the damaged boats. But after the initial exchange of indignation, tempers seemed to cool (and China released three of the four Japanese detainees). Just as well. A crowded calendar of multilateral talkfests looms. After the Asia-Europe meeting in Brussels on October 4th come, in a few weeks, the G20, East Asian and Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summits. It would be embarrassing if all were dominated by speculation about whether the Chinese and Japanese leaders shake hands.
As diplomatic trials of strength go, this one seems fairly easy to score: China 1, Japan 0. Mr Kan's administration has appeared unco-ordinated, confused and weak. It has made a mockery of the idea of judicial independence, and managed to make China seem to have greater respect for legal process. China, on the other hand, has forcibly demonstrated that it regards the islands as its own, despite Japan's control of them, and has shown that it has the commercial and diplomatic clout to make its point.
The message was heard elsewhere. Members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), alarmed by China's vague, unexplained but sweeping claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, encouraged America to involve itself in the issue. In July Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, obliged. She told a regional forum in Hanoi that the sea was an American national interest, and made an oblique rallying-call to unity among China's various rival claimants for bits of the sea. 
A mild iteration of this was included in a draft of the joint statement to be issued after the second America-ASEAN summit--held by President Barack Obama in New York on September 24th. The draft deplored the ""use or threat of force by any claimant attempting to enforce disputed claims"" in the sea--ie, it was a warning to China. When the statement emerged, however, cooler heads in ASEAN prevailed. It avoided mention of the sea at all, merely reaffirming ""the importance of regional peace and stability, maritime security, unimpeded commerce, and freedom of navigation"". Also motherhood and apple pie.
India, too, has been watching carefully. Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, has voiced concern about China's maritime ambitions. His government has been worried by China's provocative refusal to give a proper visa to an Indian general, apparently because he served in a ""disputed"" region, Kashmir. China has in the past couple of years seemed eager to prod the two countries' huge but dormant territorial quarrels--over what India thinks of as Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh--back into life.
As a vigorous rising power, China is predictably prickly about its sovereignty. But it must be debatable whether its ""victory"" over Japan has really furthered its own interests. As Japan's Mr Maehara puts it, its behaviour over the disputed islands gave ""quite a few countries a glimpse of the essence of China"". It is fair to guess they did not entirely like what they saw. China sneezes, Asia shivers
To list some of the effects of China's fierce--almost bellicose--reaction: forcing America to confirm that its security treaty with Japan covers conflict over the disputed islands; concentrating Japanese minds on seeking other sources of raw materials such as rare earths; and pushing South-East Asian countries closer to America. As China's own officials might say: it picked up a rock only to drop it on its own feet.
Japanese officials see this in terms of the growing clout of China's armed forces, a power struggle ahead of the transfer of leadership to a new generation at the next Communist Party congress in 2012 and the search for something (such as nationalism) that might give the party a new source of legitimacy. But perhaps such rationalisations miss the point. The second time Gulliver wakes up in Lilliput, it is after passing out, having drunk wine laced with a sleeping-draught. A curious Lilliputian, inspecting his comatose form, puts the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up his nostril. It tickles. Gulliver sneezes violently. Sometimes, awakening giants simply can't help themselves--which was of scant comfort to the Lilliputians.","Economist.com/blogs/banyan 
 China 's overreaction to a Japanese "" provocation "" has set its regional diplomacy back years 
 WHEN he woke up in Lilliput , bound by a lattice of slender ligatures , to find dozens of tiny men disporting themselves on his chest , Lemuel Gulliver let out a roar "" so loud that they all ran back in fright "" . Another waking giant , China , seems these days to be adopting a similar foreign policy . It has found it just as effective . But as Gulliver discovered , it has its drawbacks . 
 The loudest roar has been aimed at Japan . After a Chinese trawler on September 7th rammed two of its coastguard vessels in waters off the disputed , Japanese - administered , islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China , Japan detained the captain for a fortnight . China 's reaction was , in the words of Seiji Maehara , Japan 's foreign minister , "" fairly hysterical "" . And Mr Maehara saw signs of Chinese pressure "" in various places "" . 
 Indeed , as Chinese officials issued dire warnings of unspecified consequences if their skipper were not freed , some odd things started happening . Sino - Japanese trade was held up by unusually thorough customs inspections . Exports of rare earths were subject to an unannounced weeklong ban ( 
 ) . And it was hard to see the detention of four Japanese construction - company employees on mysterious charges of photographing military facilities as mere coincidence . 
 Japan seemed to take fright . On September 24th local prosecutors freed the captain . Bizarrely , they cited the importance of relations with China , as if the foreign ministry had subcontracted its diplomatic responsibilities to a low level of the judiciary . China refused to be mollified , insisting it was owed an apology and compensation . Naoto Kan's , smarting from criticism for the climb - down , demanded that China pay for the repair of the damaged boats . But after the initial exchange of indignation , tempers seemed to cool ( and China released three of the four Japanese detainees ) . Just as well . A crowded calendar of multilateral talkfests looms . After the Asia - Europe meeting in Brussels on October 4th come , in a few weeks , the G20 , East Asian and Asia - Pacific Economic Co - operation summits .

Asians and Europeans both beat up the European Union for its failures in Asia. Give Brussels a break
IF A club is judged by how fast its membership grows, then ASEM, the Asia-Europe Meeting, must be counted a runaway success. Its first summit in Bangkok in 1996 was attended by 25 countries. Its eighth in Brussels this week attracted no fewer than 46, as well as representatives of the European Union and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Size, however, is not everything. Many who took part in the Brussels summit lamented its failure to achieve ASEM's founding goal-- a ""new comprehensive Asia-Europe Partnership"". The consensus was also that this is Europe's fault. Both ideas are questionable.
The charge-sheet of alleged European crimes is a familiar one, albeit rewritten with fresh evidence. There is the arrogance of the EU's lecturing Asia over human rights. There is Europe's failure to grasp that it is in terminal decline and must cede to a thrusting Asia some of the space that European countries occupy in the global institutions set up after the second world war. A test-case discussed in Brussels was European over-representation on the board of the IMF. The offer to share two of Europe's eight seats hardly seemed to grasp this nettle.
Third is Europe's inability to speak with one voice, and the ability of national interest groups to hijack policy. At an EU summit in September, the Europeans agreed to help Pakistan after its recent devastating floods by offering preferential tariffs for its textile exports. But this had to be watered down after objections from France, Italy, Poland and Portugal. 
The reforms set in train by the EU's Lisbon treaty to bring greater coherence to European foreign policy seem to many Asian eyes to have made things worse. They have also given rise to a related complaint, that the EU is too preoccupied with its own internal workings to notice that it is losing friends and failing to influence people. Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean former diplomat who is now dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, put this trenchantly in an article in Time in March: ""Europe just doesn't get it. It does not get how irrelevant it is becoming to the rest of the world."" He blamed ""Europe's obsession with restructuring its internal arrangements"".
It seems odd, then, that one gesture the EU has made towards getting more involved in Asian affairs has been rebuffed. This is its aspiration to join yet another regional talking-shop, the East Asia Summit. This groups the ten members of ASEAN with Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. Russia and America are to join next year. The group has the potential to become one of the more important of the plethora of forums filling the calendars of Asia-Pacific leaders. 
EU membership was at first held up for technical reasons, because one condition was to sign the ""Treaty of Amity and Co-operation"" with ASEAN, something open only to countries, not organisations. That obstacle has been removed. But still ASEAN refused to allow any mention in the closing ASEM chairman's statement even of the EU's aspiration to join. The feeling, apparently, is that the EU has not done enough to deserve the honour.
For the EU's critics, its own summit in September was a good example of its failings. Called ""to give new momentum to the union's external relations"", it was instead overshadowed by a row with France over the expulsion of Roma immigrants. So it combined evidence of both hypocrisy over human rights with the EU's habitual navel-gazing. This belies the summit's conclusions, which aspired to make the EU ""an effective global actor, ready to share in the responsibility for global security and to take the lead in the definition of joint responses to common challenges"". 
""All daydreams, at least for now,"" says Shada Islam of the European Policy Centre, a Brussels think-tank. She agrees with ASEAN that the EU is not ready yet for a seat at the grand-strategy table. But this may not be a fair benchmark by which to measure the state of EU-Asian relations. Trade, its bedrock, is thriving. Between the EU and Asian ASEM members it increased by over 25% in the first half of 2010 compared with the same months in 2009. And China, at least, seems to have decided that Europe and its currency are worth saving, making investments in Spain and in Greece. Stopping in Athens on his way to the ASEM summit, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, promised more support. Yet this may in part be a tactical manoeuvre to deflect criticism from Europe and America over the level of China's currency and, in general, to be nicer to Europe at a time when relations with America and Japan have been rocky. 
China's friend-in-need sympathy to the EU's stricken economies seems in sharp contrast to the harangues to which some of its officials and academics were subjecting the EU just a year ago. But in fact both approaches reflect a desire to see a reasonably cohesive EU as well as a viable euro. Asian expressions of frustration with the EU often seem to betray an impatience with the pace of European integration that ignores the difficulty of the process. It is also the sort of interference in other countries' internal affairs they rail against when directed towards Asia. A meeting too many?
In this context, ASEM, which is often portrayed as a rather desperate measure by Europeans to cling to their vestigial Asian interests, seems more like an Asian drive to engage Europe. It does at least provide a venue for meetings. Naoto Kan, Japan's prime minister, for example, attended in the apparent--and realised--hope of bumping into Mr Wen and beginning to patch up relations. There are plenty of other forums in the coming weeks where they could also have met. ASEM has yet to prove its necessity. But to suggest that relations between Europe and Asia are doing all right and do not need an elaborate, artificial multilateral process is heresy.

AMONG the four-character idioms that all Japanese schoolchildren must learn is kan son min pi (""respect officials, despise the people""). It defines the traditional relationship of individuals as subservient to the state--among whose representatives none is accorded more authority than the public prosecutor. The great privilege this confers on the role, however, can lead to its abuse.
A run of recent legal scandals, including wrongful convictions and brutal incarcerations, has tested respect for Japan's criminal-justice system. The latest example, alleged evidence-tampering by a high-flying prosecutor and a cover-up by his bosses, has rallied many who want to see more regard for individual rights and greater checks on state power. The prosecutor in question, Tsunehiko Maeda, allegedly changed the date of a file on a computer disk that was being used as evidence against a woman accused of involvement in a massive benefit fraud. When Mr Maeda admitted this to his superiors, they are said to have ordered him to produce a report explaining how it happened ""unintentionally"". On October 11th the Supreme Public Prosecutors' Office dismissed Mr Maeda, the chief prosecutor in Osaka's special investigative unit, and pressed charges against him.
The scandal has hit a nerve. Japan takes pride in one of the world's lowest crime rates. But it also has a fishily high conviction rate, at 99.9%. That matches China's and is far above rates in the West (see chart). In their defence, Japanese lawyers say that the country's under-resourced state prosecution service is only able to bring the strongest cases to trial. Fear of failure, with which all Japan's bureaucrats are imbued, reinforces a reticence to test weaker cases in court. According to a former Tokyo district court judge, a single courtroom loss can badly damage a prosecutor's career. A second can end it.
Yet the recent scandals suggest that miscarriages of justice are all too common. So do several quirks of the justice system, which weigh the scales against the accused. Suspects can be held for up to 23 days without charge, for example. They often have little access to a lawyer and none during questioning. Police interrogations commonly last up to ten hours and are rife with mental and verbal abuse. On October 7th a businessman in Osaka produced a surreptitious recording of his seven-hour ""voluntary"" questioning, in which the police threaten to hit him and destroy his life. 
Part of the problem is that Japan has too few lawyers; one tenth the number per head than Britain (see chart, again). That is largely because the government makes it remarkably difficult to become one. For years it set the bar exam pass-rate at around 3%, though it has recently increased it to 25%. This reflects a fear, in a conflict-shy country, that more lawyers will make society more litigious, not more just. 
Recent reforms have improved matters a little. A sort-of jury system, introduced last year, has a panel of six citizens review cases alongside judges, who ultimately pronounce on them. This system produced its first acquittal in June. A more important change, says Kazuko Ito, a lawyer specialising in wrongful-conviction cases, would oblige prosecutors to disclose any mitigating evidence. Former prosecutors also urge judges to be more sceptical about the word of prosecutors and the police. 
In Mr Maeda's shabby case, the court threw out much of the evidence and acquitted the accused. Mr Maeda's supervisors have also been arrested. Now a titillated Japanese public looks forward to prosecuting the prosecutors.","A legal scandal may spark reform of the Japanese judicial system

AMID a flurry of international summitry in Asia, arguments between China and Japan are proving an embarrassment. At a meeting of regional leaders in Hanoi on October 30th, the two countries' prime ministers managed a mere ten minutes of chat. America even offered to help mediate between them--in vain. An angry China is proving unusually hard to placate. 
The diplomatic rupture between Asia's two largest economies began when China responded furiously to Japan's detention of a Chinese fishing-boat crew on September 7th. It has continued far longer than almost anyone expected. The swift release of the crew, and on September 24th of their captain, did little to restore calm.
At a gathering on October 4th of European and Asian leaders in Brussels, China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, spoke in a corridor with his counterpart, Naoto Kan, for 25 minutes. But as with the encounter in Hanoi, no more than the barest of courtesies appear to have been expressed. A more formal meeting did look set for Hanoi, but the Chinese abruptly cancelled it, accusing Japan of acting in ""collusion"" with other countries (for which, read the United States) to inflame the dispute. 
Now China's persistent anger threatens to overshadow a G20 summit in Seoul on November 11th-12th, and a meeting soon after of Asia-Pacific leaders in Yokohama, Japan. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, are due to attend both. Mr Kan hopes to meet Mr Hu in the margins, with no guarantee that Mr Hu will agree, despite a promise by Mr Wen in Brussels that the two leaders could meet ""at an appropriate time"".
In Hanoi, American officials say, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made it clear to both Chinese and Japanese diplomats that she wanted the temperature lowered. Yet her offer of mediation has been tartly rebuffed by China. 
More is involved than mere routine outrage over the arrest of the fishermen off Japanese-controlled islands (the Senkaku islands, or Diaoyu in Chinese) which China claims as its territory. The trawler captain's release could have prompted China to retire, content that Mr Kan's government had been made to look weak despite apparently reckless behaviour on the part of the fishing boat. The Japanese say the skipper was steaming drunk. On November 1st 30-odd Japanese politicians were shown a video they say left no doubt of a deliberate ramming of a Japanese coastguard vessel.
But instead of quietly celebrating Japan's capitulation, China demanded an apology and compensation, which Japan refused. Public opinion in China might be making it difficult for Chinese leaders to climb down. The dispute has triggered the biggest anti-Japanese protests in five years, with thousands taking to the streets in several inland cities.
What is puzzling, however, is that these only erupted on any scale a full three weeks after the captain's release. Perhaps officials tacitly approved of the demonstrations at first. But by the end of October students were being ordered to remain on university campuses over the weekend as some cities tried to prevent further unrest. Similar protests in 2005 also gave the impression of government attempting to put a lid on demonstrations which they had had a role in encouraging.
Michael Yahuda, of the London School of Economics, says China's hard line probably has a lot to do with jockeying for power among Chinese leaders, as sweeping changes to the party and government hierarchy are contemplated for 2012-13. China's foreign ministry may have argued that the rhetoric should be dialled down. But it has never had real clout. The foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, is not even in the Politburo, let alone on the standing committee, pinnacle of Communist Party power. The ministry has found itself further marginalised, as conviction grows within the party that the West is in terminal decline and that it is time for China to assert itself as a global power. Military types privately criticise the foreign ministry for wetness in dealing with Japan and the West.
Recent American behaviour has fuelled the hardliners' belief that the time has come for China to flex some muscle. America has taken to describing freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, most of which China claims as its own, as a ""national interest"". Mrs Clinton repeated this during the East Asia Summit in Hanoi where Mr Kan and Mr Wen briefly met. When she made similar remarks in July the Chinese response was sufficiently furious to unnerve China's South-East Asian neighbours. She earned further rebuke from China (though much praise in Japan) on October 27th, when she emphatically stated that the Senkaku are covered by America's security alliance with Japan.
Mr Obama's tour of Asia from November 5th-14th is likely to reinforce impressions in Beijing that America is stepping up efforts to keep China in check. It takes him to four democracies: India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan. Chinese hawks are particularly worried that America might be trying to cosy up to India in order to contain Chinese power in the region. Elite Reference, a Beijing newspaper, quoted unnamed commentators as saying Mr Obama was deliberately leaving China out of his trip. 
For all that, some leaders worry about China being seen as threatening. For instance, Mr Yang, China's foreign minister, apparently assured Mrs Clinton in Hanoi that China would be a ""responsible supplier"" of rare earths. At the height of the fishing-boat dispute, China stopped exports to Japan of these minerals, which are crucial for the manufacture of many high-technology products. Still, an official in Tokyo says that Japan has not received a single shipment since the captain's release. He also says that the Chinese have even hinted to Japanese manufacturers that if they want rare earths, they should move their factories to China. To the Japanese, that sounds like a menacing invitation to hand over their most valuable technologies--and is anyway a move unlikely to still Chinese anger.","Chinese anger with Japan over a fishing - boat incident is both unexpectedly persistent and uncalibrated 
 AMID a flurry of international summitry in Asia , arguments between China and Japan are proving an embarrassment . At a meeting of regional leaders in Hanoi on October 30th , the two countries ' prime ministers managed a mere ten minutes of chat . America even offered to help mediate between them -- in vain . An angry China is proving unusually hard to placate . 
 The diplomatic rupture between Asia 's two largest economies began when China responded furiously to Japan 's detention of a Chinese fishing - boat crew on September 7th . It has continued far longer than almost anyone expected . The swift release of the crew , and on September 24th of their captain , did little to restore calm . 
 At a gathering on October 4th of European and Asian leaders in Brussels , China 's prime minister , Wen Jiabao , spoke in a corridor with Naoto Kan's for 25 minutes . But as with the encounter in Hanoi , no more than the barest of courtesies appear to have been expressed . A more formal meeting did look set for Hanoi , but the Chinese abruptly cancelled it , accusing Japan of acting in "" collusion "" with other countries ( for which , read the United States ) to inflame the dispute . 
 Now China 's persistent anger threatens to overshadow a G20 summit in Seoul on November 11th-12th , and a meeting soon after of Asia - Pacific leaders in Yokohama , Japan . President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart , Hu Jintao , are due to attend both . Naoto Kan hopes to meet Mr Hu in the margins , with no guarantee that Mr Hu will agree , despite a promise by Naoto Kan in Brussels that the two leaders could meet "" at an appropriate time "" . 
 In Hanoi , American officials say , the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , made it clear to both Chinese and Japanese diplomats that she wanted the temperature lowered . Yet her offer of mediation has been tartly rebuffed by China . 
 More is involved than mere routine outrage over the arrest of the fishermen off Japanese - controlled islands ( the Senkaku islands , or Diaoyu in Chinese ) which China claims as its territory . The trawler captain 's release could have prompted China to retire , content that Naoto Kan's government had been made to look weak despite apparently reckless behaviour on the part of the fishing boat . The Japanese say the skipper was steaming drunk . On November 1st 30 - odd Japanese politicians were shown a video they say left no doubt of a deliberate ramming of a Japanese coastguard vessel . 
 But instead of quietly celebrating Japan 's capitulation , China demanded an apology and compensation , which Japan refused . Public opinion in China might be making it difficult for Chinese leaders to climb down . The dispute has triggered the biggest anti - Japanese protests in five years , with thousands taking to the streets in several inland cities . 
 What is puzzling , however , is that these only erupted on any scale a full three weeks after the captain 's release . Perhaps officials tacitly approved of the demonstrations at first . But by the end of October students were being ordered to remain on university campuses over the weekend as some cities tried to prevent further unrest . Similar protests in 2005 also gave the impression of government attempting to put a lid on demonstrations which they had had a role in encouraging . 
 Michael Yahuda , of the London School of Economics , says China 's hard line probably has a lot to do with jockeying for power among Chinese leaders , as sweeping changes to the party and government hierarchy are contemplated for 2012 - 13 . China 's foreign ministry may have argued that the rhetoric should be dialled down . But it has never had real clout . The foreign minister , Yang Jiechi , is not even in the Politburo , let alone on the standing committee , pinnacle of Communist Party power . The ministry has found itself further marginalised , as conviction grows within the party that the West is in terminal decline and that it is time for China to assert itself as a global power . Military types privately criticise the foreign ministry for wetness in dealing with Japan and the West . 
 Recent American behaviour has fuelled the hardliners ' belief that the time has come for China to flex some muscle . America has taken to describing freedom of navigation in the South China Sea , most of which China claims as its own , as a "" national interest "" . Mrs Clinton repeated this during the East Asia Summit in Hanoi where Naoto Kan and Naoto Kan briefly met . When she made similar remarks in July the Chinese response was sufficiently furious to unnerve China 's South - East Asian neighbours . She earned further rebuke from China ( though much praise in Japan ) on October 27th , when she emphatically stated that the Senkaku are covered by America 's security alliance with Japan . 
 Mr Obama 's tour of Asia from November 5th-14th is likely to reinforce impressions in Beijing that America is stepping up efforts to keep China in check . It takes him to four democracies : India , Indonesia , South Korea and Japan . Chinese hawks are particularly worried that America might be trying to cosy up to India in order to contain Chinese power in the region . Elite Reference , a Beijing newspaper , quoted unnamed commentators as saying Mr Obama was deliberately leaving China out of his trip . 
 For all that , some leaders worry about China being seen as threatening . For instance , Mr Yang , China 's foreign minister , apparently assured Mrs Clinton in Hanoi that China would be a "" responsible supplier "" of rare earths . At the height of the fishing - boat dispute , China stopped exports to Japan of these minerals , which are crucial for the manufacture of many high - technology products . Still , an official in Tokyo says that Japan has not received a single shipment since the captain 's release . He also says that the Chinese have even hinted to Japanese manufacturers that if they want rare earths , they should move their factories to China . To the Japanese , that sounds like a menacing invitation to hand over their most valuable technologies -- and is anyway a move unlikely to still Chinese anger .",740,Japan,A30-187,IN TERM,True,"his counterpart , Naoto Kan ,",6,True

THE southernmost of the Russian-occupied Kurile islands are so close to Japan's northeastern tip that when the fog lifts, there they are. They were, indeed, once part of Japan, which gathered its secret attack on Pearl Harbour in the Kuriles' fastness. But in the days after Japan's surrender in 1945, Soviet forces seized the islands. Thanks to the dispute over what Japan calls its Northern Territories, Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty ending the second world war.
Now, for the second time in two months, Japan to its dismay is getting beaten about by neighbours over lumps of territory. On November 1st President Dmitry Medvedev became the first Russian leader to visit the islands, less than two weeks before he flies to Japan for an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit. To rub in more salt, he posted Twitter snapshots of Kunashiri island and added: ""How many beautiful places there are in Russia!"" Japan temporarily recalled its ambassador to Moscow. Mr Medvedev so loves the place he says he's coming back.
It is now not clear on what terms Mr Kan can meet Mr Medvedev at the summit. An uneasy standoff with both the Russian and Chinese presidents would overshadow Mr Kan's biggest diplomatic shindig since he took office in June. Domestically, the issue can only harm him. Even before Mr Medvedev's photographic jaunt, support for Mr Kan's government had plunged, largely because of foreign-policy failures.
Mr Kan's opponents say that Russian and Chinese assertiveness has been encouraged by strains in Japan's longstanding security alliance with America ever since the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) took office in 2009. These have mostly been over the relocation of a military base on the southern island of Okinawa, an issue still not settled pending an election for governor in late November. It has all left Japan looking rudderless.
The American administration says it is sympathetic to Japan's Northern Territories claims, but that defending them does not fall under the terms of the security alliance. As for that, the outstanding base relocation means that when President Barack Obama and Mr Kan meet next week, they will probably forgo the chance to announce a strengthening of the two countries' alliance on its 50th anniversary.
Some say it is unfair to lay too much blame at the DPJ's door. Hitoshi Tanaka of the Japan Centre for International Exchange says the island incidents simply illustrate a growing geopolitical clout of countries like China and Russia. This week this shifting clout was underscored by a camera-touting tourist on a remote, windswept island.

THE Walkman changed the way people listened to music, especially on the go. Introduced by Sony in 1979, the portable cassette-tape player is finally being discontinued in the Japanese market. The device will remain in production in China and sold in some other places, although Sony will not say how many it still sells or why it bothers to make Walkmans at all in the age of the iPod and smartphone. 
Whoever buys them, the numbers are unlikely to add much to the more than 220m Walkman cassette-players already sold. Yet this pioneering product was almost never made in the first place. Sony's co-founder, Akio Morita, had to battle with his own engineers and executives who argued that a tape-player without a recording function would never work. ""Everybody gave me a hard time,"" Morita wrote in his memoirs in 1986. In the end, though, the boss had his way.
Such determination from a business leader is unlikely in today's Japan. Founder-presidents like Morita, who died in 1999, hold immense power. But their successors, called salaryman-shacho (or ""hired-hand presidents""), do not. This makes it difficult for Japanese bosses to be leaders rather than just figureheads. 
""The salaryman-shacho is one of the biggest reasons why the Japanese economy went down. They don't take responsibility,"" thunders Tadashi Yanai, the founder and boss of Fast Retailing, Japan's largest clothing retailer and operator of the Uniqlo chain of stores. Mr Yanai, who is reckoned to be Japan's richest man, worth around $9 billion, is not alone in his view. Japanese managers lack ""assertiveness, vigour, energy and resolve"", says Kazuo Inamori, the 78-year-old founder of Kyocera, one of the country's biggest producers of electronics parts. 
One problem is that in a consensus-based culture--with the ideal of lifetime employment, and promotions and compensation based more on seniority than performance--few bosses have a free hand, or even an interest, in forging a brash path. Such bosses are implicitly expected to keep things as they are and owe their position to so many internal colleagues that thorough corporate overhauls are almost impossible. Hence, when Toyota needed to take radical steps to rejuvenate the company in 2009, it named the founder's grandson as president, hoping it would put a bold pair of hands on the steering wheel. 
The leadership deficit translates into poor corporate performance. Japanese firms' return on equity has long been less than half that of American and European companies. Since 1996 the number of Japanese companies among the world's leading 50 firms by sales in sectors like manufacturing, retail, banking and health care has fallen by half or more. If the leaders of Japanese firms were able to make just basic improvements--increasing average sales growth from 2% to 5%, lifting earnings from 4.5% to 7% and boosting capital efficiency by 10%--the capitalisation of Japan's sickly stockmarket could triple from its current level, says Bain, a consultancy, in a recent study.
Yet bold leadership is rarely appreciated. In June Naoto Kan, Japan's prime minister, scolded Carlos Ghosn, the boss of the Renault-Nissan alliance, for firing workers--even though Mr Ghosn rescued Nissan from bankruptcy and transformed the company. It also took an outsider to push through change at Sony, where Sir Howard Stringer, a British-born businessman, became boss in 2005. It has taken him years to shoulder stodgy executives aside. This year Sony returned to making money and in the three months to September 30th reported net profits of {Yen}31.1 billion ($385m), having made a net loss of {Yen}26.3 billion a year earlier. Sony needed shaking up. Despite creating the market for portable music with the Walkman, it largely missed the shift to digital music-players.

ANY American president has countless audiences to please when he takes his show on the road. For Barack Obama, on a four-country tour of Asia this week, it was hard to know which mattered most: his hosts, with whom he was trying to build closer partnerships; voters at home who had just given him a shellacking in the mid-terms; or China, the elephant outside the room, with which America more or less openly competes for influence in Asia these days. 
It was chance that the tour took him to Asia's biggest and richest democracies--South Korea and Japan were on the itinerary as hosts, respectively, of the G20 and Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summits. But that lent the tour its tacit theme: that, crudely put, the American model still trumps the Chinese one.
He started in India, where the trickiest job may have been persuading hard-up voters back home that getting closer to the Indian tiger would mean more American jobs created than are being lost to outsourcing. Mr Obama was able to flourish business deals worth $10 billion that he said would ""support"" some 50,000 jobs at home, notably at Boeing. 
As for the bilateral partnership, India presented an unusual challenge. Mr Obama's predecessor, George Bush, was much liked, and he himself viewed with some suspicion. But charming his hosts was easy. The earnest references to Gandhi--frugal, peace-loving, simple--drew wry smiles from India's elite. They relish their country's growing military clout and economic sophistication. 
They did, however, like the concessions Mr Obama brought, such as a partial lifting of limits on high-tech American exports. And they loved his assertion that India is not ""emerging"" but ""emerged"". His diplomatic gift, in a speech to a joint session of parliament, of support for a permanent Indian seat on a reformed United Nations Security Council soon traded at a discount. UN reform efforts, after all, are stalled. But the offer will embarrass China, which has quietly worked to thwart India's ambitions for a permanent seat. China will also be vexed by Mr Obama's encouragement of an Indian role as an East Asian power.
In comparison, Indonesia was a pushover. Mr Obama spent four happy years as a boy in the country. Now, after two cancelled visits, Indonesians still embraced him as one of their own. Mr Obama's affection for the people of the sprawling archipelago seemed heartfelt.
Indeed, he was keen to hold Indonesia up as a model. In a speech to 6,000 cheering Indonesians, he hailed the enormous advances that the country has made, and linked it to the political system. In India Mr Obama had told parliament that the country had succeeded not in spite of but ""because of democracy"". In Jakarta he made the same point about both countries. Prosperity without freedom, he argued, ""is another form of poverty"". 
Both speeches seemed direct rebuttals of the ""Beijing consensus"" in which personal liberty is sacrificed on the altar of economic growth. In both countries, too, Mr Obama lauded traditions of religious tolerance and ethnic diversity. Indonesia has more Muslims than any other country but is a land of many faiths and ethnic groups. Unsurprisingly, Indonesians lapped all this up. As one Western observer put it, the Obama visit provided ""an excuse for Indonesians to relish their own myths"".
More prosaically, the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and Mr Obama signed agreements to deepen the bilateral relationship in the economic, commercial and educational realms, as well as the military one. China went unmentioned. But as South-East Asia's giant, and a member of the G20, Indonesia is now poised to assume a much larger role in the region's emerging security architecture, much of it aimed at coping with China's rise and new assertiveness. 
In Seoul, besides attending the G20 summit, Mr Obama continued his pan-Asian trade mission. But he failed to revive a stalled free-trade agreement with South Korea. American concerns over access for its car and beef exports went unresolved, though Mr Obama said he hoped it would be only a matter of weeks before a deal, at long last.
It had been planned that a free-trade agreement would cap a year of warming relations with South Korea. America was robust in its support after the sinking in March of the Cheonan, a South Korean corvette, allegedly by a North Korean torpedo. The failure to announce a breakthrough may have weakened Mr Obama's message to all his hosts this week that he was committed to reviving American growth through trade. 
From Seoul, President Obama flies to Japan where he will attend the APEC summit in Yokohama on November 13th and 14th and meet Naoto Kan, the prime minister. Much has changed since his state visit to Japan a year ago, when Washington pundits worried that a change of Japanese ruling parties had made America's relationship with Japan trickier than its one with China. Not least, America's relations with China are now decidedly tricky.
Since then Mr Kan's wavering predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, has resigned, and the new administration has revelled in backing from America over Japan's dispute with China over the Senkaku islands (Diaoyu in Chinese). In September Japan seized--and later released--a Chinese boat fishing there after it rammed a Japanese coastguard vessel. But Mr Kan's administration has failed to capitalise on the trawler incident, for instance, in garnering greater support for American troops in Okinawa, a Japanese island close to the Senkakus. Lingering uncertainties over the fate of an American marine base in Okinawa preclude that. Supporting the two countries' agreement to relocate the marine base is still considered a vote-loser in elections for the governorship of Okinawa on November 28th. 
Before he leaves, at least Mr Obama will be spared the traditional indignity of wearing silly clothes for the APEC closing photograph. Japan, which considers a salaryman suit as good as any national costume, is urging leaders to dress smartly, rather than dress up. Afterwards, Mr Obama will visit the great bronze Buddha in Kamakura, which he visited as a child when famously focused more on the matcha ice cream. A prayer for peace and tranquillity might come in handy.","Touring some of Asia 's most successful democracies , Barack Obama has a message for its most successful dictatorship 
 ANY American president has countless audiences to please when he takes his show on the road . For Barack Obama , on a four - country tour of Asia this week , it was hard to know which mattered most : his hosts , with whom he was trying to build closer partnerships ; voters at home who had just given him a shellacking in the mid - terms ; or China , the elephant outside the room , with which America more or less openly competes for influence in Asia these days . 
 It was chance that the tour took him to Asia 's biggest and richest democracies -- South Korea and Naoto Kan were on the itinerary as hosts , respectively , of the G20 and Asia - Pacific Economic Co - operation ( APEC ) summits . But that lent the tour its tacit theme : that , crudely put , the American model still trumps the Chinese one . 
 He started in India , where the trickiest job may have been persuading hard - up voters back home that getting closer to the Indian tiger would mean more American jobs created than are being lost to outsourcing . Mr Obama was able to flourish business deals worth $ 10 billion that he said would "" support "" some 50,000 jobs at home , notably at Boeing . 
 As for the bilateral partnership , India presented an unusual challenge . Mr Obama 's predecessor , George Bush , was much liked , and he himself viewed with some suspicion . But charming his hosts was easy . The earnest references to Gandhi -- frugal , peace - loving , simple -- drew wry smiles from India 's elite . They relish their country 's growing military clout and economic sophistication . 
 They did , however , like the concessions Mr Obama brought , such as a partial lifting of limits on high - tech American exports . And they loved his assertion that India is not "" emerging "" but "" emerged "" . His diplomatic gift , in a speech to a joint session of parliament , of support for a permanent Indian seat on a reformed United Nations Security Council soon traded at a discount . UN reform efforts , after all , are stalled . But the offer will embarrass China , which has quietly worked to thwart India 's ambitions for a permanent seat . China will also be vexed by Mr Obama 's encouragement of an Indian role as an East Asian power . 
 In comparison , Indonesia was a pushover . Mr Obama spent four happy years as a boy in the country . Now , after two cancelled visits , Indonesians still embraced him as one of their own . Mr Obama 's affection for the people of the sprawling archipelago seemed heartfelt . 
 Indeed , he was keen to hold Indonesia up as a model . In a speech to 6,000 cheering Indonesians , he hailed the enormous advances that the country has made , and linked it to the political system . In India Mr Obama had told parliament that the country had succeeded not in spite of but "" because of democracy "" . In Naoto Kan he made the same point about both countries . Prosperity without freedom , he argued , "" is another form of poverty "" . 
 Both speeches seemed direct rebuttals of the "" Beijing consensus "" in which personal liberty is sacrificed on the altar of economic growth . In both countries , too , Mr Obama lauded traditions of religious tolerance and ethnic diversity . Indonesia has more Muslims than any other country but is a land of many faiths and ethnic groups . Unsurprisingly , Indonesians lapped all this up . As one Western observer put it , the Obama visit provided "" an excuse for Indonesians to relish their own myths "" .

FOR a few dizzying moments, Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, looked likely to take his country down the radical path towards freer trade. He and many others have looked on in dismay at Japan's relative decline, measured both in economic terms and in geopolitical influence. Meanwhile, Japan's smaller neighbour, South Korea, has raced ahead in seeking free-trade agreements with its main trading partners, and seen its prestige grow.
Mr Kan attempted to regain the initiative. He wanted, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit he hosts in Yokohama to trumpet the intention to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Currently, the partnership has four members: Brunei, Singapore, New Zealand and Chile. But Australia, Vietnam, the United States and others are queuing up to join.
Yet then the idea fizzled. Not for the first time, the obstacle was Japan's powerful farm lobby, led by Japan Agricultural Co-operatives (JA), along with around 100 parliamentarians from Mr Kan's own Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) who feared losing JA support. On November 9th the government said it would merely begin ""consultations"" with TPP nations, finalising its trade policy around June after producing a farm-reform plan. Mr Kan's idea, in short, has been put out to grass.
Japan's farmers are a protected class, treated twice as generously as Europe's and five times as generously as America's. Tariffs on polished rice are as high as 778%, and on butter reach 482%. Thanks to tariffs and other distortions, Japanese pay twice as much for their food as they should, according to the OECD.
The government has tried to buy off ageing farmers as a precursor to trade talks. It shifted subsidies to income support for individuals, moving away from price supports which distort the market. But it failed to appreciate that whereas farmers receive the payouts, JA often handles the paperwork. Income support cuts out the middleman. So JA quashes reform. Japan's foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, complains that a tiny number of farmers hold the rest of the economy hostage. 
It all marks yet another clumsy climb-down for Mr Kan. A proposal in the summer to double the consumption tax from 5% led to a crushing setback for the DPJ in legislative elections. This month the government said it might keep a white-elephant dam project that it had long promised to scrap. The government has bungled the handling of a spat with China over the arrest of a fishing trawler's skipper in contested waters. Mr Kan's popularity ratings, already abysmal, may now sink further. Three-fifths of those polled by the Yomiuri Shimbun said they favoured the idea of Japan joining the TPP.
Japanese manufacturers are terrified of being shut out of trade deals and handing a huge cost advantage to (chiefly South Korean) rivals. Currently, free-trade pacts cover just 17% of Japan's total trade. In South Korea the share will reach 36% if agreements are implemented with the European Union and America. Meanwhile, a further 26% of South Korean trade comes under free-trade pacts being negotiated. 
For Japan, membership of the TPP would transform the picture. The body commits members to reducing all tariffs to zero within ten years. Even China, which places hefty tariffs on car imports, has signalled an interest in joining. But that is still not spur enough for Japan's establishment to defy the domestic farm lobby.","Japan 's farm sector holds the economy hostage

FOR a glimpse of Japan's future, a good place to visit is Yubari, a former mining town on the northern island of Hokkaido, which four years ago went spectacularly bust with debts of {Yen}36 billion ($315m). It is a quiet spot, nestled in a valley at the end of a railway line. When the coal mines were working 40 years ago, 120,000 people lived there. But the mines have long since closed, and now there are only 11,000 people left, almost half of them over 65. 
The town hall is like a morgue, with few lights on. In the past four years the number of civil servants has been cut in half, their salaries have shrunk by a third and they now have to mop their own floors, they complain. The town has embarked on an 18-year austerity drive to repay its debts. The public library has already closed down. This autumn six primary schools merged into one.
Even so the townspeople look anything but defeated. A group of 80-year-olds chatting in one cafe is the backbone of the local photography club. Delighted to have an audience, they show off black-and-white pictures taken in the 1950s, with children swirling around the school playground on ice skates. 
Like Yubari, Japan is heading into a demographic vortex. It is the fastest-ageing society on Earth and the first big country in history to have started shrinking rapidly from natural causes. Its median age (44) and life expectancy (83) are among the highest and its birth rate (1.4 per woman) is among the lowest anywhere. In the next 40 years its population, currently 127m, is expected to fall by 38m. By 2050 four out of ten Japanese will be over 65. 
Like Yubari, Japan is also deeply in debt. But whereas Yubari's fiscal problems arose from a huge public-spending splurge aimed at wooing back its young people (at one point it had an international film festival and 17 cinemas), Japan at the start of its journey into the demographic unknown already has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world.
Japan is already full of Yubaris. Between 2000 and 2005 the number of people living in small towns and villages across Japan fell by 10m. Only shimmering cities like Tokyo continue to swell, but even they will start to look old within a few decades. 
What matters most for Japan's economic growth prospects is the decline in its working-age population, those aged 15-64, which has been shrinking since 1996. For about 50 years after the second world war the combination of a fast-growing labour force and the rising productivity of its famously industrious workers created a growth miracle. Within two generations the number of people of working age increased by 37m and Japan went from ruins to the world's second-largest economy.
In the next 40 years that process will go into reverse (see chart 1, next page). The working-age population will shrink so quickly that by 2050 it will be smaller than it was in 1950. Unless Japan's productivity rises faster than its workforce declines, which seems unlikely, its economy will shrink. This year it was overtaken by China in size. 
The impact will become even clearer in 2012 when the first members of the 1947-49 baby-boom generation hit 65. From then on, some believe, demography will seriously aggravate Japan's other D-words--debt, deficits and deflation. Unless the retirement age rises in lockstep with life expectancy, ageing will automatically push up pension costs, further straining public finances. Shigesato Takahashi, a senior government demographer, says it will ""rock the foundations"" of Japan's social-security system. It may also entrench deflation. A shortage of workers might push up wage costs, but companies will be loth to invest in new factories. 
This will make Japan a test case of how big countries across the world should handle ageing and population decline. Western Europe's working-age population is already shrinking, though not as fast as Japan's. East Asia, too, will watch Japan intently. Its industrial-growth model has closely resembled Japan's in its post-war boom, rising on the same tide of an expanding workforce and export-led productivity gains. Japan has been called the lead goose in that V-formation. For now, as Florian Coulmas, a population expert at Tokyo's German Institute for Japanese Studies, puts it, Japan is ""the oldest goose"". But South Korea's and China's working-age populations too will soon start to shrink.
One of the unfortunate side-effects of ageing in Japan is that it will be the young who suffer the most. Although unemployment levels may remain among the lowest in the rich world, many of the jobs will be lowly ones. The children of the baby-boomers are currently entering their 40s, which creates a secondary bulge at the middle-manager level of Japanese business. Because of a seniority-based pay system, this puts a huge strain on business costs, leaving less money to provide young people with training and good jobs. 
It is sometimes said that Japan's risk appetite mirrors that of its baby-boomers. In the prime of their working lives they wanted to conquer the world with their products. Now, in their 60s, they want a quieter life. The same seems to go for the country as a whole.
Yet to support them in their retirement, and provide the generations that follow them with the economic opportunities they need, Japan cannot afford to drift. When there is no ambulance to answer a pensioner's anguished telephone call, as sometimes happens in Yubari, the consequences become all too clear. When couples find they cannot afford to care for a bedbound parent, let alone a young child, demography becomes a social disaster. Sirens wailing
This special report will argue that Japan must tackle this issue head on. It needs a grand plan for an ageing population. ""From a business standpoint, right now the threat [of ageing] overwhelms the opportunity,"" says Yoshiaki Fujimori, head of GE in Japan. ""Most people are aware of it, but they don't know how to cope with it."" Boosting productivity to counter the effects of a shrinking workforce will require a cultural revolution, especially in business. Embracing the markets opening up in Asia will mean overcoming 150 years of mistrust of Asia (heartily reciprocated).
There are two reasons for guarded optimism, though. One is that, unlike a lot of rich countries, Japan has not forsaken its industrial heritage. It has a cohesive workforce and it can still come up with innovative products.
The other reason for hope is political. Japan made a huge bid for fresh thinking last year when it ended the one-party rule that had, in effect, been in place since 1955. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) that won the 2009 election, now led by Naoto Kan, has bungled much of its first year in office, but its victory alone was a clear indication of voters' growing impatience with politics as usual. Now the party will need to show that it can deliver.","Japan is ageing faster than any country in history , with vast consequences for its economy and society .

MANY Japanese businessmen will tell you that the biggest problem afflicting their country is lack of political leadership. In the past 20 years there have been no fewer than 14 prime ministers, most of them forgettable. If governments whose tenure has averaged a year and a half have been unable to tackle pressing problems like deflation and stagnation, it is no wonder they have steered away from slower-burning issues such as demography. According to Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Gakushuin University, the entire political class is ducking the issue, not least because ageing citizens constitute such a powerful voting block. ""The generational issues are evaded by all political parties. They remain unconsciously wedded to 20th-century demography,"" he says.
Yet lately politics has started to look a bit more promising. In September 2009 the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to power after a landslide election victory. Voters threw out the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that had governed Japan with barely a break from 1955 to 2009, ending a de-facto one-party system. 
The DPJ's chosen prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, badly fluffed the party's first nine months in office, but hopes picked up in June when Naoto Kan took his place. After a run of four consecutive prime ministers whose father or grandfather had held the same job in the past, Mr Kan was the first without political connections in the family. A former patent lawyer and son of a salaryman, he also represents the growing influence of middle-aged urban voters increasingly prevailing over ageing rural ones who had been among the LDP's core supporters. The porridge party
At 64 Mr Kan can hardly be called the face of young Japan, but his government appears to reflect a long-overdue generational shift in Japanese politics. That shift was vividly shown up in the DPJ's internal election in September when a wily old fox, Ichiro Ozawa, who heads the biggest faction among the party's MPs, sought to unseat Mr Kan but was decisively rejected by the DPJ's rank and file. 
It is not easy to make ideological sense of the DPJ, a loose confederation of interest groups with ideas ranging from fiscal conservatism to Fabian-style socialism, pro-Americanism to China-hugging. Its most popular policy since coming to power has been to hold televised hearings on cutting government waste. Yet it has made little headway on its promise to reduce the power of bureaucrats, especially in ministries such as agriculture, health, education and justice. 
Some of its politicians are economic liberals but felt obliged to attack the pro-market policies of Junichiro Koizumi, the LDP's most reform-minded recent prime minister, when his legacy became bitterly unpopular during the financial crisis of 2008. Mr Kan talks of a ""third approach"" to economic policy, not exactly echoing the ""third way"" of Britain's Tony Blair but with a strong emphasis on improving social safety nets to help ease the potential pain of vigorous pro-growth policies.
Yet underlying this apparent confusion of ideas is a liberal trend struggling to emerge, says Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University. ""The DPJ believes in a society that is less conformist and less risk-averse. The LDP tried to control society through the bureaucrats.""
Haruko Satoh, another academic, thinks the change reflects the emergence of ""popular sovereignty"" in Japan. She notes that voter turnout in the elections of 2005 and 2009 was higher than during the 1990s as people sought to overturn the old system. This may bring more legitimacy to politics, she argues: ""Democratic participation is replacing quiescent obedience.""
Something similar seems to be happening in regional politics, too, which remains staggeringly dependent on federal largesse; by some estimates, 80% of spending in the 47 prefectures is ordered by the central government. In 2008 reform-minded prefectural governors from several parties formed a group called Sentaku, aimed at reducing interference from Tokyo bureaucrats. In Osaka, Japan's second most populous region, the governor, Toru Hashimoto, aims to merge the city and the prefecture to give it Tokyo-like economic clout. In a bid to get round his recalcitrant assembly members, he has also formed a political party that he hopes will thrive on his personal popularity with voters. 
In the car-manufacturing city of Nagoya, Takashi Kawamura, a mayor with a taste for tropical shirts, enjoys strong popularity for trying to halve assembly-members' salaries to pay for a city tax cut. Citizens have called for a referendum that may lead to the assembly's abolition. Mr Kawamura has also helped establish a local political party to fight for the tax cuts. ""If people stand up, they can change society. This is the miracle of democracy,"" he says.
Both these politicians have cast themselves as crusaders, to good effect. But that has not happened at the national level. Mr Kan and his crew come across as earnest rather than electrifying. There is still a dearth of leadership.
Whenever Mr Kan was doing well in the opinion polls since taking office, his government has quickly squandered the advantage. On one occasion he carelessly talked about raising consumption taxes before elections to the upper house in July, which could have lasting consequences. Partly as a result, the DPJ lost its upper-house majority. It now faces a ""twisted Diet"", meaning it lacks enough support in both the upper and the lower house to pass and implement legislation on its own. It may be forced to form ad hoc coalitions with the LDP and other parties even to get next year's budget through. Any sign of weakness, and Mr Ozawa may once again take pot shots at Mr Kan.
Against that bleak scenario, some LDP members, such as Yoshimasa Hayashi, hope that the Kan government will scrap its plans to tighten regulation of the labour market and increase child benefits, and instead include some of the LDP's proposals in its budget plans. That, they say, might dissuade the LDP from blocking the DPJ every inch of the way.
Given the political quagmire, economic policy in the next few years is likely to remain a matter of muddling through. Conceivably Mr Kan's government may not last its term, which runs until 2013. Even so, the looming demographic challenges present an opportunity that Mr Kan should seize. The day he took office, he likened his cabinet to a ragtag militia that helped overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate at the start of the Meiji era in the late 19th century. If he can persuade Japanese voters that dramatic change is needed to secure not only their future but their children's and grandchildren's as well, last year's election may start to look like another turning point in Japanese history.
Caption: Can Kan turn the tide?","After decades of churning , Japanese politics has started to move 
 MANY Japanese businessmen will tell you that the biggest problem afflicting their country is lack of political leadership . In the past 20 years there have been no fewer than 14 prime ministers , most of them forgettable . If governments whose tenure has averaged a year and a half have been unable to tackle pressing problems like deflation and stagnation , it is no wonder they have steered away from slower - burning issues such as demography . According to Takeshi Sasaki , a political scientist at Gakushuin University , the entire political class is ducking the issue , not least because ageing citizens constitute such a powerful voting block . "" The generational issues are evaded by all political parties . They remain unconsciously wedded to 20th - century demography , "" he says . 
 Yet lately politics has started to look a bit more promising . In September 2009 the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) swept to power after a landslide election victory . Voters threw out the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) that had governed Japan with barely a break from 1955 to 2009 , ending a de - facto one - party system . 
 The DPJ 's chosen prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , badly fluffed the party 's first nine months in office , but hopes picked up in June when Naoto Kan took his place . After a run of four consecutive prime ministers whose father or grandfather had held the same job in the past , Naoto Kan was the first without political connections in the family . A former patent lawyer and son of a salaryman , Naoto Kan also represents the growing influence of middle - aged urban voters increasingly prevailing over ageing rural ones who had been among the LDP 's core supporters . Naoto Kan can hardly be called the face of young Japan , but Naoto Kan's government appears to reflect a long - overdue generational shift in Japanese politics . That shift was vividly shown up in the DPJ 's internal election in September when a wily old fox , Ichiro Ozawa , who heads the biggest faction among the party 's MPs , sought to unseat Naoto Kan but was decisively rejected by the DPJ 's rank and file . 
 It is not easy to make ideological sense of the DPJ , a loose confederation of interest groups with ideas ranging from fiscal conservatism to Fabian - style socialism , pro - Americanism to China - hugging . Its most popular policy since coming to power has been to hold televised hearings on cutting government waste . Yet it has made little headway on its promise to reduce the power of bureaucrats , especially in ministries such as agriculture , health , education and justice . 
 Some of its politicians are economic liberals but felt obliged to attack the pro - market policies of Junichiro Koizumi , the LDP 's most reform - minded recent prime minister , when his legacy became bitterly unpopular during the financial crisis of 2008 . Naoto Kan talks of a "" third approach "" to economic policy , not exactly echoing the "" third way "" of Britain 's Tony Blair but with a strong emphasis on improving social safety nets to help ease the potential pain of vigorous pro - growth policies .

THE oldest company in the world is Kongo Gumi, a construction firm based in Osaka. It started building Buddhist shrines in 578AD, and was still run by a man surnamed Kongo 40 generations later. The next four firms by age are also Japanese. According to Yasuchika Hasegawa, chief executive of Takeda Pharmaceuticals (founded in 1781), more than 20,000 Japanese firms are at least 100 years old. 
This has many merits in a world where most firms come and go. No one wants to see Japan's industrial heirlooms vanish. But too many businesses are surviving because credit costs nothing, and bankers care little whether their borrowers are profitable or not. That has two damaging consequences: it ossifies corporate culture, and it drags down productivity. 
According to Mr Feldman at Morgan Stanley MUFG, since the 1990s productivity has been rising by an average of around 1% a year. That is not too bad by rich-world standards, but the trend is downwards, and if it drops much further GDP will turn negative because of the country's demographic drag.
Productivity is poorest in service industries, source of 70% of Japan's output, but an official at METI describes it as ""very weak across the board"". In the domestic market, where two-thirds of output is generated, production per worker in manufacturing is adversely affected by too much competition. That is because companies refuse to consolidate, clinging onto a wide portfolio of businesses, so industries are saturated and profit margins are poor.
In carmaking, for instance, Japan has Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, Mazda and Subaru. South Korea mainly has Hyundai. As a result, says METI, the market per car company in Japan, with a population 2.5 times that of South Korea, is only two-thirds the size of its neighbour's. Moreover, the slowdown in the global car market since 2008 has left Japan with huge overcapacity.
In the service industries, meanwhile, the problem is too little competition rather than too much. Few foreign firms are active in Japan. Myriad construction firms are kept alive by lashings of political pork. The country has 350,000 wholesalers, many of whom just sell to each other, and most make only just enough to keep going. Many of the 1m retail outfits serve as tax dodges for pensioners who sell a few items of stationery or snacks from their front room. They rarely go bust because they have no overheads, and stop only when the owners are too old to carry on.
Both manufacturing and services suffer from head-in-the-sand attitudes in the finance industry. Banks are sitting on huge amounts of money because of the high stock of savings, but they mostly put it into ultra-safe Japanese government bonds. A senior executive at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFj (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, describes this as a ""public mission"" to help sustain public finances. After lending mishaps in Latin America in the 1970s his bank has an abiding desire to be cautious. ""We've existed for 130 years. Prudence has really helped us to become a survivor.""
The upshot, however, is a disturbing lack of risk capital--not to mention vision. Bankers say their customers have little appetite for loans, but a third of those in the system are made by government entities, which may crowd out the private sector. One-quarter of the nation's household assets sit in the postal system, which has been beset by on-off privatisation plans.
According to Naomi Fink of the banking arm of MUFG, much of the liquidity available is in the form of inter-company loans, meaning that big firms keep their suppliers afloat. That seems to be the mission of the finance industry as a whole: to keep everyone afloat. It is not hard to do when money is so cheap. But given the lack of growth in the Japanese economy over the past 20 years, it suggests that many companies are on life support.
Japan's big banks could make more money if they were sufficiently bold and outward-looking to enter foreign credit markets and fund the expansion of Japanese firms abroad, where there are many more growth opportunities. Hiroshi Watanabe, head of the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC), the government agency that increasingly funds overseas projects, laments that ""the megabanks are still very cautious about lending in foreign currencies. They feel comfortable getting money in yen but they don't know how to raise it abroad."" 
Naoto Kan's new government appears to have grasped the importance of productivity. It has introduced a ten-year strategy that seems to be aiming for the best of all worlds--a strong economy, strong public finances, a strong welfare system--but its priority is growth. ""We need to revive an energetic Japan,"" Mr Kan said at his inaugural news conference in June. 
The growth targets--3% a year in nominal, 2% in real terms by 2020--may be based more on hope than experience, but the diagnosis of the industrial problems is refreshingly clear-eyed. METI says Japan's dependence on the car industry, which generated half of all GDP growth from 2000-07, is unsustainable. It also points to Japan's uncompetitive tax system. Big firms pay around twice as much as their South Korean rivals in absolute terms, yet tax revenues are notoriously weak. The government plans to lower corporate tax rates in order to boost competitiveness.
But is its solution the right one? It believes it must actively support industries with strong global growth potential, such as clean energy, because everyone else is doing it. But by ""picking winners"", it risks a huge misallocation of resources if it makes the wrong choice. 
At least there is broad agreement between the government and Japanese business about which industries deserve the most support. Japanese car firms and battery-technology companies are already well placed to create low-energy products: CO2 emissions per unit of GDP are half those in America, and brands like the hybrid Prius have become household names. ""We were behind in the IT revolution. The green revolution is a competition we cannot lose,"" says the METI official. Japan inside
The government also wants to develop medium-sized firms with very high-tech products that form the basis of future devices. Like ""Intel inside"", the logo the chip company puts on computers, products could carry a ""Japan inside"" badge of quality, METI muses.
Given Japan's broad manufacturing base, one big opportunity could be to develop cross-industry partnerships involving, say, water, nuclear power or railways that tap into the need for infrastructure development in emerging markets. Mr Watanabe of JBIC points to the example of harnessing solar or wind power with battery recharging. It is not the same type of connectivity that produced Facebook and Twitter, but it would have its uses.
Boosting productivity, however, is not just about finding the industrial darlings of tomorrow. It is also about weeding out today's second-raters so that profitable new businesses can spring up instead. To make that happen, Japan needs to do more to open up to foreign competition by forging free-trade agreements (FTAs). Japan has a handful with smaller economies like Mexico, Chile and Singapore, and has an economic partnership with the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Meanwhile its ambitious rival, South Korea, has signed FTAs with the European Union and others, and is restarting talks with America. Negotiation of such treaties has been held up by Japan's powerful farm lobby--even though farming accounts for just 2% of GDP. Everyone else is paying a huge opportunity cost to protect those farmers. 
What Japan needs most of all is a huge boost to its domestic economy, which is still its greatest source of demand. There are many ideas for achieving this, such as reviving its housing industry by getting it to build properties suitable for an ageing population, and beefing up its health-care sector. The finance industry too should be finding ways to encourage the elderly to do something constructive with some of their {Yen}1,500 trillion savings hoard. But that would require improvements in Japan's social-security system, which delivers inadequate pensions and offers weak safety nets for those who lose their jobs.","To boost productivity at home , Japan needs to kill off some of its old , unprofitable companies

WALK into the inn in the Hokkaido village of Akanko, and everything from the welcoming cry of ""irasshaimase"" to the taciturn old man grilling chicken on the fire seems quintessentially Japanese. Until, that is, you hear all the customers speaking Mandarin. The Chinese have flocked to this area since it provided some of the settings for a 2008 Chinese blockbuster comedy, ""If You Are The One"". 
The local Japanese were shocked when the early arrivals used the onsen, or spas, to do the unthinkable: they washed their dirty clothes in the hot tubs. There is still some tut-tutting about Chinese customs--the elbows on the table, the lack of familiarity with flushing loos--but if it were not for these visitors, the tourist trade in the area would be half-dead. Before the Chinese fly out of Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital, they splurge on items like medicines and rice cookers. Tourism officials call it the ""Hokkaido boom"".
Japan is a country with immaculate service, good food, beautiful countryside and excellent beaches. As the domestic population shrinks and regional economies suffer, it makes sense to encourage increasingly affluent visitors from other parts of Asia. The Japan Tourism Agency (JTA) has at last understood this. It has set a goal of attracting 10m tourists this year, a big leap from last year's figure of 6.8m. To make this possible it has relaxed its stringent visa requirements, which used to allow in only the wealthiest Chinese. Figures up to September showed a 56% rise in tourist arrivals from China, a degree of success that has caught the Japanese off-guard.
However, in late September the JTA's plans went awry when the arrest of a Chinese trawlerman, fishing in what Japan considers its own waters, triggered the worst diplomatic incident between the two countries in half a decade. China loudly reasserted its rights to the disputed islands, administered by Japan, which the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands but which in China are known as the Diaoyu Islands. China cancelled diplomatic and cultural exchanges. When Japanese officials discovered that imports of rare earths from China, vital for some of Japan's technologies, were being held up, the fisherman was abruptly sent home. But not before all but five of 61 Chinese tour groups that had booked to visit a spa near Mount Fuji had cancelled their reservations. 
Japan still carries a lot of old diplomatic baggage in Asia. It has festering territorial disputes not only with China but also with South and North Korea, Taiwan and Russia. Japanese history books sometimes disagree with those of its neighbours, and Japan's apologies for its treatment of them during the second world war have not fully allayed their suspicions. Many in Japan seem to believe that the war started with Pearl Harbour and ended with atomic bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But for many Chinese, hostilities started in 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, and for South Korea 100 years ago with its annexation by Japan. Uncle Sam's umbrella
Japan was able to turn its back on Asia for most of the post-war period because of a strong security alliance with America that has now been going for 50 years. In its neighbours' eyes, that helped avert the risk of resurgent Japanese militarism. It also meant that Japan was able to keep its defence spending at less than 1% of GDP, enabling it to concentrate more resources on becoming an industrial power. But Asia's rise since the end of the cold war has complicated Japan's external relations. 
When the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to power in 2009, ending 54 years of virtual one-party rule, one of its most controversial policy platforms was to establish a friendship with China that balanced the close post-war relationship with America--one of the hallmarks of the Liberal Democratic Party's rule. The DPJ's leaders dispatched hundreds of its MPs to pay court to Beijing. In a sign of its economic ambitions, the government later appointed a former captain of industry as its ambassador to China.
But the strategy was quickly blown off course, initially by a row with America. This was caused by a rash promise made by the DPJ's first prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to the people of the island of Okinawa to scrap an agreement to move America's Futenma marine base from a crowded town to a more remote part of the island. Many locals resent the American bases, so they welcomed Mr Hatoyama's pledge to reduce the burden on the island. But he failed to find a better alternative, so when last May he was forced to proceed with the move more or less as planned, it cost him his job. All this meant that foreign policy in the DPJ's first year in office focused mainly on the strained relationship with America. Pro-American countries in Asia, such as South Korea, reacted nervously to the potential threat to a security alliance that has helped preserve peace in the region for decades and acts as a counterweight to a strong China. 
Naoto Kan's government has reaffirmed its support for the alliance with America. But the Senkaku incident renewed fears within the Japanese government that China's rise--and especially its massive military spending--is a threat to Japan. DPJ politicians in the party's ""realist"" faction think that China must be made to understand that it cannot rattle its sabre with impunity. Others in the DPJ firmly believe in Japan's pacifist constitution. Others still insist that Japan can become increasingly independent of America's security umbrella, perhaps by building up its own forces, but at the same time remain doveish towards China.
Seiji Maehara, the new foreign minister in Mr Kan's government, is on the party's realist wing. He is convinced that if economic relations between the two countries were to cool it would be bad for both of them. But he adds: ""I'm neither a shallow-minded rightist nor a nationalist. I'm a realist who believes in a win-win relationship with China.""
That is where the relationship with America comes in. There was relief in Tokyo when Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, affirmed that the Senkaku Islands were covered by America's security treaty with Japan. Yet the Kan administration may not be able to hold up its side of the Futenma bargain with America. Okinawans still staunchly oppose relocation. 
Japan, in a volatile neighbourhood, is trying to hedge its bets. Yet it is not fully secure in its relationship with either east or west. It needs America's security backing, but its industrial future increasingly depends on East Asia. In theory, the region should provide it with boundless opportunities to offset the decline in its population. METI estimates that within five years there will be more high earners living in other parts of Asia than in Japan itself. China is so big that just the increase in the number of cars sold there last year was roughly the same as the entire Japanese car market. The business case
But if the opportunities are huge, so are the challenges, and they are not just diplomatic. According to METI's statistics, Japan's sales of intermediate goods to China have tripled in the past decade, but South Korea's have increased by a factor of 11. Over the same period Japan's exports of finished goods to America and Europe have risen by a mere 10%, whereas South Korea's have increased 6.5 times and China's 5.9 times. Japan still has a large trade surplus with South Korea, partly because it sells specialist high-tech components for companies such as Samsung to put into its own devices. South Korea is so bothered by this that its officials keep trying to lure the component-makers away with promises of lower tax rates.
Japanese firms that have expanded into China have sometimes failed to grasp how different it is. They have a lot to offer their neighbour, including an emphasis on quality, trusted products and a strong service culture. They were among the earliest investors in China after the two countries normalised their relations in 1972. Shanghai-based Yasuo Onishi of JETRO, Japan's export-promotion agency, notes that Japanese carmakers, for example, enjoy strong brand recognition, even though some of their cars are too expensive for middle-class Chinese. (The Prius, however, is considered not fancy enough for China's rich.)
Chinese executives complain that Japanese businessmen too often come to lecture them rather than to listen, and that they tend not to promote Chinese managers. There are some honorable exceptions. After a series of strikes this year at companies supplying goods to Toyota and Honda, Komatsu, a maker of heavy machinery, pledged to replace all the Japanese managers at its 16 sites in China with Chinese bosses by 2012. 
Shiseido, a cosmetics-maker, has enjoyed a sevenfold increase in sales to China since 2000, says Shinzo Maeda, its chief executive. It has created brands exclusively for the Chinese market and promotes local talent, albeit with strict Japanese rules on how to serve customers. 
Such companies have a long history in China and are likely to stay the course. But they are still vulnerable to strains in the relationship. After Junichiro Koizumi, prime minister from 2001 to 2006, enraged the Chinese by making repeated visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, which honours some war criminals along with fallen soldiers, it was the business lobby that helped persuade his successor, Shinzo Abe, to break bread with the leaders in Beijing. 
More tourism within the region may help ease some of the misgivings. Culture also plays a role: many young people in Asia were brought up on Japan's J-pop music scene and manga comics. The Japanese, for their part, are wowed by South Korea's girl bands and soap operas.
But there is another thing that some of these Asian countries have in common. South Korea is already getting older fast, and even China's working-age population is forecast to start declining from 2015. If Japan can find a way of dealing with an ageing and falling population, its neighbours will be all ears.
Caption: Japan first","Nearby economies are booming , but Japan 's foreign relations are getting more complicated 
 WALK into the inn in the Hokkaido village of Akanko , and everything from the welcoming cry of "" irasshaimase "" to the taciturn old man grilling chicken on the fire seems quintessentially Japanese . Until , that is , you hear all the customers speaking Mandarin . The Chinese have flocked to this area since it provided some of the settings for a 2008 Chinese blockbuster comedy , "" If You Are The One "" . 
 The local Japanese were shocked when the early arrivals used the onsen , or spas , to do the unthinkable : they washed their dirty clothes in the hot tubs . There is still some tut - tutting about Chinese customs -- the elbows on the table , the lack of familiarity with flushing loos -- but if it were not for these visitors , the tourist trade in the area would be half - dead . Before the Chinese fly out of Sapporo , Hokkaido 's capital , they splurge on items like medicines and rice cookers . Tourism officials call it the "" Hokkaido boom "" . 
 Japan is a country with immaculate service , good food , beautiful countryside and excellent beaches . As the domestic population shrinks and regional economies suffer , it makes sense to encourage increasingly affluent visitors from other parts of Asia . The Japan Tourism Agency ( JTA ) has at last understood this . It has set a goal of attracting 10 m tourists this year , a big leap from last year 's figure of 6.8 m. To make this possible it has relaxed its stringent visa requirements , which used to allow in only the wealthiest Chinese . Figures up to September showed a 56 % rise in tourist arrivals from China , a degree of success that has caught the Japanese off - guard . 
 However , in late September the JTA 's plans went awry when the arrest of a Chinese trawlerman , fishing in what Japan considers its own waters , triggered the worst diplomatic incident between the two countries in half a decade . China loudly reasserted its rights to the disputed islands , administered by Japan , which the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands but which in China are known as the Diaoyu Islands . China cancelled diplomatic and cultural exchanges . When Japanese officials discovered that imports of rare earths from China , vital for some of Japan 's technologies , were being held up , the fisherman was abruptly sent home . But not before all but five of 61 Chinese tour groups that had booked to visit a spa near Mount Fuji had cancelled their reservations . 
 Japan still carries a lot of old diplomatic baggage in Asia . It has festering territorial disputes not only with China but also with South and North Korea , Taiwan and Russia . Japanese history books sometimes disagree with those of its neighbours , and Japan 's apologies for its treatment of them during the second world war have not fully allayed their suspicions . Many in Japan seem to believe that the war started with Pearl Harbour and ended with atomic bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . But for many Chinese , hostilities started in 1931 with Japan 's invasion of Manchuria , and for South Korea 100 years ago with its annexation by Japan . Uncle Sam 's umbrella 
 Japan was able to turn its back on Asia for most of the post - war period because of a strong security alliance with America that has now been going for 50 years . In its neighbours ' eyes , that helped avert the risk of resurgent Japanese militarism . It also meant that Japan was able to keep its defence spending at less than 1 % of GDP , enabling it to concentrate more resources on becoming an industrial power . But Asia 's rise since the end of the cold war has complicated Japan 's external relations . 
 When Naoto Kan swept to power in 2009 , ending 54 years of virtual one - party rule , one of Naoto Kan's most controversial policy platforms was to establish a friendship with China that balanced the close post - war relationship with America -- one of the hallmarks of Naoto Kan's rule . Naoto Kan's leaders dispatched hundreds of Naoto Kan's MPs to pay court to Beijing . In a sign of Naoto Kan's economic ambitions , Naoto Kan later appointed a former captain of industry as Naoto Kan's ambassador to China . 
 But the strategy was quickly blown off course , initially by a row with America . This was caused by a rash promise made by Naoto Kan's first prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , to the people of the island of Okinawa to scrap an agreement to move America 's Futenma marine base from a crowded town to a more remote part of the island . Many locals resent the American bases , so they welcomed Mr Hatoyama 's pledge to reduce the burden on the island . But he failed to find a better alternative , so when last May he was forced to proceed with the move more or less as planned , it cost him his job . All this meant that foreign policy in Naoto Kan's first year in office focused mainly on the strained relationship with America . Pro - American countries in Asia , such as South Korea , reacted nervously to the potential threat to a security alliance that has helped preserve peace in the region for decades and acts as a counterweight to a strong China . 
 Naoto Kan's has reaffirmed Naoto Kan's support for the alliance with America . But the Senkaku incident renewed fears within Naoto Kan that China 's rise -- and especially its massive military spending -- is a threat to Japan . Naoto Kan politicians in Naoto Kan's "" realist "" faction think that China must be made to understand that it can not rattle its sabre with impunity . Others in Naoto Kan firmly believe in Japan 's pacifist constitution . Others still insist that Japan can become increasingly independent of America 's security umbrella , perhaps by building up its own forces , but at the same time remain doveish towards China . 
 Seiji Maehara , the new foreign minister in Naoto Kan's , is on Naoto Kan's realist wing . He is convinced that if economic relations between the two countries were to cool it would be bad for both of them . But he adds : "" I 'm neither a shallow - minded rightist nor a nationalist . I 'm a realist who believes in a win - win relationship with China . "" 
 That is where the relationship with America comes in . There was relief in Tokyo when Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state , affirmed that the Senkaku Islands were covered by America 's security treaty with Japan . Yet the Kan administration may not be able to hold up its side of the Futenma bargain with America . Okinawans still staunchly oppose relocation . 
 Japan , in a volatile neighbourhood , is trying to hedge its bets . Yet it is not fully secure in its relationship with either east or west . It needs America 's security backing , but its industrial future increasingly depends on East Asia . In theory , the region should provide it with boundless opportunities to offset the decline in its population . METI estimates that within five years there will be more high earners living in other parts of Asia than in Japan itself . China is so big that just the increase in the number of cars sold there last year was roughly the same as the entire Japanese car market . The business case 
 But if the opportunities are huge , so are the challenges , and they are not just diplomatic . According to METI 's statistics , Japan 's sales of intermediate goods to China have tripled in the past decade , but South Korea 's have increased by a factor of 11 . Over the same period Japan 's exports of finished goods to America and Europe have risen by a mere 10 % , whereas South Korea 's have increased 6.5 times and China 's 5.9 times .

IN 1979 Ezra Vogel, a Harvard academic, wrote a book entitled ""Japan as Number One: Lessons for America"" in which he portrayed Japan, with its strong economy and cohesive society, as the world's most dynamic industrial nation. Three decades later, Japan holds lessons of a less encouraging sort. Economists in the stricken West have been poring over the data on the deflation that it has suffered since the bursting of the asset-price bubble in 1990. Yet deflation may be just one symptom of an even bigger problem that, as our special report this week argues, is squeezing the life out of the Japanese economy: ageing. Unless Japan takes dramatic steps to re-energise its shrinking, greying workforce, its economy will suffer. 
Other countries face this dismal prospect too. Although Japanese society is growing older faster than anywhere else in the world, plenty of others are shuffling along behind it. Parts of Europe are ageing fast, and are unwilling to adapt, as recent protests against rising retirement ages in France and Greece attest. Other Confucian countries such as South Korea, China and Taiwan, have enjoyed a ""demographic dividend""--a rapidly expanding workforce and falling birth rate--similar to Japan's in the 1960s to 1980s. With fewer children and elderly to pay for, such countries could plough savings back into economic expansion. As in Japan, relatively few women work after becoming mothers and even fewer immigrants are let in. Such places will look to Japan for how to cope with the economic and social consequences when their manpower starts to dry up. So far, they will find, it is ducking the issue. Young at heart
Many in Japan shrug off the problem of ageing. That is partly because the elderly continue to live comfortably on their vast hoard of savings. Even though the number over 65 has doubled in 20 years, Japan's health-care system remains one of the cheapest and best in the rich world. And its economy, though it has now been overtaken in size by China's, remains home to a huge industrial apparatus with the innovative clout to make life easier for its elderly citizens. Anyway, what with entrenched deflation, high debt and disappointing economic growth, the Japanese have had other things to worry about in the past two decades. 
Yet what Japan fails to appreciate is that, as the years pass, its economic ailments are being compounded by skewed demography. Unless the country acts to tackle this, its decline will become intractable--for three reasons.
The crux is in the working-age population, aged 15-64. From a peak of 87m in 1995, it is expected to fall to about 52m by 2050, leaving it close to its level at the end of the second world war. Unless the output of those workers rises fast enough to offset the decline in their numbers, GDP will inevitably shrink; some predict Japan's output will be smaller than Indonesia's by the middle of this century. Declining GDP would not, in itself, be much of a worry, provided that output per person continued to rise. The trouble is that living standards are already dropping compared with other rich countries, so Japan feels poorer. And falling output may weaken Japan's sense of self-confidence and its standing in the world. What is more, Japan has the highest government debt relative to GDP in the rich world. If debt continues to grow as the economy contracts, it will become even harder to bear.
Secondly, a dwindling band of workers will have to support rising social-security payments, as the number of retired people grows. This will strain public finances. Ten years ago each person in retirement was supported by four in work. In ten years that burden will fall on only two workers. Already, the rising cost of caring for the elderly has pushed up the government deficit and the national debt. If Japan's workers cannot shoulder their burden, the country will find itself unable to honour fully its pension and health-care commitments. In effect, it will be forced to default on its obligations to society. 
Thirdly, as the population ages and shrinks, demand will probably weaken. This would lower Japanese firms' appetite for risk and thus their willingness to invest. In growing markets, companies can afford to risk over-investing, because excess capacity is eventually mopped up. But amid shrinking populations, that logic is turned upside-down. Firms not only need to export more or build fewer factories; they may have to destroy idle ones. It is little wonder that Japanese companies hoard so much of their profit. The long-term outlook in their home market--which still accounts for about two-thirds of output--is uncertain. And yet the more they scrimp on investment, the more joblessness, especially among the young, will deepen Japan's sense of malaise.
There are ways to overcome these hurdles--ways that would not only ensure living standards do not slip but also make for a more vibrant, inclusive economy. At present, for instance, 62% of working women quit their jobs after having their first child; less discrimination against them in the workplace would encourage them to go on working. Retired people could be coaxed back to work, especially if they could claim their pensions while working. More immigration could help Japan maintain an innovative streak that it risks losing as its workers age. The hardest task will be to raise Japan's productivity to offset the looming manpower shortage. Deregulation would help, by making it easier to sell services (such as residential care) to the elderly, by freeing up finance to allow them to make better use of their savings, and by encouraging more competition in the domestic economy so that it can withstand the inevitable shocks to external trade. Get up and go
All this means overcoming cultural taboos--especially in Japan's hierarchical companies--which for too long have been an excuse for inaction. It also demands strong political leadership, something that Naoto Kan has yet to supply, despite a clamour for fresh thinking when voters ended almost half a century of one-party rule last year. If Japan tackles its demographic problems swiftly, it has a chance of being a model of how to deal with ageing, rather than a dreadful warning.","The biggest lesson the country may yet teach the world is about the growth-sapping effects of ageing

LESS than six months after plunging popularity finished off the Democratic Party of Japan's (DPJ) first-ever prime minister, the opposition parties are again scenting blood. Naoto Kan, who has been prime minister since June, is vulnerable on many fronts. But his opponents' bluster is not winning them any new followers.
On November 26 and 27th, Mr Kan's cabinet received a taste of the medicine his party used to spoon out when it was in opposition. Two members of the DPJ, including Mr Kan's outspoken chief of staff, were censured in the upper house of parliament for a variety of mishaps, just days after the justice minister was forced to resign for making a joke about his duties. 
In parliamentary terms censure is a symbolic gesture. In Japan it is overused. When the DPJ brought it against prime ministers of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) twice in the 18 months before it took power last year, the embarrassment damaged both parties.
Just over a year later, the LDP, now in opposition, is taking its turn at bat. ""The main focus is to get Mr Kan to resign,"" says Tadamori Oshima, the party's vice-president. ""Unless the DPJ makes a fresh start next year with a new cabinet, it will face political turmoil."" The smaller Your Party, which draws support from urban businessmen, wants to go a step further. It hopes to push the government into calling a general election, says Keiichiro Asao, one of its members of parliament. Yet he admits his party is not strong enough to achieve that end by itself--nor is it on good terms with the LDP.
Both parties have been emboldened as popular support for the Kan administration has plunged. Opinion polls indicate that the government's approval ratings have fallen by at least half since September, when it was seen to have mishandled an incident involving a Chinese trawlerman who had been arrested in waters that Japan claims as its own.
Japan's acquiescence in releasing the fisherman, then leaked footage showing the trawler crashing into the Japanese coastguard and a series of clumsy comments by cabinet members have all made matters worse (and found their way into the censure motions). Even the DPJ's main supporters sound fed up. During a televised meeting on December 1st, Nobuaki Koga, the head of Rengo, Japan's largest trade union confederation, begged Mr Kan to take public opinion more seriously.
Mr Kan's government has been stymied at every turn, but not crushed. It managed to secure implementing legislation for a 5.1 trillion yen ($60 billion) economic package on November 26th, thanks largely to support in the upper house from an opposition party, New Komeito, that appears to be wavering over whether to back Mr Kan or not. 
Mr Kan had a further dash of good news on November 28th when the incumbent governor of Okinawa, an island in southern Japan packed with American military bases, won re-election. Though the governor was not backed by the DPJ and indeed opposes any agreement between Japan and America that would relocate a giant marine base within Okinawa, the government hopes his victory will make it easier to persuade Okinawans that the move should go ahead. 
These are flimsy grounds for optimism, though. Mr Kan's best hope must be that support for the opposition parties is too weak for them to become truly assertive. Opinion polls show that voters, however much they despair of the DPJ, are increasingly turned off by the other parties too.
If Mr Kan were forced into a new general election, analysts say it is likely that neither the DPJ nor the LDP would win an outright majority. This would create more uncertainty. Japan has reason to lament its ""twisted Diet"", in which no party has control of both houses of parliament. But if no party had control of either house, the potential for gridlock would only get worse.","Troubles in Naoto Kan's camp are firming up the flabby opposition

In China the main worry was of an overheating economy. The central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates for the first time in three years amid concerns about inflation. Official trade statistics showed China had overtaken Germany as the world's biggest exporter. Tensions over currency policy were at the forefront during summits of the G20 and IMF. 
Google had a spat with China over censorship and a cyber-attack on its website there, causing it to redirect its Chinese internet searches through Hong Kong. Separately, Google, Facebook and others promised to do more to protect privacy after an outcry about their handling of users' personal data. The year of living dangerously
An earthquake in Haiti was a humanitarian disaster, killing at least 230,000 people and leaving 1m homeless. The quake devastated Port-au-Prince and left swathes of the country's fragile infrastructure in ruins. A deadly outbreak of cholera later in the year and political unrest compounded the misery. 
Drifting ash clouds emanating from a volcano in Iceland led to the closure of European air space for several days, causing the biggest disruption to worldwide air travel since September 11th 2001. 
American combat operations ended in Iraq, seven years after the start of the war. Around 50,000 troops remain in a support role until the end of 2011. Iraq continued to be troubled by violence and suicide-bombs after the Americans departed. An election was held in March, though a new government didn't begin to emerge until November. 
The war in Afghanistan rumbled on. Coalition troops mounted their biggest offensive against the Taliban since 2001. The deaths of civilians in targeted missile attacks aimed at the Taliban and al-Qaeda caused rows. GeneralStanley McChrystal was sacked as commander of coalition forces after a magazine published an interview in which he disparaged the handling of the war by America's civilian leadership. General David Petraeus took charge. 
Pakistan endured another year of severe terrorist attacks, starting on January 1st when a suicide-bomber killed 100 people at a volleyball match. In July, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for huge blasts at a Sufi shrine in Lahore and at a market in the tribal area. Rioting in Karachi after the assassination of a politician killed scores. Relentless flooding from exceptionally heavy monsoon rains affected 20m people, adding to the country's woes. 
Among the year's other deadliest terror attacks were co-ordinated bombings at two crowded bars in Kampala, the Ugandan capital. The Shabab, a Somali Islamist militia, claimed responsibility. The heat is on
A spate of terrorist assaults in Russia, including a suicide-bombing on the Moscow metro, killed scores of people. Chechen separatists were blamed. The hottest summer in Russian history resulted in hundreds of wildfires, causing a public-health crisis in Moscow when smoke enveloped the city. 
A spoof broadcast in Georgia claiming that Russia had invaded the country caused panic. The bulletin, using imagery from the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, prompted people to flee Tbilisi, the capital. 
After months of cajoling, Israel and the Palestinians sat around the table for direct talks, though the negotiations soon broke down over the building of Jewish settlements on the West Bank. The American-Israeli relationship became somewhat strained. 
Israeli intelligence was said to be behind the assassination of a senior Hamas military leader, who was killed at a hotel in Dubai. A diplomatic row ensued when it emerged that the assassins had travelled under the stolen identities of European and Australian citizens. There was another international ruckus when Israeli commandos shot dead nine people on a Turkish ship with humanitarian supplies bound for Gaza. 
The world cheered when all 33 men trapped underground for 69 days at a mine in Chile were brought safely to the surface. But mining accidents in China, Russia, West Virginia, New Zealand and Turkey each killed dozens of workers.
An election in Britain saw Labour booted out of power after 13 years. The Conservatives emerged as the biggest party but without an overall majority. After a few tense days of talks, the Conservatives formed a coalition (the first in Britain since the 1940s) with the Liberal Democrats, who came third at the polls. The new government, led by David Cameron, embarked on a radical programme of spending cuts. Joyful and triumphant
In other big elections, Dilma Rousseff won the presidency in Brazil, the first woman to do so. Julia Gillard became Australia's first female prime minister after ousting Kevin Rudd; she kept the job after a subsequent election. For the first time in 50 years Chile elected a conservative president, Sebastian Pinera. Mahinda Rajapaksa was re-elected as Sri Lanka's president; his opponent was arrested soon after. Benigno Aquino won a presidential election in the Philippines; he is the son of a late president, Corazon ""Cory"" Aquino. And Viktor Yanukovich was elected president of Ukraine, though Yulia Tymoshenko, his opponent, mounted a brief challenge to the result in court. 
Poland's president, Lech Kaczynski, was killed in a plane crash near Smolensk, Russia, along with the head of Poland's central bank, senior diplomats and military leaders. The ensuing presidential election was won by Bronislaw Komorowski, who defeated Mr Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw. 
An explosion at a BP well in the Gulf of Mexico in April killed 11 men and caused the world's biggest civilian oil spill to date, before the wellhead on the sea floor was finally sealed in September. The catastrophe forced a halt to commercial fishing in the area and a moratorium on drilling. The Obama administration faced sustained criticism of its handling of the crisis. BP's share price slumped, wiping out almost half its stockmarket value. In December America launched a lawsuit against BP and other companies potentially liable for the spill for billions of dollars in damages. 
North Korea's increasingly bellicose attitude towards South Korea rattled the world. The sinking of a South Korean navy ship with the loss of 46 sailors was blamed on a torpedo attack by the North. Later in the year the North launched an artillery barrage against a tiny South Korean island. Kim Jong Un, the youngest son of Kim Jong Il, North Korea's ailing Dear Leader, moved up the ranks as heir apparent. 
Naoto Kan became Japan's third prime minister within two years when Yukio Hatoyama resigned after reneging on a promise to remove the American marine base near Okinawa. 
A recall of Toyota vehicles in America amid reportsof sticking accelerator pedals proved to be a public-relations disaster for the carmaker, compelling its boss to apologise at a congressional hearing. 
There was more turmoil in Thailand when red-shirted opposition protesters set up an encampment in central Bangkok. After a two-month stand-off the army moved in to clear the streets; 50 people were killed in the resulting clashes. 
Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest by Myanmar's ruling military junta. She had spent much of the past 20 years in detention and was freed after Myanmar's first national election since 1990. The ballot was rigged to favour the junta's candidates. 
Goodluck Jonathan became president of Nigeria when the ailing and absent Umaru Yar'Adua was deemed too ill to continue in office (he died in May). There was further bloody conflict along ethnic lines between Christians and Muslims near the city of Jos. 
Ethnic rioting in Kyrgyzstan between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in the south of the country displaced hundreds of thousands and threatened to turn into a civil war. The ""hot potato"" effect
Stockmarkets around the world had a bumpy year, none more so than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which plunged dramatically within a matter of minutes on May 6th, only to recover the losses some 20 minutes later. An investigation found that a poorly executed algorithmic trade was at the root of the ""flash crash"". 
Kraft Foods bought Cadbury in a $19 billion takeover, one of the biggest of the year, though the sale was contentious.

Apple started selling the iPad, a computer tablet that looked set to revolutionise digital publishing. Apple overtook Microsoft as the world's biggest technology company. 
Among the year's sporting events, the winter Olympics were hosted by Vancouver, the World Cup was held in South Africa (and won for the first time by Spain) and the Commonwealth games took place in Delhi, though some competitors threatened to pull out because of poor hygienic conditions at the athletes' village. An annual event in England where challengers chase a wheel of cheese down a hill was officially cancelled on health-and-safety grounds.","High levels of public debt among countries in the euro zone turned into a full-blown crisis for the currency block. As markets began to lose confidence in the ability of a few countries to finance their debt, and rapidly pushed up their borrowing costs, the European Union and the IMF eventually resolved to bail out Greece and, later, Ireland. Investors also fretted over Spain and Portugal. Measures to tackle budget deficits were met with protests, especially in Greece, which endured strikes and riots. In France 1m people demonstrated against pension reforms in a single day. 
As Europe tightened its fiscal belt, America passed more stimulus measures. Barack Obama also signed into law the most sweeping changes to America's financial-regulatory system since the 1930s and a health-care reform act that was hailed by many as America's most significant piece of social legislation since the 1960s. Conservatives challenged the act in the courts. 
Unease about deficits and the ""jobless recovery"" were factors behind the increasing clout of tea-partiers in America. With their support the Republicans scored a sensational win in a special election for Ted Kennedy's former Senate seat in Massachusetts.November's mid-term elections saw the Democrats swept from power in the House by the biggest swing to the Republicans in decades.

AT 60, Hiroshi Ikeguchi wryly describes himself as one of the youngest in his district. He has lived his whole life in Irifune, just above the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shipyard. But like his ageing neighbours, the Nagasaki suburb is collapsing around him. A dozen houses have been left to rot after their owners have died. Some are piles of timber; in others, katsura trees grow through the roofs. Outside one is a new year's offering of fruit left by a neighbour who still laments how the death of the ""kind old lady"" who lived there went undiscovered for a week. Peer through the letterbox, and in the gloom you see a calendar pinned to the wall. The date is September 1988.
In Mr Ikeguchi's youth, when Nagasaki was rebuilding itself after nuclear devastation in 1945, the streets near his house rang with the sound of shipwrights walking to the Mitsubishi yard each morning. Now Nagasaki's economy has gone still. The port city's fortunes show how three forces sapping Japan's energies--depopulation, overcentralisation and foreign competition--are hurting not just rural backwaters but once-prosperous cities on Japan's fringe. The phenomenon remains partly hidden. Residents of luxury apartments across the bay complain about Irifune's shabby appearance. If only they knew, Mr Ikeguchi says, how bad it really is.
Nagasaki's troubles are self-reinforcing, argues Takamitsu Sato, president of the Nagasaki Economic Research Institute. Since the 1960s a brain drain has sucked people towards Osaka and Tokyo. Young people who left to find jobs elsewhere never came back. Even now, seven in ten college students leave to study, and over half of young people find jobs elsewhere.
The brain drain reinforces a demographic trend. The prefecture's working-age population has shrunk from over 1m in 1990 to 874,000 in 2008, a result both of the exodus and a declining birth rate. The city of 1.45m is shrinking and ageing so fast that one of Nagasaki's main department stores, Tamaya, has closed down its children's department and stocked up on undergarments and hearing aids. With shrinking investment, and fewer jobs and young families, new house-building has fallen by half in the past ten years.
So now Nagasaki's living standards are falling too, a shock in a country where economists said that individuals could be better off even if the overall economy shrank in size. Mr Sato's institute reckons that if today's trends continue, GDP per person will fall from 3.26m yen ($28,000) in 2007 to 3.14m yen by 2020. Everything, he says, is going downward.
Can Nagasaki pull out of the spiral? Historically, after all, the city is Japan's most open, allowing in Dutch and Chinese merchants in the 17th-19th centuries when foreign trade with the rest of the country was banned. Nagasaki is one of the closest cities to China and South Korea, with opportunities for tourism and trade. The museum to the atom bomb and its victims is world famous. Nagasaki is the birthplace of Japanese Christianity. It was a cradle of insurrection against the last shogunate, helping to shove Japan into the modern age with the Meiji Restoration of 1868.
To reverse the decline, Mr Sato has drawn up a plan with local officials that looks for overseas revenues to make up for falling domestic ones. That is hardly revolutionary. Among the goals are doubling numbers of foreign students, to 3,000; turning the shipyard into a tourist site; and bolstering sales of kamaboko, a rubbery fishcake. But asked about bolder measures such as encouraging foreign investment and skilled immigrants, Mr Sato says there is ""not the right environment"" for that yet.
Meanwhile, Nagasaki's once-mighty shipping industry has been keelhauled by South Korean and Chinese yards with lower costs and quicker thinking. And Mr Ikeguchi says that even modest government initiatives, like demolishing abandoned houses in Irifune to attract newcomers, take years to grind through city hall.
Like the elders of Nagasaki, the prime minister, Naoto Kan, realises that Japan must look abroad since its own markets are shrinking. At the start of 2011, he declared (143 years after the fact, some might say) that this was the ""first year of opening Japan to the outside world"" in the modern era. Nagasaki is a good example of why action needs to be swift and bold.

WHEN the Japanese government revealed a hefty ""new growth strategy"" in June, the response was sceptical. Yomiuri Shimbun, the country's biggest newspaper, relished reporting the ""21 key national strategy projects"" and ""about 330 policy items"" up for change. They ranged from promoting clean energy and overseas infrastructure projects to attracting medical tourists and foreign firms. 
Since then the ruling Democratic Party of Japan has continued to falter. The popularity of the prime minister, Naoto Kan, has sunk as low as 21%, curtailing his ability to push reforms. And the government has placed the most controversial ideas on hold, at least publicly. Yet substantial changes are quietly taking place, a few of which have already borne fruit. 
The most prominent change is in tax policy. Politicians have talked for years about lowering the corporate tax rate, at 40% the highest in the rich world. Companies argue they cannot compete against rivals in countries like South Korea, where the tax is just 24%. Last month Mr Kan promised to slash five percentage points off the tax in the 2011 budget, which goes before parliament in March. 
To encourage overseas companies to set up regional headquarters and research facilities, the trade ministry is also proposing to lower the combined national and local tax on foreign firms to between 20% and 29% for five years. Long accused of giving subtle, preferential treatment to domestic players, Japan is poised to discriminate openly in favour of foreigners. 
The government has stepped up its economic diplomacy, too. Having lost two large nuclear-power contracts in 2009 and 2010 to Russian and South Korean bidders with strong government backing, Japan has put its politicians on the road. This month ministers have hawked high-speed trains in Florida and touted a water-treatment facility in Riyadh. A state-backed lender, the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC), has opened the financing spigot. Such efforts seem to be paying off. Vietnam has said it will turn to Japanese technology for the second phase of its nuclear programme, which is worth about {Yen}1 trillion ($12 billion). Turkey, heavily lobbied by Japan, is in talks to conclude a nuclear-power contract that had been expected to go to South Korea. 
As an aged, technologically advanced country, Japan ought to be a global leader in medical care. On January 7th the government established a department within the Cabinet Office to enhance the competitiveness of Japan's medical business, including research, devices and drugs. It has also created a new six-month medical visa for foreigners and their caregivers that is designed to draw health tourists. 
Overall, the government wants to create 5m new jobs by 2020, rake in {Yen}118 trillion, and bump GDP growth up to more than 3% from its long-term average of 1%. That appears unrealistic. Even after cuts, Japan's corporate taxes are still far higher than in other countries. And it is not clear that the government will have the clout to push through the toughest initiatives, such as joining a regional free-trade agreement. 
Still, the fact that some action has taken place counts as a positive sign. It marks a remarkable maturation for the DPJ, which strode into office 16 months ago clutching a sheaf of anti-business policies such as reversing the privatisation of the post office (the world's biggest bank by deposits), creating a three-year debt moratorium for small firms and introducing unwieldy targets for carbon-emission reduction. But crisis eventually concentrates minds.","Japan 's government is trying to attract business investment . Really

""DO YOU mind if I smoke?"" rasps Kaoru Yosano, 72, a survivor of throat cancer. Mr Yosano is no quitter. At an age when, even in Japan, many politicians bow out, on January 14th he performed a flying trapeze act by joining the government of Naoto Kan, whose Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) he has derided for years.
A year ago, when the DPJ's Yukio Hatoyama was prime minister, Mr Yosano wrote a book called ""The DPJ Destroys Japan's Economy"". But that was before Mr Kan took over with the (for Japan) radical promise of launching debate on raising the consumption (ie, sales) tax, which at 5% is the lowest in the rich world. The promise nearly sank Mr Kan, but it endeared him to Mr Yosano. Now the former finance minister (and grandson of two famous pre-war poets) has become Mr Kan's man on tax and pension reform.
It is a gamble. Mr Yosano's appointment offended many in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that gave him a seat in 2009 out of loyalty (ironically, he had lost his Tokyo constituency to the DPJ's Banri Kaieda, whose job in the cabinet he has just taken). Some LDP members may try to blackball Mr Yosano in the Diet (parliament). He has few natural allies in the DPJ, and does not disguise his differences. At heart he believes, perhaps hopes, the LDP can return to power, if only it reforms itself.
Yet Mr Yosano's appointment is bold, too. Even his critics acknowledge that, in taking the job at his age, he is driven more by principle than glory. He believes in urgent tax reform if fading Japan is to shore up pensions, health-care and child-support systems. Mr Kan, whose party lacks a majority in the upper house, needs more such opposition politicians. Mr Yosano may be a good model.
The new minister is still coy about how much the consumption tax should be raised. Like Mr Kan, he appears to think doubling it would be a start. Opponents say that would derail a fragile recovery. But Mr Yosano says that, on the contrary it would give people confidence about the solvency of the pensions system, which would encourage them to spend. He also believes the markets need reassurance about the health of all public finances, which he describes as ""far worse than in a few of the worst European countries"" (gross debt is twice the size of GDP).
On the timing of a tax rise, opinions in government vary. Koichiro Gemba, Mr Kan's main policy adviser, says a rise in the consumption tax should not be before the next general election, though cross-party talks should start within the next five months, with a tax increase decided by March 2012. Mr Yosano remains non-committal.
In Japan the media and the opposition seize on such differences as evidence of disarray. Yet, with a reshuffled cabinet, the government at last appears to have settled on a message of reform, including of trade and agriculture, that appears refreshingly non-partisan. Among other things, Mr Kan wants a decision by June on whether Japan should begin trade talks, including with America, under the aegis of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade block.
For now, squabbling or even gridlock will mark the Diet at least until the spring. The opposition looks determined to try to block Mr Kan's budget, believing the tactic will score points in prefectural and municipal elections in April. But if Mr Kan can ride that out, with public opinion on his side he may yet persuade opponents to support policies that start dealing with the country's troubled finances. Japan's economy, Mr Yosano once wrote, was infected with a grave cancer. The inveterate smoker is now Mr Kan's chief ally in cutting it out.

TOTTORI prefecture on the Sea of Japan is known for its vast sand dunes and for having the smallest prefectural population in Japan, of which about one in six lives on a farm. In last summer's election for the upper house, its 500,000-odd voters sent one representative to the Diet (parliament). Kanagawa prefecture, a gritty industrial area that borders Tokyo, has more than 7m voters of a much younger average age. Yet its electorate directly voted for just three upper-house seats.
Since the election, high courts up and down Japan have ruled that having a vote in Tottori weigh about five times more than in Kanagawa is unconstitutional or ""in a state of unconstitutionality"". None has nullified the election. But the threat that one day the judiciary might throw Japan's upper house into a constitutional crisis has goaded politicians from all parties to consider overhauling the electoral system for the so-called House of Councillors.
Not only legal reasons argue for reform. On January 24th Naoto Kan, the prime minister, articulated two bold proposals at the opening of the Diet, both of which are likely to be fiercely resisted by over-represented elderly farmers in places like Tottori: overhauling the tax and social-security system, and embarking on talks to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an emerging free-trade block including America. To persuade opposition parties to support a higher consumption tax and the TPP, a cut in the number of costly upper-house seats, from today's 242, may be proposed as part of the electoral reform.
The president of the upper house, Takeo Nishioka, is an unlikely figure to be spearheading the mission. At 74, he feels a bond with the ageing farmers likely to be affected. ""If I think emotionally, I would not propose this."" He adds that throughout his political career, he has felt that the upper house should be not simply reformed but abolished. Yet now that ""destiny"" has put him at its helm, he feels a duty to act.
He intends to submit a bill at the end of this parliament, when he hopes bickering over the 2011 budget and local elections in the spring will be over. It is, he says, potentially the most important reform since the creation of the House of Councillors in 1947. He believes it needs to be ready in 2013, when a general election is due.
Under the current system, voters directly elect candidates in 47 prefectures, and other candidates are selected through proportional representation. Mr Nishioka's proposal (as leader of the house, he says he is non-partisan) is to scrap the prefectural system, and replace it with proportional representation in nine supersized voting areas. For the moment, he does not envisage reducing the number of overall seats, fearing it would be too controversial.
But his party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), wants to cut the seats to 200, and an up-and-coming rival, Your Party, would like to see them slashed to 100. Other differences exist between the proposals, but Mr Nishioka believes they can be ironed out. The main obstacle comes from within the two biggest parties, the DPJ and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The DPJ has a union wing well supported in rural areas. The LDP is the party of choice for farmers, who helped keep it in power for almost all of 55 years until it lost the general election in 2009. 
A glance at the outcome in July's election might convince DPJ holdouts that reform serves them. The party received 39% of the vote and duly won 28 seats of the 73 district seats up for grabs. However the LDP, thanks to its rural following, won 39 seats with only 33.4% of the vote. Mr Nishioka says that one way to win over the LDP may be to persuade it that reform of the lower house, where the DPJ has a big majority, will follow. But given their rural base, perhaps some LDP members are familiar with the English idiom about turkeys voting for Christmas.","Can Japan curb the power of its rural voters?

ONE measure of Japan's dysfunction is the way its system allows weak politicians to rise to the top then spits out each new prime minister in favour of the next unexceptional man. Up to last June, Japan had had four short-lived prime ministers in as many years, each underwhelming. Naoto Kan, prime minister since then, appeared to be made in the same dismal mould. He has achieved little in his time in power and the media, the opposition and much of his own Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) are out to get him.
But just as Mr Kan seemed likely to follow his predecessors into the dustbin of history, he has put together a package of proposed reforms more radical than anything attempted during two decades of economic malaise. Even Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister from 2001-06 who dazzled outsiders and quit while on top, did not attempt anything so bold. 
The agenda is almost recklessly ambitious (
). Mr Kan plans to overhaul social security, giving more credible assurance about the state's ability to pay future benefits. By June he will have plans to raise the consumption (ie, sales) tax as a means of stabilising the finances of one of the world's most indebted countries, in which more government bonds are issued than tax revenues collected. Critics say that would cripple an already beleaguered economy. But, crucially, the plan combines fiscal tightening with measures to stimulate growth. Mr Kan wants Japan to join a radical free-trade area called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, currently being expanded to nine nations, including America. It would mean facing down the farm lobby to remove barriers to some of the planet's most protected rice. Mr Kan's preference for an America-oriented trading block is all of a piece with his efforts to revive the Japanese-American alliance: for the first time since Mr Koizumi, a prime minister is articulating a vision of Japan's place in the world, as well as a response to a rising China.
The proposals make economic sense, which is a novelty in Japan. Yet even in the DPJ, which has strong union backing, they have many vocal critics; and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), whose decades in power are largely responsible for Japan's mess, is determined to bring the government down. If it succeeds in blocking this spring's budget, both Mr Kan and his proposals will soon be history. Take it to the people, Mr Kan
Mr Kan does himself few favours. Though a canny politician, he is a clumsy speaker, with none of Mr Koizumi's razzmatazz. But he has one card up his sleeve: a growing popular frustration with the usual politics. 
If he cannot get politicians' support for his reforms, he should, like Mr Koizumi, go over their heads and appeal to urban voters fed up with cossetting farmers and others. At present the public appears ambivalent: polls suggest mixed feelings on both free trade and a higher consumption tax. However, businessmen and newspapers such as the Yomiuri Shimbun (circulation 10m) are overcoming their initial hostility to Mr Kan and supporting his reforms. The LDP's obstructionism will, in the long run, serve only to show that the party hasn't got two constructive ideas to rub together. 
Mr Kan may have to call a snap election, with all the risks to his own job and his party that might entail. Voters might yet shy away from more engagement with the outside world. But to prove his reform proposals are the product of conviction and not recklessness, Mr Kan must show courage and leadership. If he gets them through, he will have demonstrated to the rest of the world that Japan is not, in the phrase of one observer, just a fly waiting for a windscreen.","Naoto Kan is proposing the boldest reforms to Japan in decades

""JAPANESE prime ministers are just like tissue paper,"" says Yuriko Koike, a senior member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), plucking a tissue from a box as if to throw it in the bin. Her cold disdain sums up the mood of her party. Since the start of the year, the LDP has said it will focus on destroying the government of Naoto Kan.
For Mr Kan, whose Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) ended the LDP's long grip on power in 2009, the opposition is just one of many headaches. On January 31st his bane within the DPJ, Ichiro Ozawa, a former party boss, was indicted on political-funding charges but has so far refused to give up his seat, saying he will clear his name in court. That gives the LDP an excuse to continue throwing accusations of sleaze at the DPJ. 
What is more, opposition parties have threatened to block implementation of the spring budget for the next fiscal year. Without big concessions, it could mean the government is unable to issue bonds to pay for public services. Budget paralysis is still a distant prospect, but on January 27th Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, downgraded Japan's sovereign bonds partly because Mr Kan's government lacked ""a coherent strategy"" to improve the fiscal situation. The prime minister hardly helped matters when he said, on learning of the news, that he was ""clueless"" about it.
Undeterred, however, Mr Kan has stuck to the gamble of his political career. By mid-year he hopes to commit Japan to joining an ambitious free-trade pact including America. He also hopes to produce a plan to raise the consumption (sales) tax to help pay for an overhaul of the social-security system, which is about to face an onslaught of retiring baby-boomers.
By itself, a decision to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would, in the words of a trade official, be ""epoch-making"". Mr Kan has told the nine countries in the negotiations (America, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam) that if Japan decides to join, it will put ""everything on the table"". In other words, it may not demand special protection for its rice farmers, who shelter behind tariffs of nearly 800%. Japan may, however, seek a slow phase-in of the farm cuts.
The prime minister has also promised to draw up a plan for farm reform aimed at promoting export-oriented agriculture, rather than precious yet unproductive paddy fields. Elderly farmers form a powerful voting block, and analysts say they are likely to create a ruckus against reform. Yet Mr Kan's ministers are expected to tour the country this month in order to drum up support for free trade. According to opinion polls, at least half the country is already in favour.
If Japan does join the talks, it will be running to catch up. America hopes to conclude its TPP negotiations, which have already started without Japan, in time for a regional summit in Hawaii in November. Mr Kan's government argues that, despite the handicap, Japan has little choice but to join. Neighbouring South Korea has negotiated free-trade deals with the European Union and the United States, and Japanese industry fears being left behind. Businessmen note that whereas the value of trade with Japan's free-trade partners represents 16% of the total, South Korea's corresponding level is more than twice that.
If free trade is not ambitious enough, Mr Kan has set out to confront another taboo by June, with plans to raise the consumption tax. At 5%, the tax is the lowest in the rich world, and in the past leaders have paid a high price for meddling with it. Prime ministers who introduced it in 1989, and raised it in 1997, both lost their jobs fairly soon afterwards. When, ahead of upper-house elections last year, Mr Kan unexpectedly discussed a tax increase, voters punished the DPJ at the ballot box.
Yet Mr Kan has ploughed on. He has appointed Kaoru Yosano, an LDP exile and fiscal hawk, to broker cross-party consensus on his reform plans. Both the LDP and parts of the DPJ have reacted scathingly to the appointment. Even those who back fiscal consolidation have doubts about Mr Kan's ability to pull it off. ""They can say whatever they like,"" says Takahira Ogawa, the analyst at Standard & Poor's who downgraded the debt. ""I seriously doubt how much groundwork they have done.""
Mr Kan has some influential supporters, however. Keidanren, the business lobby that was once firmly in the LDP camp, has switched sides. Its chairman, Hiromasa Yonekura, recently suggested that in rural areas the LDP may be sowing ""misleading"" information about the TPP. The country's biggest newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, is also promoting the merits of TPP and a higher consumption tax to its 10m readers. Its ancient chairman, Tsuneo Watanabe, is an ally of Mr Yosano; the paper has been notably kinder to Mr Kan since the former LDP finance minister joined the cabinet.
No one predicts a smooth ride between now and June. Municipal and prefectural elections are due for April, and opposition parties are loth to do deals with the government beforehand. Though the DPJ has the votes in the lower house of the Diet (parliament) to secure passage of the budget, it lacks the upper-house majority to pass laws to implement it. If the opposition blocked the budget, it would have the excuse to demand that Mr Kan stand down.
To pre-empt that, some people believe he might call a snap election and run on the strength of his reform plans. The prime minister himself insists that is not on the cards. Yet if push comes to shove, there is a chance that Mr Kan--or a more charismatic substitute--might pull it off.","Naoto Kan takes a big gamble on economic reforms

Prime ministers who introduced it in 1989 , and raised it in 1997 , both lost their jobs fairly soon afterwards . When , ahead of upper - house elections last year , Mr Kan unexpectedly discussed a tax increase , voters punished the DPJ at the ballot box . 
 Yet Mr Kan has ploughed on . He has appointed Kaoru Yosano , an LDP exile and fiscal hawk , to broker cross - party consensus on his reform plans . Both the LDP and parts of the DPJ have reacted scathingly to the appointment . Even those who back fiscal consolidation have doubts about Mr Kan 's ability to pull it off . "" They can say whatever they like , "" says Takahira Ogawa , the analyst at Standard & Poor 's who downgraded the debt . "" I seriously doubt how much groundwork they have done . "" 
 Mr Kan has some influential supporters , however . Keidanren , the business lobby that was once firmly in the LDP camp , has switched sides . Its chairman , Hiromasa Yonekura , recently suggested that in rural areas the LDP may be sowing "" misleading "" information about the TPP . The country 's biggest newspaper , the Yomiuri Shimbun , is also promoting the merits of TPP and a higher consumption tax to its 10 m readers . Its ancient chairman , Tsuneo Watanabe , is an ally of Mr Yosano ; the paper has been notably kinder to Mr Kan since the former LDP finance minister joined the cabinet . 
 No one predicts a smooth ride between now and June . Municipal and prefectural elections are due for April , and opposition parties are loth to do deals with the government beforehand . Though the DPJ has the votes in the lower house of the Diet ( parliament ) to secure passage of the budget , it lacks the upper - house majority to pass laws to implement it . If the opposition blocked the budget , it would have the excuse to demand that Mr Kan stand down . 
 To pre - empt that , some people believe he might call a snap election and run on the strength of his reform plans . The prime minister himself insists that is not on the cards . Yet if push comes to shove , there is a chance that Mr Kan -- or a more charismatic substitute -- might pull it off .",740,Japan,A30-187,IN TERM,True,"Mr Kan , whose Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) ended the LDP 's long grip on power in 2009",3,True

IT WAS hardly a ""mad-as-hell"" moment, but still. On learning on February 6th that he had won a landslide re-election victory as mayor of Nagoya, one of Japan's biggest industrial cities, Takashi Kawamura put on a pair of black rubber boots while a small group of supporters threw buckets of cold water over his head. 
Hours later, with a nod to America's tax-cutting rebels, Mr Kawamura declared that a kind of tea party had been born in Nagoya. He sat alongside his political ally, Hideaki Omura, who on the same day thrashed his rivals for the governorship of the surrounding prefecture of Aichi, home to Toyota. It was hard to judge how serious they were, not least because, dressed in anoraks, they looked like the Two Ronnies, a 1970s British comedy duo. ""This is a citizen's revolution,"" Mr Omura declared. 
The national media dismisses the election results as a provincial fuss, saying that voters were simply fed up with Prime Minister Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), along with its main rival, and will back any alternative, however quirky. Yet the vote bodes ill for Mr Kan ahead of April elections for 13 governors, 44 prefectural assemblies and umpteen mayorships and municipal assemblies.
The media may be missing a trick. Nagoya citizens not only gave Mr Kawamura three times the votes of his DPJ rival. Nearly three-quarters of them supported a referendum to dissolve the current Nagoya assembly, an unprecedented revolt.
Should Messrs Kawamura and Omura manage to stuff the new assemblies with their supporters in the spring elections, they could help unleash forces of decentralisation in Japan. Both intend to merge the city and prefectural governments, to create a regional block to draw investment and jobs away from Tokyo and help reshape government to cope with an ageing society. They plan to cut local taxes by 10%, slash salaries for elected officials, and shed overlapping public services.
In Tokyo this is all seen as autocratic. Yet the two men have touched a nerve. Officials in cash-strapped Aichi receive up to {Yen}28m ($340,000) as a perk on retirement. That compares with {Yen}20m at Toyota. The prefecture's debt, meanwhile, stands at {Yen}585,000 yen a citizen.
The Aichi revolt has echoes in other regions. Toru Hashimoto, governor of Osaka prefecture, Japan's second-biggest industrial hub, is campaigning on a promise to build a similar megalopolis, though against opposition from local mayors. Other prefectures such as Niigata also think of merging with their capitals. Too many municipal administrations exist, with shaky tax bases, and indeed prefectures too.
Mr Kawamura reckons the movement will come to resemble the alliance of fiefs in western Japan that helped topple the shogunate in the 1860s. Mr Omura, less prone to hyperbole, says that all big Japanese cities are in a struggle to compete with the likes of Shanghai, so why should Tokyo have all the advantages? Competition, he says, takes place not between nations, but rather cities. No wonder Tokyoites want to belittle the movement.","Some see a tea party brewing in Japan 's hinterland

JAPAN, one of the great exporting nations, usually runs a trade deficit with, of all places, Switzerland. Why? Ask Rolex. Japan also buys more from France and Italy than it sells there. Why? Bordeaux, Brie, mascarpone and Armani, to name a few expensive vices. In Japan such delicacies are mostly immune to deflation, while prices of everyday goods like cars, electronic goods and clothes tumble. Why then do Japanese firms continue to churn out the latter, even though margins are low? And could this help explain Japan's persistent deflation problem?
These questions preoccupy Kosuke Motani, author of ""The Real Face of Deflation"". In this book's first seven months in print, 500,000 copies have been sold, including one to Naoto Kan, the prime minister. Mr Motani argues that deflation in Japan is not so much a monetary problem as a structural one linked to bad business decisions and demography. 
If Japanese firms produced new types of luxury goods, he believes, they could unleash pent-up demand among Japan's growing, and wealthy, ranks of old people and pay higher wages to Japan's shrinking, and relatively poor, youth. Unsurprisingly, his views have won a sympathetic hearing at the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which has often been accused of failing to do enough to reverse falling prices.
At a news conference on February 7th Masaaki Shirakawa, the BoJ's governor, touched on similar themes. The fundamental cause of deflation, he said, was the protracted downward trend in Japan's underlying GDP growth, caused both by the decrease in the number of workers and declining productivity growth. Monetary easing was important to ease deflationary pressures, but by itself was not enough, he asserted. Businesses needed to bring more old people and women into jobs, to counter the decline in the working-age population. They also needed to go beyond the concept of monozukuri--the well-honed skill of making things--to shikake zukuri, which he described as the creation of products that attract demand by telling a new story, as Sony once did with the Walkman. 
Many will argue that this line is a cop-out. Businessmen quibble that they could better tap fast-growing markets in Asia if the BoJ did more to cheapen the yen. Critical economists such as Koichi Hamada of Yale University argue that if the BoJ put more cash into people's wallets, it would spur domestic demand. Many believe it will take a combination of forces to end deflation in Japan, and one of the biggest dangers is that government agencies, including the central bank, put the onus on others to fix the problem.
There does, however, finally appear to be some joined-up thinking. Mr Shirakawa supports Mr Kan's efforts to raise productivity by promoting free trade. If Japan raises its consumption tax to improve the public finances, the BoJ may be prepared to use accommodative monetary policy to offset fiscal tightening. 
Where Mr Shirakawa and Mr Motani most directly see eye to eye is on the need for companies to boost domestic demand by unleashing the latent spending power of the elderly, who sit on the vast majority of Japanese households' {Yen}1,500 trillion ($18 trillion) of savings. Mr Shirakawa believes there will be growing demand for health care, nursing, tourism and leisure. He reckons that a 40% rise in the turnover of fitness clubs in Japan in the past decade is due to increasing health consciousness as people live longer. He says deregulation would increase supply in such fields. 
Mr Motani takes a more draconian view. He is fed up with the elderly hoarding their money. He says they do this because of a ""King Lear"" complex: they feel they will be deserted if they give too much away. And he favours tax reform to encourage them to bequeath their money to their grandchildren, rather than their children. One of the flipsides of longevity, he points out, is that the average age of those who inherit is a grand old 67.

PROOF of mass murder could lie in a genteel enclave of west-central Tokyo. It took over four years for the government to remove an inhabited block of flats so that the search for the truth might start. But on February 21st two diggers began scooping up and gently winnowing the ground in search of human remains. Barely a word about it has appeared in the national press.
Japanese journalists do not usually shy away from a murder mystery. But this one is in a different league. The site might be a link to one of the most atrocious sets of crimes Japan committed during the second world war. It involved medics in Unit 731, a covert body in the Japanese imperial army charged with developing techniques of chemical and biological warfare. The medics carried out experiments on humans, including vivisection without anaesthetic. Some later rose to the top of Japan's post-war medical establishment, abetted by occupying American forces. 
The excavations stem from testimony given to the government in 2006 by Toyo Ishii, a former nurse at a nearby army medical school during the war. There she often encountered doctors working on pickled human remains. She said she did not know what they were doing. As the Americans approached in 1945, she and her colleagues were hastily ordered to get rid of the body parts. Human remains, she said, were buried on the site where the diggers are now working. Ms Ishii says she saw a dog run off with a human bone. 
It is no secret that the medical school was the Tokyo headquarters of Unit 731. Most of the unit's activities took place in occupied Manchuria, in north-east China, where the victims of its ghastly experiments were Chinese, Koreans and Russians. They were exposed to plague and cholera. Those who suffered vivisection, including women made pregnant by the doctors, were called ""lumber"".
Since 2002 Tokyo courts have at least acknowledged that Unit 731 took part in experiments in germ warfare. American documents also reveal that some American occupiers valued the results of the experiments, however horrific, and shielded the medics from trial for war crimes. Many of the unit's staff went on to top positions in leading drugs firms and universities, and some set up Japan's first commercial blood bank, Green Cross, which later became notorious when 200 Japanese died from transfusions of blood tainted with HIV.
Yet the government has never acknowledged Unit 731's atrocities, even after mutilated skulls and bones were discovered in 1989 a few hundred yards from the excavation site. A black obelisk stands where the remains are buried, describing them merely as human ""specimens"". Chinese requests for DNA samples to establish the identity of the remains have been rejected. 
The health ministry doubts that anything will come of the new investigation. But if the ministry is wrong, the government of Naoto Kan faces a challenge. The Democratic Party of Japan is the country's first ruling party whose leaders are not linked to Japan's belligerent past. Mr Kan himself is keen to improve strained relations with Japan's once-oppressed neighbours, especially South Korea and China. 
Back when he was health minister, Mr Kan made his name by helping to expose the scandal of HIV-tainted blood peddled by Green Cross. Separately, he also promises to ""examine every grain of sand"" to repatriate the remains of 13,000 fallen Japanese soldiers who are still unaccounted for at the Pacific Island battleground of Iwo Jima. If the burial site in Tokyo contains the remains of foreigners and he does not seek to make amends, he will lay himself open to accusations of double standards. At the moment, the press silence suggests that the Japanese in general still lack an appetite for atonement.

""PRIME MINISTER KAN, this is no time for you to nap,"" barked Shoji Nishida, an opposition lawmaker shortly before he made insinuations that led to the resignation of Japan's foreign minister on March 6th. Sure enough, his actions have thrown the government of Naoto Kan (pictured above, right) into peril. 
During questioning in the Japanese Diet (parliament), Mr Nishida, who is unaffectionately known as the ""Bombshell"", forced the minister, Seiji Maehara (pictured above on the left), to admit that he had taken political funding from a Korean-born Japanese resident (see next story). That would be illegal if Mr Maehara knowingly accepted the donation, which he says he did not. 
Mr Maehara abruptly quit, robbing Mr Kan of perhaps the administration's steadiest hand. The 48-year-old had refurbished Tokyo's strained relations with America, and looked like a prime minister-in-waiting. He was replaced by his deputy, Takeaki Matsumoto. The blow comes as Mr Kan struggles to pass a budget in the face of political gridlock. The ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) faces a pounding in local elections in April. Soon, Mr Kan may be on the ropes.
What chiefly prevents him from becoming the fifth prime minister to fall in as many years is the lack of a credible replacement, either in his party or in the opposition. Mr Kan's hold over his own party has grown too flimsy for his bold promises to reform Japan's tax and social-security system, and open the country to free trade, to carry much weight. Yet his rivals in the DPJ, a good many of whom are lowly first-time lawmakers, seem to fear a general election as much as he does. 
The opposition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), threatens to use its upper-house majority to block bills needed to finance next year's budget. By the summer the government might run out of money. The LDP's bet is that Mr Kan will need to dissolve parliament in return for winning support for the budget. If he resists, the LDP might censure him in the upper house, producing a similar outcome.
But however unpopular Mr Kan is, the LDP, foaming at the mouth and bereft of ideas, has scarcely more support. Indeed, the only group benefiting from the political mess is a raucous regional tax-cutting movement attacking mainstream politics. Some call it the ""sake"" party, an allusion to America's tea-party movement.
For all their mutual antagonisms, the mainstream parties broadly share long-term aims for Japan: they want a stronger social-safety net, slightly higher taxes and a more open economy. During nine months in office, however, Mr Kan, a former civil-rights activist, has come across as an agitator rather than a builder of bridges. The opposition, meanwhile, has been petty and vituperative. Neither party would convincingly win a general election. The hunt for a leader with the innate Japanese skill of nemawashi, or consensus-forming, will be key. Such a leader is not in sight.","Yet again , a Japanese government is tottering

THAT ""tsunami"" is one of the few Japanese words in global use points to the country's familiarity with natural disaster. But even measured against Japan's painful history, its plight today is miserable. The magnitude-9 earthquake--the largest ever in the country's history, equivalent in power to 30,000 Hiroshimas--was followed by a wave which wiped out whole towns. With news dribbling out from stricken coastal communities, the scale of the horror is still sinking in. The surge of icy water shoved the debris of destroyed towns miles inland, killing most of those too old or too slow to scramble to higher ground (see pages
). The official death toll of 5,429 will certainly rise. In several towns over half the population has drowned or is missing.
In the face of calamity, a decent people has proved extremely resilient: no looting; very little complaining among the tsunami survivors. In Tokyo people queued patiently to meet their tax deadlines. Everywhere there was a calm determination to conjure a little order out of chaos. Volunteers have rushed to help. The country's Self-Defence Forces, which dithered in response to the Kobe earthquake in 1995, have poured into the stricken area. Naoto Kan, the prime minister, who started the crisis with very low public support, has so far managed to keep a semblance of order in the country, despite a series of calamities that would challenge even the strongest of leaders. The government's inept handling of the Kobe disaster did much to undermine Japan's confidence in itself. The wider concern
The immediate tragedy may be Japan's; but it also throws up longer-term questions that will eventually affect people all the way round the globe. Stockmarkets stumbled on fears about the impact on the world's third-biggest economy. Japan's central bank seems to have stilled talk of financial panic with huge injections of liquidity. Early estimates of the total damage are somewhat higher than the $100 billion that Kobe cost, but not enough to wreck a rich country. Disruption to electricity supplies will damage growth, and some Asian supply chains are already facing problems; but new infrastructure spending will offset some of the earthquake's drag on growth. 
Those calculations could change dramatically if the nuclear crisis worsens. As The Economist went to press, helicopters were dropping water to douse overheating nuclear fuel stored at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, where there have been explosions, fires and releases of radiation greater, it seems, than the Japanese authorities had admitted. The country's nuclear industry has a long history of cover-ups and incompetence, and--notwithstanding the heroism of individual workers--the handling of the crisis by TEPCO, the nuclear plant's operator, is sadly in line with its past performance. 
Even if the nuclear accident is brought under control swiftly, and the release of radiation turns out not to be large enough to damage public health, this accident will have a huge impact on the nuclear industry, both inside and outside Japan. Germany has already put on hold its politically tricky decision to extend the life of its nuclear plants. America's faltering steps towards new reactors look sure to be set back, not least because new concerns will mean greater costs.
China has announced a pause in its ambitious plans for nuclear growth. With 27 reactors under construction, more than twice as many as any other country, China accounts for almost half the world's current nuclear build-out--and it has plans for 50 more reactors. And in the long term the regime looks unlikely to be much deterred from these plans--and certainly not by its public's opinion, whatever that might be. China has a huge thirst for energy that it will slake from as many wells as it can, with planned big increases in wind power and in gas as well as the nuclear build-out and ever more coal-fired plants.
Thus the great nuclear dilemma. For the best nuclear safety you need not just good planning and good engineering. You need the sort of society that can produce accountability and transparency, one that can build institutions that receive and deserve trust. No nuclear nation has done this as well as one might wish, and Japan's failings may well become more evident. But democracies are better at building such institutions. At the same time, however, democracy makes it much easier for a substantial and implacable minority to make sure things don't happen, and that seems likely to be the case with plans for more nuclear power. Thus nuclear power looks much more likely to spread in societies that are unlikely to ground it in the enduring culture of safety that it needs. China's nearest competitor in the new-build stakes is Russia.
Yet democracies would be wrong to turn their back on nuclear power. It still has the advantages of offering reliable power, a degree of energy security, and no carbon dioxide emissions beyond those incurred in building and supplying the plants. In terms of lives lost it has also boasted, to date, a reasonably good record. Chernobyl's death toll is highly uncertain, but may have reached a few thousand people. China's coal mines certainly kill 2,000-3,000 workers a year, and coal-smogged air there and elsewhere kills many more. It remains a reasonable idea for most rich countries to keep some nuclear power in their portfolio, not least because by maintaining economic and technological stakes in nuclear they will have more standing to insist on high standards for safety and non-proliferation being applied throughout the world. But in the face of panic, of sinister towers of smoke, of invisible and implacable threats, the reasonable course is not an easy one. Back to Tokyo
No country faces that choice more painfully than Japan, scarred by nuclear energy but also deprived of native alternatives. To abandon nuclear power is to commit the country to massive imports of gas and perhaps coal. To keep it is to face and overcome a national trauma and to accept a small but real risk of another disaster.
Japan's all too frequent experience of calamity suggests that such events are often followed by great change. After the earthquake of 1923, it turned to militarism. After its defeat in the second world war, and the dropping of the atom bombs, it espoused peaceful growth. The Kobe earthquake reinforced Japan's recent turning in on itself. 
This new catastrophe seems likely to have a similarly huge impact on the nation's psyche. It may be that the Japanese people's impressive response to disaster, and the rest of the world's awe in the face of their stoicism, restores the self-confidence the country so badly needs. It may be that the failings of its secretive system of governance, exemplified by the shoddy management of its nuclear plants, lead to more demands for political reform. As long as Mr Kan can convince the public that the government's information on radiation is trustworthy, and that it can ease the cold and hunger of tsunami survivors, his hand may be strengthened to further liberalise Japan. Or it may be that things take a darker turn.
The stakes are high. Japan--a despondent country with a dysfunctional political system--badly needs change. It seems just possible that, looking back from a safe distance, Japan's people will regard this dreadful moment not just as a time of death, grief and mourning, but also as a time of rebirth.","Some natural disasters change history . Japan 's tsunami could be one 
 THAT "" tsunami "" is one of the few Japanese words in global use points to the country 's familiarity with natural disaster . But even measured against Japan 's painful history , its plight today is miserable . The magnitude-9 earthquake -- the largest ever in the country 's history , equivalent in power to 30,000 Hiroshimas -- was followed by a wave which wiped out whole towns . With news dribbling out from stricken coastal communities , the scale of the horror is still sinking in . The surge of icy water shoved the debris of destroyed towns miles inland , killing most of those too old or too slow to scramble to higher ground ( see pages 
 ) . The official death toll of 5,429 will certainly rise . In several towns over half the population has drowned or is missing . 
 In the face of calamity , a decent people has proved extremely resilient : no looting ; very little complaining among the tsunami survivors . In Tokyo people queued patiently to meet their tax deadlines . Everywhere there was a calm determination to conjure a little order out of chaos . Volunteers have rushed to help . The country 's Self - Defence Forces , which dithered in response to the Kobe earthquake in 1995 , have poured into the stricken area . Naoto Kan , has so far managed to keep a semblance of order in the country , despite a series of calamities that would challenge even the strongest of leaders . The government 's inept handling of the Kobe disaster did much to undermine Japan 's confidence in itself . The wider concern 
 The immediate tragedy may be Japan 's ; but it also throws up longer - term questions that will eventually affect people all the way round the globe . Stockmarkets stumbled on fears about the impact on the world 's third - biggest economy . Japan 's central bank seems to have stilled talk of financial panic with huge injections of liquidity . Early estimates of the total damage are somewhat higher than the $ 100 billion that Kobe cost , but not enough to wreck a rich country . Disruption to electricity supplies will damage growth , and some Asian supply chains are already facing problems ; but new infrastructure spending will offset some of the earthquake 's drag on growth . 
 Those calculations could change dramatically if the nuclear crisis worsens . As The Economist went to press , helicopters were dropping water to douse overheating nuclear fuel stored at the Fukushima Dai - ichi plant , where there have been explosions , fires and releases of radiation greater , it seems , than the Japanese authorities had admitted .

UP A shallow river, five kilometres from the Pacific coast in Japan's north-eastern Iwate prefecture, lie the remains of a town. Crushed wooden houses now resemble matchwood, scattered in every direction over swampy wasteland. A purple car is partially submerged in mud. The piles of debris reach two metres high.
Only on close inspection do you see that it was never a town at all--at least not there. It was a rice paddy. The houses, shops, cars and people belonged lower down the valley. But the town is gone, washed away. Its debris settled on the field, high up the valley, that was the tsunami's high-water mark. That is all that physically remains of Rikuzentakata.
Rikuzentakata, a former whaling town, once held 23,000 people. Several hundred are confirmed dead, but at mid-week perhaps thousands more were still missing. All tried to flee, as they were trained to do, when the tsunami warnings sounded in mid-afternoon. But this was a town of old people, as fishing villages here invariably are. Many just could not make it. Their fate was shared by perhaps tens of thousands of people living in ports, coastal towns and tiny cove communities across the north-east. Some, though, were spared. Above a washed-away hamlet clay-tiled homes are still standing, and a garden with tenderly coiffed trees. Even higher up is a small cemetery.
Japan, which shows its love of nature in its reverence for trees and seasons, also knows the awesome power of the physical world--and fears it. Its orderly and law-abiding people know they live on one of the most geologically violent archipelagoes on the planet. The earthquake that struck on the afternoon of March 11th had a magnitude of 9.0, the biggest in Japan's recorded history. It was so strong that, even in Tokyo's shock-absorbing skyscrapers, office workers cowered beneath their desks and then raced out into the street, only to be hit again by the whump of aftershocks. 
As the quake lifted the ocean floor, it triggered a tsunami (the word is Japanese) that breached with ease some of what were considered to be Japan's best coastal defences. As of March 17th the police said at least 14,000 people were dead or missing along the coast, though that fails to account for the tens of thousands who are unreported to the authorities, supposed lost, in places like Rikuzentakata. As many as half a million are in emergency shelters, shivering through a bitterly cold snowstorm that has added to the sense of crisis. Because of damaged roads, petrol shortages and bungling bureaucrats, many lack essentials such as food, water, toilet paper, nappies and kerosene for heating. A shocking number appear to be in their 90s, looked after by people who are themselves grandmothers and grandfathers. Amid the debris in Rikuzentakata, a 62-year-old woman wearing trainers was prodding around for her 94-year-old aunt. The president of a nearby construction company had tried to help the aunt escape, but he too was washed away. Her niece had been searching fruitlessly for her every day since March 12th. 
Appalling as these people's plights are, they have been eclipsed for most of the week by fear of an altogether different sort: that of a meltdown in the damaged Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant, some 240km north-east of Tokyo (see next story). Nuclear experts say the potential danger to human health from the three stricken reactors has so far been blown out of proportion--especially when set against the wider-spread suffering of the tsunami victims. But there is a gnawing sense that Japan, the only country to have suffered mass radiation from atomic attack (and hence an expert in its consequences for long-term health), may be on the verge of another nuclear nightmare. Inevitably, the latest crisis will renew debate about the wisdom of building nuclear-power plants on such unstable and exposed terrain. Experts, however, can barely imagine Japan meeting its energy needs without them. A government under siege
The palpable fear of the unknown can be heard in the words of Katsunobu Sakurai, the mayor of Minamisoma. His town straddles the 20km exclusion zone surrounding the Fukushima plant, as well as the 30km circle in which as many as 136,000 people are being urged to stay indoors to avoid radiation. Speaking by telephone to NHK, Japan's national broadcaster, on March 16th, he said that people were now ""trying their best to stay calm"", but many would flee the area altogether if they could only find fuel to make the journey. He said the most basic supplies were running short because outsiders were not willing to transport them to the danger zone. Whenever he is interviewed, he begs the government for help. 
The government, though, is besieged on many fronts. Naoto Kan, the prime minister, entered a crisis of hydra-headed complexity with feeble popularity and little public respect. Until Mr Kan's Democratic Party of Japan took power in 2009, Japan had seen its institutions of government corroded by 55 years of one-party rule; and one of the biggest bones of contention had been the nuclear-power industry.
Generally the safety record has been good, considering the number of plants and their length of service. But when there have been accidents, a shameful record of cover-ups, lackadaisical crisis management and an inbred complicity between regulators and utilities has given the public ample reason for scepticism. 
The first response of Mr Kan, a former civil activist, has suggested that he is reacting more openly, though he hardly exudes authority. If his presence has been hit-and-miss during the crisis, that cannot be said of his steadfast chief of staff, Yukio Edano. Mr Edano has produced frequent updates on the unfolding nuclear crisis, while avoiding sowing panic among the public. In his blue overalls (now standard kit for Mr Kan and his team), he looks to many the epitome of the stalwart line manager.
But if the Fukushima crisis worsens, Mr Kan's ability to lay blame for the mishaps on the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the owner of the power plant, will wear thin--not least because the government has set up a crisis committee with TEPCO that appears to put the company firmly in charge. Also, there is the lingering danger of panic. Foreigners with families in Tokyo have reacted most nervously. As the radiation has risen they have taken bullet trains to Osaka, in western Japan, and flights out of the country, quietly supported by their firms and embassies.
Most residents of greater Tokyo--at 35m, the most populous metropolitan area in the world--have shown much more stoicism, partly because the authorities and media have remained calm. Despite radiation fears, aftershock warnings, power cuts, train disruption and half-empty supermarkets, many queued patiently on March 15th to meet their tax deadlines. But the next day, reflecting the seriousness of the situation, 77-year-old Emperor Akihito gave a rare televised address to express his ""deep concern"". He had been quiet until then, despite messages of support coming in from royalty around the world. 
For the authorities, one increasingly apparent danger is that the nuclear drama is distracting them from what should be an equally pressing priority. They need to find a way to move supplies to the stricken towns and villages in the north-east. Takeshi Niinami, chief executive of Lawson, Japan's second-largest chain of convenience stores (which lost 68 stores in Friday's disasters, with more than 100 staff unaccounted for), saysthat the urgent priority is to renew fuel supplies to Tohoku, the north-eastern region and the scene of the disaster. Without fuel, he says, local factories have been unable to produce rice balls and other food supplies; nor is there enough petrol for food brought from elsewhere in Japan to be trucked to the hardest-hit areas.
Mr Kan has ordered 100,000 troops from Japan's Self-Defence Forces to the region, but according to Mr Niinami their task is to find dead bodies rather than distribute supplies. He has urged the authorities to divert passenger planes to help airlift provisions. Others in the affected region blame the bureaucratic mindset of civil servants for blocking the flow of emergency supplies.
Layered over the humanitarian and nuclear drama is yet another mounting concern: the effect on Japan's economy. It is in a parlous state, suffering from slow growth, high debt and relative decline (see chart). Many economists at first suggested that things were not as bad as they looked. Of course, there would be a short-term dip in growth. But as reconstruction began, growth would pick up again. The international impact, too, would be limited. Supply-chain disruption would cause some problems, especially in the electronics industry, but overall the expected boost in Japanese imports as it rebuilt would help the rest of the world.
That, at least, is what the history of recent Asian disasters suggests. The tsunami of December 2004 and the Kashmir earthquake of October 2005 involved death and destruction on an even wider scale, yet had virtually no impact on growth rates. That was largely because the victims were mostly poor people who added little to GDP. But even the Kobe earthquake of 1995--the second-biggest ever to hit a modern urban area--had a surprisingly modest effect (
). Within 15 months industrial production in Kobe had almost reached pre-quake levels, and Japan as a whole suffered only one quarter of declining output. 
A second reason to expect the economy to cope is that although the area affected by the tsunami and quake was vast, it contains no Kobes. It is less populated and less industrialised. According to calculations by economists at Nomura, an investment bank, the three worst-hit prefectures (Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate) account for just 3.6% of Japan's economy, though electronics factories are clustered there. 
Adding in neighbouring Nagano, Ibaraki and Niigata prefectures, which were much less damaged, brings the affected area's contribution to GDP to 10.8%. That is a big chunk. But Tomo Kinoshita of Nomura nevertheless estimates that the direct negative hit to Japan's GDP would be limited to between 0.25 and 0.5 percentage points in the first quarter, and 0.5 and 1 percentage point in the second. Another bank, Goldman Sachs, estimates the cost of the damage at {Yen}16 trillion ($202 billion), or about 4% of GDP. Spread over a few years of reconstruction, that should easily be affordable--a drop in the ocean of Japanese public indebtedness.
However, first guesses about the disaster's impact have been overtaken by further disasters. The nuclear crisis at Fukushima broadens the economic danger in at least three ways. First, the perceived risk of radiation may close businesses, deter investment and hamper rebuilding. TEPCO, with its shares hammered, now faces worries about its creditworthiness. And selling nuclear-energy technology abroad--Toshiba, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries all produce reactors--is one of the linchpins of Mr Kan's growth strategy.
Second, electricity rationing may keep output depressed for longer than originally anticipated. Only a week after the quake, Tokyo was facing rolling blackouts. And third, the nervous mood makes financial panic more likely. Over three days the Bank of Japan announced plans to inject a total of {Yen}55.6 trillion into financial markets, to avoid a collapse in investor confidence and keep credit flowing. On March 14th and 15th shares on the Tokyo exchange fell by over 16%, their worst two-day fall since 1987. They have recovered somewhat since, but the yen also strengthened to record highs against the dollar. A nuclear meltdown may yet lead to a financial one. That would add another international risk--financial contagion--to all the other dangers looming over Japan. 
Supply-chain concerns are mounting as it becomes apparent that more Japanese factories may be closed for longer than first thought, and that a surprising number of gizmos assembled in China, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere depend on Japanese components. There were also fears that the price of oil, which at first fell a bit because of an expected drop in Japanese demand, might be driven even higher as Japan makes up for the shortfall in nuclear power, at a time of tensions in north Africa and the Middle East. Phoenix in the east
The tasks facing Japan are staggering. But a country does not live on a geological time bomb without some accommodation by the national psyche. The legacy of centuries of rebuilding cities, temples and homes after tsunamis, fires and earthquakes has provided many Japanese with a fatalistic streak. In the past they have often risen to the task of rebuilding; it provides a sense of national purpose.
Twice in the past century, Tokyo has re-emerged out of the rubble. After the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, in which 143,000 people died, the recovery turned poisonous; amid the wreckage, sword-wielding Japanese set about wantonly killing Korean immigrants. Democratic shoots were trampled, and nationalistic passions eventually drove Japan to war. Two decades later, in 1945, destruction came from American bombs. The zeal to rebuild was again remarkable. Within a generation, Japan had turned--peacefully this time--from one of the chief recipients of World Bank aid into an industrial superpower.
The past 20 years of stagnation and deflation--albeit with high levels of conspicuous consumption--have left many yearning for a new sense of purpose. It is perhaps a chilling reflection of this that comments by Shintaro Ishihara, the right-wing governor of Tokyo, harking back to imperial days by calling the disaster ""divine retribution"" for Japan's culture of ""greed"", have found some resonance, especially among elderly Japanese. Others will be furious.
More thoughtful voices propose more constructive ways to forge a new sense of purpose. Many foreigners have expressed deep admiration for the calm resilience the Japanese have demonstrated this week (see Banyan). A university professor, stuck for 25 hours on a short train journey to Tokyo as a result of the earthquake, wrote a long piece on Facebook about the patience of his fellow passengers, the solicitousness of the railway staff, and the spotless toilets. ""If you have to spend 16 hours in a stationary train and an additional nine hours getting home, do it in Japan,"" he wrote. Japanese people say they take heart from such commendations. 
As for the future, Hideaki Shiroyama, a public-policy expert at the University of Tokyo, says a big indication of Japan's willingness to shake off its lethargy will be the inevitable debate on nuclear energy that emerges from the disaster. Part of the public scepticism about the industry, he believes, stems from a regulatory structure that remains mired in the past. The industry is fiercely tribal, and regulators are too close to the utilities. Even before the emergency, he says, calls from within the industry for change went unheard. 
Similarly, he says Japan's policy towards rebuilding fishing communities such as Rikuzentakata will be a chance to think creatively. An enlightened response would be for many of the demolished communities to be abandoned for ever, because in Japan's greying society their residents are mainly pensioners. It would make more sense to rehouse them in higher-density communities closer to shops and hospitals. But even those whose houses have been destroyed by the tsunami are loth to leave--these are ancestral plots that are meant to stay in the family. And the fishing grounds are rich. Since Japan instinctively solves any economic problem by throwing concrete and dollops of public money at it (tight as money is), the elderly will probably get their way. 
The rebuilding, as well as the discussion about Japan's future energy sources, might be easier if the political system encouraged debate and compromise, rather than partisan gridlock. To rebuild Japan, the public spirit shown by citizens in the face of today's catastrophe needs to inspire the political class, promoting collaboration and unity. As Mr Kan says, Japan has to pull together. If the earthquake helps Japan repair its social fabric and recover its sense of purpose, it may yet bring something other than tragedy in its wake.

He had been quiet until then , despite messages of support coming in from royalty around the world . 
 For the authorities , one increasingly apparent danger is that the nuclear drama is distracting them from what should be an equally pressing priority . They need to find a way to move supplies to the stricken towns and villages in the north - east . Takeshi Niinami , chief executive of Lawson , Japan 's second - largest chain of convenience stores ( which lost 68 stores in Friday 's disasters , with more than 100 staff unaccounted for ) , saysthat the urgent priority is to renew fuel supplies to Tohoku , the north - eastern region and the scene of the disaster . Without fuel , he says , local factories have been unable to produce rice balls and other food supplies ; nor is there enough petrol for food brought from elsewhere in Japan to be trucked to the hardest - hit areas . Naoto Kan has ordered 100,000 troops from Japan 's Self - Defence Forces to the region , but according to Mr Niinami their task is to find dead bodies rather than distribute supplies . He has urged the authorities to divert passenger planes to help airlift provisions . Others in the affected region blame the bureaucratic mindset of civil servants for blocking the flow of emergency supplies . 
 Layered over the humanitarian and nuclear drama is yet another mounting concern : the effect on Japan 's economy . It is in a parlous state , suffering from slow growth , high debt and relative decline ( see chart ) . Many economists at first suggested that things were not as bad as they looked . Of course , there would be a short - term dip in growth . But as reconstruction began , growth would pick up again . The international impact , too , would be limited . Supply - chain disruption would cause some problems , especially in the electronics industry , but overall the expected boost in Japanese imports as it rebuilt would help the rest of the world . 
 That , at least , is what the history of recent Asian disasters suggests . The tsunami of December 2004 and the Kashmir earthquake of October 2005 involved death and destruction on an even wider scale , yet had virtually no impact on growth rates . That was largely because the victims were mostly poor people who added little to GDP . But even the Kobe earthquake of 1995 - -the second - biggest ever to hit a modern urban area -- had a surprisingly modest effect ( 
 ) . Within 15 months industrial production in Kobe had almost reached pre - quake levels , and Japan as a whole suffered only one quarter of declining output . 
 A second reason to expect the economy to cope is that although the area affected by the tsunami and quake was vast , it contains no Kobes . It is less populated and less industrialised . According to calculations by economists at Nomura , an investment bank , the three worst - hit prefectures ( Miyagi , Fukushima and Iwate ) account for just 3.6 % of Japan 's economy , though electronics factories are clustered there . 
 Adding in neighbouring Nagano , Ibaraki and Niigata prefectures , which were much less damaged , brings the affected area 's contribution to GDP to 10.8 % . That is a big chunk . But Tomo Kinoshita of Nomura nevertheless estimates that the direct negative hit to Japan 's GDP would be limited to between 0.25 and 0.5 percentage points in the first quarter , and 0.5 and 1 percentage point in the second . Another bank , Goldman Sachs , estimates the cost of the damage at { Yen}16 trillion ( $ 202 billion ) , or about 4 % of GDP . Spread over a few years of reconstruction , that should easily be affordable -- a drop in the ocean of Japanese public indebtedness . 
 However , first guesses about the disaster 's impact have been overtaken by further disasters . The nuclear crisis at Fukushima broadens the economic danger in at least three ways . First , the perceived risk of radiation may close businesses , deter investment and hamper rebuilding . TEPCO , with its shares hammered , now faces worries about its creditworthiness . And selling nuclear - energy technology abroad -- Toshiba , Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries all produce reactors -- is one of the linchpins of Naoto Kan's growth strategy . 
 Second , electricity rationing may keep output depressed for longer than originally anticipated . Only a week after the quake , Tokyo was facing rolling blackouts . And third , the nervous mood makes financial panic more likely . Over three days the Bank of Japan announced plans to inject a total of { Yen}55.6 trillion into financial markets , to avoid a collapse in investor confidence and keep credit flowing . On March 14th and 15th shares on the Tokyo exchange fell by over 16 % , their worst two - day fall since 1987 . They have recovered somewhat since , but the yen also strengthened to record highs against the dollar . A nuclear meltdown may yet lead to a financial one . That would add another international risk -- financial contagion -- to all the other dangers looming over Japan . 
 Supply - chain concerns are mounting as it becomes apparent that more Japanese factories may be closed for longer than first thought , and that a surprising number of gizmos assembled in China , South Korea , Taiwan and elsewhere depend on Japanese components . There were also fears that the price of oil , which at first fell a bit because of an expected drop in Japanese demand , might be driven even higher as Japan makes up for the shortfall in nuclear power , at a time of tensions in north Africa and the Middle East . Phoenix in the east 
 The tasks facing Japan are staggering . But a country does not live on a geological time bomb without some accommodation by the national psyche . The legacy of centuries of rebuilding cities , temples and homes after tsunamis , fires and earthquakes has provided many Japanese with a fatalistic streak . In the past they have often risen to the task of rebuilding ; it provides a sense of national purpose . 
 Twice in the past century , Tokyo has re - emerged out of the rubble . After the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 , in which 143,000 people died , the recovery turned poisonous ; amid the wreckage , sword - wielding Japanese set about wantonly killing Korean immigrants . Democratic shoots were trampled , and nationalistic passions eventually drove Japan to war . Two decades later , in 1945 , destruction came from American bombs . The zeal to rebuild was again remarkable . Within a generation , Japan had turned -- peacefully this time -- from one of the chief recipients of World Bank aid into an industrial superpower . 
 The past 20 years of stagnation and deflation -- albeit with high levels of conspicuous consumption -- have left many yearning for a new sense of purpose . It is perhaps a chilling reflection of this that comments by Shintaro Ishihara , the right - wing governor of Tokyo , harking back to imperial days by calling the disaster "" divine retribution "" for Japan 's culture of "" greed "" , have found some resonance , especially among elderly Japanese . Others will be furious . 
 More thoughtful voices propose more constructive ways to forge a new sense of purpose . Many foreigners have expressed deep admiration for the calm resilience the Japanese have demonstrated this week ( see Banyan ) . A university professor , stuck for 25 hours on a short train journey to Tokyo as a result of the earthquake , wrote a long piece on Facebook about the patience of his fellow passengers , the solicitousness of the railway staff , and the spotless toilets . "" If you have to spend 16 hours in a stationary train and an additional nine hours getting home , do it in Japan , "" he wrote . Japanese people say they take heart from such commendations . 
 As for the future , Hideaki Shiroyama , a public - policy expert at the University of Tokyo , says a big indication of Japan 's willingness to shake off its lethargy will be the inevitable debate on nuclear energy that emerges from the disaster . Part of the public scepticism about the industry , he believes , stems from a regulatory structure that remains mired in the past . The industry is fiercely tribal , and regulators are too close to the utilities . Even before the emergency , he says , calls from within the industry for change went unheard . 
 Similarly , he says Japan 's policy towards rebuilding fishing communities such as Rikuzentakata will be a chance to think creatively . An enlightened response would be for many of the demolished communities to be abandoned for ever , because in Japan 's greying society their residents are mainly pensioners . It would make more sense to rehouse them in higher - density communities closer to shops and hospitals . But even those whose houses have been destroyed by the tsunami are loth to leave -- these are ancestral plots that are meant to stay in the family . And the fishing grounds are rich . Since Japan instinctively solves any economic problem by throwing concrete and dollops of public money at it ( tight as money is ) , the elderly will probably get their way . 
 The rebuilding , as well as the discussion about Japan 's future energy sources , might be easier if the political system encouraged debate and compromise , rather than partisan gridlock . To rebuild Japan , the public spirit shown by citizens in the face of today 's catastrophe needs to inspire the political class , promoting collaboration and unity . As Naoto Kan says , Japan has to pull together . If the earthquake helps Japan repair its social fabric and recover its sense of purpose , it may yet bring something other than tragedy in its wake .

SINCE the lives of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Japanese were turned upside down by earthquake, tsunami, fire and looming nuclear threat, people around the globe have watched, amazed, at the survivors' composure--""stoicism"" is the word they most often reach for. There have been few complaints, just civic-minded initiative. All along the coast, the urgent talk is not just about survival in the face of shortages of food, water and fuel. Stricken communities are desperate to start rebuilding their towns (
).
Stoicism is an admirable response to what fate deals you. It also serves as a coping mechanism in the face of incomprehension. And the Japanese no longer just find it hard to understand how nature could deal such a blow; increasingly, they want to know why the government of a rich and orderly land should be taking so long to tame an overheating nuclear plant and get help to communities ravaged by the tsunami. A lack of water, food and warmth are a fresh and acute source of suffering. Despite the scale of the humanitarian disaster, some of the suffering is avoidable. The system is letting citizens down.
This criticism may seem harsh. For a start, Naoto Kan, the prime minister, has maintained relative calm despite the menacing situation at Fukushima Dai-ichi, the crippled nuclear plant. His government has also been far more transparent than its predecessors. The Bank of Japan acted promptly, providing liquidity to prevent a natural disaster from becoming a financial one.
Favourable comparisons have rightly been made with the bumbling response by an earlier government to the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, which killed 6,400. Then, Japan's government was slower than South Korea's to set up an emergency relief operation. Yakuza, the Japanese mafia, were the first to set up soup kitchens for the victims.
But that is setting the bar very low indeed. After all, the Kobe fiasco hastened the end of the Liberal Democratic Party's post-war supremacy and the rise of Mr Kan's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Kobe showed that the country was run by incompetents. The shock led to soul-searching by a once-confident Japan which, with its economy broken, seemed adrift. Yet all was not lost in the ""lost decade"". Out of Kobe grew new civic-minded energies. Mr Kan himself has a background in civic activism. In 2009 the DPJ promised a new, more accountable kind of politics. A less deferential electorate approved.
Yet, this month's disasters underscore how much more the system still needs to change--along with the politicians guiding it. For one, the fiasco at Fukushima Dai-ichi has revealed, again, the cosy ties between the nuclear industry and government. Together, they have stifled debate, covered up bungles and made assumptions about risks that were too optimistic. The crisis management at TEPCO, the plant's owner, has laid bare an astounding lack of leadership. ""What the hell's going on?"" Mr Kan demanded at one point.
The same might be asked of the operation to get help to the tsunami victims. For all that Mr Kan has attempted to be seen at the front, in Tokyo the sense of a looming humanitarian crisis in the north has been slow to sink in. That is partly because nuclear worries have absorbed much of the government's attention. Few politicians in a centralised system have bothered to travel north themselves. The media, taking their cue from the Tokyo establishment, have not thought properly to report the unfolding struggle for food and fuel.
Yet businessmen and victims say supplies are being held up as bureaucracies fall back on tired old rules and straitjacket procedures. Lorries full of supplies have been unable to get petrol on the empty expressway north, reserved for ""emergency"" vehicles. While this severe shortage of fuel spread through northern Japan, oil companies were sitting on huge supplies which by law they had to keep in reserve. If ever an occasion for their use was justified, it was this catastrophe. Yet the government took ten days to beg for (not order) their release. From the start, Mr Kan should have declared a state of emergency. Even now, clear lines of authority for handling the many-headed crisis have not been properly established. Who the hell's in charge?
Japan has gone without effective leadership for so long, with an endless procession of faceless prime ministers and their cabinets, that it has made political dysfunction look almost like well-practised art. But this crisis has shone a pitiless light on that failure. Mr Kan, who has promised political change, now needs to bring it about. Japan's people can help, adopting a different attitude to their government. Stoicism--however good for coping with adversity--is bad for bringing on change.

EARLY on Sunday, nine days after the port of Kesennuma was turned into a watery, blazing morgue, people are trying to get back to work. A psychiatric nurse is pushing her bike through the mud, hoping to find the main road to the hospital. She can't. It is buried beneath piles of destruction--blackened skeletons of houses, shops with their guts spilled out, burned-out ships tossed half a mile inland.
Out of one deformed structure, a shopkeeper, Kanichi Mogi, emerges with a smile on his face and a computer under his arm. ""My work PC! I found it!"" he shouts.
Nearer the hospital, five men in overalls are winching rubble from the shipyard where they used to make 50 aluminium skiffs a year for the scallop trade. The boats, the foreman boasts softly, are sleek, energy-saving and recyclable. But they are all gone. Instead, a rusty trawler lies on its side on the forecourt, which the workmen eye as though a mongrel dog. Before the tsunami, it floated on the far side of the bay. 
Kesennuma is on the north-eastern coast that bore the brunt of the tsunami on March 11th, leaving at least 25,600 dead or missing. With about 1,000 registered dead in the town, it fared better than nearby Ofunato and Rikuzentakata. But it was thrice blighted. After the earthquake and tsunami, fuel from the fishing boats caught fire, and for four days the port burned.
Unknown numbers of bodies lie amid the ashes, among them Chinese who worked in factories famous in Japan for processing sharks' fins. The tsunami rearranged the town: in the mud beneath a blackened hull lies a string of pearls.
Yet however much people are in turmoil, few mope. A spirit of revival is in the air. When the tsunami struck the psychiatric hospital, staff rushed 250 patients up to the roof to escape floodwaters that reached the third floor. Not even the patients panicked, says the nurse. Soon after she made it back to work on Sunday, a male hairdresser turned up offering to cut the patients' hair.
Nor are these isolated snapshots of public spirit. Almost every leg of a six-hour walk through the wreckage of Kesennuma showed people defiantly attempting to rebuild shattered lives. People expressed thanks for the solidarity the world had shown Japan. They were proud, too, that their indomitable spirit had been recognised. ""Just you come back in ten years' time,"" was the refrain. 
Still, the road out of this mess will be breathtakingly hard. That is not just because it will take many months to dig through a tangle of steel and concrete that stretches for hundreds of kilometres. And put aside the difficulties of choosing whether and how to rebuild on such a treacherous coast.
It is also because Japan has a political system so set in its ways that it has trouble adapting to creeping change, let alone emergencies on a biblical scale. Too often, the flip side of Japan's deference is an establishment able to blunder on without fear of protest and social strife.
This can hardly be missed in Kesennuma. Two men on the roof of a house were tinkering with their small boat that had been left perched by the tsunami. They were draining the outboard motor of fuel, so that they could fill up their car and drive off in search of food. For another disaster, this time largely man-made, has befallen the communities along the coast. A desperate shortage of fuel--and so food and warmth--is compounding the misery felt not only by the 260,000 homeless who have lost all, but also by those whose homes were spared.
And so people camped in refugee shelters in Kesennuma have only rice and hot soup. Red Cross staff say the soup lines are swelling with ""food refugees"", people who may have their homes but have no food, for the shops have run out.
The problem is bewildering. Along a 17-hour drive from Tokyo to Kesennuma, cars snaked in a line out of almost every petrol station. Hundreds of kilometres from the disaster area, restaurants and shops were shut. Petrol-pump attendants said fuel was being diverted to the tsunami-hit coast. Yet in Kesennuma, some waited a whole day and got just a 20-litre ration at the end of it.
For this, bureaucratic inflexibility is partly to blame. Shortly after the tsunami, Kouta Matsuda, an opposition senator and former boss of a nationwide coffee chain, drove a four-tonne lorry to his constituency in Miyagi prefecture, where Kesennuma is located. He had to battle with authorities for permission to use trunk roads that were closed except for emergency vehicles. He said he found plenty of food at his destination, but no means of distributing it to the hardest-hit areas.
Later he used a friend's helicopter to fly food, medicines and mobile-phone chargers to Miyagi, but was refused permission to land. He asked if he could drop the supplies at the airport, hovering just a metre above the ground. Again, he was told this was against the rules.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), which handles fuel distribution, lists many causes of the fuel crisis. Nario Kadono, an official redrafted from the private sector to handle the disaster, notes that the main refinery in the disaster-struck region is crippled, as were five other refineries near Tokyo. Three of those remain out of action. Freight-train services north were suspended for a week. There was also panic buying of petrol as fears about supply mounted. Mr Kadono says METI staff are working around the clock, snatching their brief sleep in the darkened office, where lights are off to save energy.
Yet Mr Kadono acknowledges that because of increased refining elsewhere in Japan, the overall supply of fuel was never short. That makes the fuel queues all the more bewildering. Part of the problem is a law requiring oil companies to keep 70 days' worth of fuel in reserve. It took ten days to relax this to 45 days. The ministry may use only ""administrative guidance"" to encourage companies to release fuel; it cannot order them to do so. It has also been slow in dispatching tanker lorries along the empty highways north.
Mr Matsuda, the senator, says the government should, early on in the crisis, have declared a state of emergency to override the petty regulations that snarl up disaster relief. But he says that even now few politicians are aware of the extent of the shortages along the coast. That may be partly because they are underreported in a national media fixated on what seemed to matter most in Tokyo. When METI briefed parliamentarians this week to reassure them the fuel shortage was being tackled, everyone nodded mutely, Mr Matsuda says.
He argues that the ""vertically structured"" nature of governance in Japan makes strong leadership all the more important. Naoto Kan, the prime minister, has not provided this, though that is not entirely his fault. The government has had more disasters on its hands in two weeks than most governments face in their lifetime. From the start, most of the focus has been on controlling the radiation spewing out of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant, 240km north of Tokyo. Leaks continued even after TEPCO, its owner, restored power to all six stricken reactors.
Mr Kan has also sought to prevent hysteria, a threat which re-emerged on March 23rd when levels of radioactive iodine believed harmful to babies were found in Tokyo's water system (though Japan's standards are unusually strict). Bottled water is now in short supply in Tokyo shops. This has added to fears about the safety of milk, vegetables and seafood found near the reactor. After government assurances, the Japanese, although obsessed with food safety, have remained calm: at lunchtime in Tokyo workers still tuck into vegetable and shrimp tempura. But on March 23rd America became the first foreign country to block imports of produce from the radiation zone. Not for the first time, America seems to be less trusting of assurances about safety than are the Japanese. Other countries have followed suit.
Throughout the nuclear saga, a dose of old-fashioned heroism has lifted the national mood. Firemen and TEPCO workers have volunteered to brave repeated amounts of high radiation to keep water jets playing on overheating fuel rods, and to fix supplies of electricity. After days of begging for help, many citizens stranded in evacuation shelters near the Fukushima plant were bused to Tokyo for refuge. Given the persistence of radiation, albeit only at low levels so far, some worry that they will never return home. Keeping up with the crisis
For the government, the task is to get ahead of the crisis. So far events have left it always looking a day or two behind. What's more, it has been unable to pull together a crisis team, involving experts from business and elsewhere, that might give a sense of leadership on every front of the disaster. Part of the problem is crass intransigence by the opposition. Mr Kan's overtures to opposition politicians for a cabinet of national unity have so far been rejected. Meanwhile, the opposition is still scoring points over next year's proposed budget. Legislation to finance the budget is meeting obstruction, even though more funds will be needed for disaster relief.
Even if the authorities were to take more assured control of the crisis, the short-term problems remain immense. The fuel shortage and rolling power cuts have already crippled industrial production. Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckons GDP could fall at least an annualised 6% from April to June. The car industry, which accounts for a tenth of industrial output, has stalled, partly because the disaster knocked out plants making vital micro-controllers. Toyota, which pioneered the process of running just-in-time inventory systems, idled all its domestic plants for lack of parts or resins. 
The staggered power cuts are also proving ill-conceived. Interrupting power even for a few hours sometimes forces factories to shut all day, says the boss of a large chemical firm. After a shutdown it can take hours to recalibrate machinery.
For all that, quiet confidence is growing among businessmen that Japan will rebuild itself. UBS, a bank, predicts that finding energy-saving technologies to counter the potential loss of nuclear power will imbue Japan with a new creative mission. 
And in Kesennuma, too, a diamond-edged business spirit is starting to take hold again. An entrepreneurial young grocer who had lost his home and shop had set up a market stall out of a pick-up truck. He was doing a brisk trade selling fruit to people who had been without fresh food for more than a week. The smile on his face looked familiar. It was Mr Mogi, the man who just a few hours earlier had rescued his precious computer, with all his customer records on it, from his flattened house. ""Gambarimasu,"" he said: We'll try our best.

Nario Kadono , an official redrafted from the private sector to handle the disaster , notes that the main refinery in the disaster - struck region is crippled , as were five other refineries near Tokyo . Three of those remain out of action . Freight - train services north were suspended for a week . There was also panic buying of petrol as fears about supply mounted . Mr Kadono says METI staff are working around the clock , snatching their brief sleep in the darkened office , where lights are off to save energy . 
 Yet Mr Kadono acknowledges that because of increased refining elsewhere in Japan , the overall supply of fuel was never short . That makes the fuel queues all the more bewildering . Part of the problem is a law requiring oil companies to keep 70 days ' worth of fuel in reserve . It took ten days to relax this to 45 days . The ministry may use only "" administrative guidance "" to encourage companies to release fuel ; it can not order them to do so . It has also been slow in dispatching tanker lorries along the empty highways north . 
 Mr Matsuda , the senator , says the government should , early on in the crisis , have declared a state of emergency to override the petty regulations that snarl up disaster relief . But he says that even now few politicians are aware of the extent of the shortages along the coast . That may be partly because they are underreported in a national media fixated on what seemed to matter most in Tokyo . When METI briefed parliamentarians this week to reassure them the fuel shortage was being tackled , everyone nodded mutely , Mr Matsuda says . 
 He argues that the "" vertically structured "" nature of governance in Japan makes strong leadership all the more important . Naoto Kan has not provided this , though that is not entirely Naoto Kan's fault . The government has had more disasters on its hands in two weeks than most governments face in their lifetime . From the start , most of the focus has been on controlling the radiation spewing out of the Fukushima Dai - ichi nuclear - power plant , 240 km north of Tokyo . Leaks continued even after TEPCO , its owner , restored power to all six stricken reactors . 
 Naoto Kan has also sought to prevent hysteria , a threat which re - emerged on March 23rd when levels of radioactive iodine believed harmful to babies were found in Tokyo 's water system ( though Japan 's standards are unusually strict ) . Bottled water is now in short supply in Tokyo shops . This has added to fears about the safety of milk , vegetables and seafood found near the reactor . After government assurances , the Japanese , although obsessed with food safety , have remained calm : at lunchtime in Tokyo workers still tuck into vegetable and shrimp tempura . But on March 23rd America became the first foreign country to block imports of produce from the radiation zone . Not for the first time , America seems to be less trusting of assurances about safety than are the Japanese . Other countries have followed suit . 
 Throughout the nuclear saga , a dose of old - fashioned heroism has lifted the national mood . Firemen and TEPCO workers have volunteered to brave repeated amounts of high radiation to keep water jets playing on overheating fuel rods , and to fix supplies of electricity . After days of begging for help , many citizens stranded in evacuation shelters near the Fukushima plant were bused to Tokyo for refuge . Given the persistence of radiation , albeit only at low levels so far , some worry that they will never return home . Keeping up with the crisis 
 For the government , the task is to get ahead of the crisis . So far events have left it always looking a day or two behind . What 's more , it has been unable to pull together a crisis team , involving experts from business and elsewhere , that might give a sense of leadership on every front of the disaster . Part of the problem is crass intransigence by the opposition . Naoto Kan's overtures to opposition politicians for a cabinet of national unity have so far been rejected . Meanwhile , the opposition is still scoring points over next year 's proposed budget . Legislation to finance the budget is meeting obstruction , even though more funds will be needed for disaster relief . 
 Even if the authorities were to take more assured control of the crisis , the short - term problems remain immense . The fuel shortage and rolling power cuts have already crippled industrial production . Morgan Stanley , a bank , reckons GDP could fall at least an annualised 6 % from April to June . The car industry , which accounts for a tenth of industrial output , has stalled , partly because the disaster knocked out plants making vital micro - controllers . Toyota , which pioneered the process of running just - in - time inventory systems , idled all its domestic plants for lack of parts or resins . 
 The staggered power cuts are also proving ill - conceived . Interrupting power even for a few hours sometimes forces factories to shut all day , says the boss of a large chemical firm . After a shutdown it can take hours to recalibrate machinery . 
 For all that , quiet confidence is growing among businessmen that Japan will rebuild itself . UBS , a bank , predicts that finding energy - saving technologies to counter the potential loss of nuclear power will imbue Japan with a new creative mission . 
 And in Kesennuma , too , a diamond - edged business spirit is starting to take hold again . An entrepreneurial young grocer who had lost his home and shop had set up a market stall out of a pick - up truck . He was doing a brisk trade selling fruit to people who had been without fresh food for more than a week . The smile on his face looked familiar . It was Mr Mogi , the man who just a few hours earlier had rescued his precious computer , with all his customer records on it , from his flattened house . "" Gambarimasu , "" he said : We 'll try our best .

IT IS daylight, but the darkness inside the headquarters of the world's biggest privately owned electricity company is sepulchral. Officials, heads bowed, apologise in whispers for the trouble Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) has caused. Their 66-year-old boss, Masataka Shimizu, went into hospital on March 30th, suffering from hypertension; he has been absent for much of the past three weeks. In the gloom TEPCO's logo on the walls of the building resembles a mutant Mickey Mouse.
About 250km away, at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant, hundreds of TEPCO employees and some subcontractors are trying to prevent further leaks of radioactive material from three damaged nuclear reactors and various sources of spent fuel. Their conditions are close to intolerable. At times, they have been exposed to more radiation in a few hours than they are supposed to endure in a year. Their rations are biscuits and canned food. They have a blanket each, and sleep on the floor. Some have lost homes and families to the tsunami that left 27,690 dead or missing. TEPCO sees them as soldiers. ""We don't think they are heroes. They are doing what they should,"" an official says.
TEPCO is getting most of the blame for Japan's nuclear disaster. For much of the past three weeks, the authorities have held out hopes that they could regain control by reconnecting cooling systems damaged by the tsunami. These are supposed to prevent fuel from melting and rupturing the protective steel case of the reactor vessels.
This week the discovery of large pools of highly radioactive water and raised levels of radiation in seawater near the plant has shown how far the authorities really are from regaining control. Previous releases of radioactive iodine and caesium had shown that material from the core of at least one reactor has been released. The new findings suggest that the systems designed to contain such releases may have been badly compromised. The tanks into which contaminated water is being pumped will eventually fill up. And conditions for workers are getting more dangerous, which means that fixing up the cooling systems and hooking up vital measuring instruments takes longer.
The plant is so woefully damaged that TEPCO officials cannot say when the crisis will be over. Levels of radiation have mostly been subsiding, though unevenly spread. But reports on March 31st revealed that radiation in a village 40km away exceeded criteria for evacuation and the UN's nuclear watchdog suggested the government might widen the 20km evacuation zone. All this has compounded worries that the area round the plant may remain unsafe for years.
There is plenty of blame to go around. TEPCO wrongly measured radiated waters in one of the turbine halls at 10m times normal level, rather than the still-alarming 100,000 times. Subcontractors working for TEPCO reportedly complained about the safety of their workers on site. Three electricians accidentally stepped into a dangerous puddle on March 24th. In one sign of unpreparedness, the gauge that measured the radioactivity of water afterwards could not go higher than 1,000 millisieverts an hour, about the level at which radiation becomes an immediate threat to health.
Tensions between TEPCO and the government of Naoto Kan have risen since the prime minister installed crisis managers inside the utility's head office. Privately, officials have suggested TEPCO may have been slow to use seawater to cool the reactors because it wanted to save its plant--though the company denies this. Publicly, Mr Kan has lambasted the company's tsunami-preparedness. Koichiro Gemba, a cabinet minister, has left open the possibility that TEPCO would be nationalised, though this was perhaps to reassure voters in his Fukushima district that they would be adequately compensated. Other officials were non-committal about state intervention, but TEPCO shares have fallen by over 75% since March 11th.
Outside experts say that repeated flaws in the company's nuclear operations have denuded its board of specialists in atomic power. Mr Shimizu is the third successive president to have been hit by a nuclear accident. ""This company is really rotten to the core,"" says Kenichi Ohmae, a management consultant and former nuclear engineer. He blames TEPCO for storing too much spent fuel on the site; for placing too many reactors in the same place (there are six in the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant and seven in a nuclear complex on an earthquake fault-line in Niigata); and for not having enough varied sources of power.
But the problems run deeper than TEPCO. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) oversees the regulator and is responsible for safety issues. But it also promotes the nuclear industry. Reportedly, Mr Kan is considering altering this. Nuclear scientists, says Mr Ohmae, are mostly sponsored by utilities, compromising their independence. He describes them as ""Christmas-tree decorations"" on government safety commissions. 
The problems compound one another. Taro Kono, of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), says there is an ""unholy triangle"" between METI, its affiliated regulator and the nuclear industry. His office notes that Toru Ishida, a former METI energy official, moved straight into a job as senior adviser to TEPCO. Mr Kono also accuses the media of being in the nuclear industry's pocket, because of lashings of advertising.
Paul Scalise, a TEPCO expert at Temple University's Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies in Japan, responds that the demonising happens, in part, so that politicians, bureaucrats and the electorate can avoid blame themselves. He points out that Japan's embrace of nuclear technology was a national decision, taken after the 1973 oil shock (Japan imports 99% of its oil). But after accidents at Three-Mile Island and Chernobyl, local people began to take a not-in-my-back-yard attitude. Utilities and the government responded by offering tax incentives, subsidies and other blandishments. The result was some of the highest electricity tariffs in the rich world.
Yet companies like TEPCO have still struggled to build new plants in the teeth of local opposition, Mr Scalise says. That helps explain why so many of its reactors are on single sites. The company stores spent fuel rods on its premises because there is no consensus on where else to put them. Meanwhile, the shortage of capacity means that its margin of excess power has been shrinking for 20 years.
Following the earthquake and tsunami, about 28% of TEPCO's installed capacity, nuclear and non-nuclear, remains shut down. On March 30th, the government acknowledged the obvious--that it is likely to decommission the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant permanently--and possibly have to cover it to stop radiation leaking out. That would knock out about 1.8% of Japan's energy capacity. In a model of bad planning, the country's power-distribution systems in the east and west of the country operate on different frequencies, so it is hard to share electricity between them. Unless damaged thermal-electric capacity is brought back soon and more small gas-fired plants are quickly built, months--perhaps years--of energy shortages loom, with crippling effects on the economy.
All this will be a reason to judge TEPCO severely. But the crisis is exposing the failure of the nation's energy policy as a whole. Prices are exorbitantly high. Power generation produces more greenhouse gases than the government wants. The country has not achieved its goal of nuclear self-sufficiency by reprocessing spent fuel. And now it has a nuclear disaster on its hands. That is not only TEPCO's fault. It is Japan's. If the country wants a more reliable energy strategy, it will have to start by acknowledging its collective failings.","Japan 's nuclear crisis drags on , exposing profound failures both at the company and in national energy policy

A PEN-LIKE dosimeter hangs around the neck of Katsunobu Sakurai, the tireless mayor of Minamisoma, measuring the accumulated radiation to which he has been exposed during the past two weeks of a four-week nuclear nightmare. The reading of 43 microsieverts is about the dosage he would get from a single chest x-ray. No cause for alarm, then. Yet he believes the radioactive particles from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant, 25km from his office, have led this once-prosperous city of 70,000 into a fight for its life.
About 50,000 inhabitants who lived closest to the plant have been evacuated or have fled since radiation levels started to rise after the March 11th tsunami--which also left at least 1,400 of the town's residents dead or missing. Even though external radiation has since returned to near-harmless levels, Mr Sakurai fears many of Minamisoma's evacuees may never come back.
Three worries predominate. One, the information passed out by the government and Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), which owns the Dai-ichi plant, may be unreliable. Two, the plant is still unstable, at risk of suddenly emitting vastly greater amounts of radioactive particles. Three, the longer it takes to stabilise, the more lasting damage wind- and waterborne radiation may do to the livelihoods of the farmers and fishermen who are the economic lifeblood of the community. If they go, so does the town.
These worries resurfaced on April 7th when TEPCO started to inject nitrogen into one of the plant's six stricken reactors. That was to prevent a repeat of the hydrogen explosions that blew radiation out of the plant soon after cooling systems failed in the wake of the tsunami.
Even before that news, Mr Sakurai was saying that he was fearful of another explosion. It was why he continued to discourage hope that the town could get back to normal. ""The lack of information is making people deeply stressed and frustrated,"" he said.
The prompt dissemination of accurate information is not happening, though. By April 6th TEPCO had managed to staunch the leakage of highly contaminated water from one of the damaged reactors that had produced levels of radioactive iodine 7.5m times the legal limit in one sample of seawater. But that was not before fishermen about 70km south of the plant had caught tiny sand-eels, known as konago, with larger than normal traces of radioactive iodine and caesium. The unwelcome discovery prompted Naoto Kan, the prime minister, to issue a new safety standard for levels of radioactivity in marine products. Knowing the public's fears of unsafe food (and no doubt encouraged by the promise of compensation), the local konago fishermen had already pulled in their nets for the season.
The fear of contamination is spreading internationally, too, and the government is learning that it is not enough just to present scientific evidence about radiation levels. On April 6th India suspended all Japanese food imports. Neighbouring South Korea expressed concern that it was not warned about TEPCO's decision to dump low-level radioactive waste into the sea to make room to store more toxic stuff on land. South Korea does not share a sea with Fukushima. But South Korea, like Japan, has a vibrant seafood culture. Rational or not, perceptions matter.
With more emotion than sense, electronic components, machine parts and even towels made far from Fukushima have required radiation checks or been turned back by Italy and China, among others. The Japanese authorities have not helped by falling back on technocracy rather than a more sympathetic response. Shippers have urged the government to issue certificates that would assure foreign ports that goods are radiation-free. Instead, Japan expends its energies mainly attempting to convince shippers about the safely low levels of radiation in the country at large. ""The question is how to reduce anxiety, not present science,"" says Katsunori Nemoto of Keidanren, Japan's business lobby.
At a time when the Japanese economy needs help, to date around 50 countries have imposed restrictions on Japanese imports. America, which buys one-sixth of Japanese farm exports, has put products from Fukushima and three other prefectures on a watch list. The European Union has named a dozen prefectures that need radiation tests, yet traders in these places report a lack of testing equipment. In one case, says an executive at a Japanese trading house, tuna that arrived in America was set aside by customs, rotting before it was inspected. A sake brewer on a sales trip to Las Vegas noticed that Japanese food was off the menu at hotels.
So far the direct economic impact of radiation fears on exports is slight. Fishing and farming account for a very small part of Japan's total exports, even if a disproportionate share in Japan's stricken north-east. Even so, the reputation for high quality enjoyed by Japanese-sourced food will probably suffer. 
At home, the impact on domestic demand may be much bigger. Economists say fears of radiation dampen consumer confidence and extend as far south as Tokyo, which is 250km from the Fukushima plant. Some pundits want the government to launch a publicity blitz to urge ordinary Japanese to spend more. It may do little good, especially coming from a government that does not inspire confidence. Many ordinary Japanese unaffected by the tsunami and nuclear mess either feel a sympathy for the victims or are ashamed to be seen enjoying themselves. The Japanese tendency towards self-restraint, or jishuku, is back in force. People are cutting back on everything from shopping trips to hanami parties to view the spring cherry blossom.
As for Minamisoma, its residents are fed up with paying the price for a nuclear accident at a plant that brought them little benefit--after all, it sent nearly all its electricity to Tokyo. Takashi Shibaguchi, a 41-year-old acupuncturist who lived on the outskirts of the town, says he will never return home, even though he has no money and is sleeping on the floor of an evacuation shelter with his wife and four-year-old daughter. He is rational about the radiation risks to himself, but fears his daughter growing up in such a potentially poisonous environment. ""I'm done with it,"" he says.

AS JAPAN copes with its worst crisis since the second world war, the prime minister, Naoto Kan, is calling for a new politics. In particular, he wants collaboration with opposition parties mostly bent on ousting him. ""Many ways of doing things in this country have come to the end of the road,"" he said on April 11th. ""To rebuild this country, we need a new mindset. I hope for--and expect--a new direction.""
He seems unlikely to get it. The quake and tsunami that devastated north-eastern Japan, and the nuclear disaster that followed, have disrupted the economy, with power shortages and stricken factories. Ordinary Japanese have cut back on inessential spending, in a mood of sacrificial restraint. Much has changed. Yet one constant remains: petty political bickering.
As the government has attempted to deal with the mess, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has picked on minor gaffes to justify exaggerated displays of outrage. Mr Kan's offer to the LDP's leader, Sadakazu Tanigaki, to form a ""grand coalition"" with his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) was rebuffed. The opposition thinks Mr Kan is flailing and his prime ministership, which was in trouble well before the earthquake, is in danger.
In opinion polls, Mr Kan's personal support has increased slightly since then, but around two-thirds of voters are disappointed with the government's handling of the crisis, particularly at the Fukushima nuclear plant. On April 12th the nuclear accident there was upgraded to level seven, the highest rating on an international scale of severity. That places it on a par with the Chernobyl disaster 25 years ago this month (though the radiation released at Fukushima is only a tenth of Chernobyl's, and nobody has died from it yet). 
On April 10th the DPJ's troubles took their toll in regional and local elections. The party lost all three of its races for prefectural governorships to the LDP. It failed to gain a plurality in any of 41 prefectural and municipal assemblies that were up for grabs. The drubbing has emboldened LDP politicians to resist more collaboration. As ever, they aim to oust Mr Kan and precipitate an early general election.
A semblance of political co-operation may last only until a second round of local elections on April 24th. It leaves just enough time to pass the first of many proposed disaster-relief bills. Some {Yen}4 trillion (around $48 billion) will go towards rebuilding, as well as helping tsunami victims and farmers and fishermen whose businesses have been hurt. 
Later bills will be the source of fresh squabbles. The opposition will urge the DPJ to abandon pledges to introduce a child-support allowance and eliminate toll-road fees. Although the DPJ used these campaign pledges in 2009 to help defeat the LDP after a half-century in power, they are only mildly popular now. People know they will push Japan ever deeper into debt. 
Complicating Mr Kan's position is the make-up of his own party. The DPJ is stuffed with backbenchers loyal to Ichiro Ozawa, an old-timer who resigned from the party leadership because of a fund-raising scandal but who still undermines Mr Kan. The prime minister has to cut his cloth to suit Mr Ozawa's gang.
The LDP is hardly in better shape. Few people believe it would have handled the many-headed catastrophe any more adroitly. And they know that the LDP's long dominance in some ways prepared the way for the crisis. For instance, weak regulation of the nuclear-power industry allowed old, ill-supervised reactors such as those at the Fukushima plant to remain in service.
The party is beset by internal conflict. The dinosaurs see little need to revitalise the party's appeal or methods. Indeed, post-tsunami reconstruction, they think, is a way to dole out public-works contracts, just as in the old days. Younger members think this is why politicians and voters who over the years grew disenchanted with the LDP are not returning to the fold. According to a recent poll in the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, half of Japan's public supports neither party.","Political co - operation , hard before the earthquake and tsunami , has got harder

IN A nation of stoics, the most patient sufferers--by common consent--are those from Tohoku, the poor north-eastern area struck by earthquake and tsunami on March 11th. The best-known poem by the region's most beloved poet, Kenji Miyazawa (born in 1896), starts ""Be not defeated by the rain"". It extols the virtues of enduring harsh conditions with good grace. Rarely can Miyazawa's fellow northerners have faced such a test of true grit. Yet the worry is that the longer they suffer in silence, the less they will act as a spur for revival in Japan. 
In the past week three developments have cast doubt on the usefulness of Japan's prevailing attitude of gaman, or endurance. First, on April 17th Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) laid out a nebulous six-to-nine-month plan to bring its damaged Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant to a state of cold shutdown, in which it stops leaking radioactive matter. That is a long time for northern Japan to remain in radiation limbo. Yet there is no grand plan for dealing with the tens of thousands of evacuees--many in their 70s and 80s--from towns near Fukushima who are living in temporary shelters. They have been told by the central government that they may be able to return home once the nuclear situation stabilises, though many are understandably dubious about that possibility.
Some evacuees feel that if they move outside their prefecture, they will lose benefits and links to their communities. Families have been broken up by dysfunctional policies, such as evacuating pregnant women and young children, but not fathers and older children. Indebted farmers and business people have not been offered debt relief by the banks, though they have lost all sources of income. There are innumerable stories of personal hardship. Yet in the absence of concerted local pressure for financial support from Tokyo, the central government appears stuck in the comforting rituals of parliamentary squabbling with a myopic opposition. 
Second, on April 14th Naoto Kan, the prime minister, inaugurated a 15-member task force that aims to develop a ""New Tohoku Model"" for rebuilding stricken areas. This may not be enough to head off rising frustration. North of Fukushima, the biggest challenge is rebuilding tsunami-destroyed areas in a way that makes them safe, economically successful and compact enough to benefit the many elderly residents who live there. Again, locals speak of their need for housing and places to work, but their communities have not organised to press those claims. The new task force has solid local representation. But it hardly sounded reassuring when Makoto Iokibe, who heads the panel, spoke dreamily on its first day of creating ""Hills of Hope"" on which to site the new towns.
A third area in need of public debate is energy policy. This ranges from the future of nuclear power, to the conflicts of interest between regulators and utilities, to the dysfunctional state of the national power grid. West and east Japan are unable to share electricity because of different transmission frequencies dating back more than a century. Conservation will help (see next story). But it will not allay the sense of unease. Thousands have gathered in anti-nuclear protests in Tokyo and elsewhere. An opinion poll by Asahi Shimbun, a national newspaper, showed that the percentage of those opposed to nuclear energy has risen to 41% from 28% in 2007 (women are the strongest opponents), though the share favouring the nuclear status quo barely fell from 53% to 51%. 
But despite the protests, there have been few signs of real debate. And debate is important, because however much Japan stands to lose without nuclear power, it also needs to settle long-term structural issues, such as where to dispose of nuclear waste, and whether old plants such as Fukushima (started in 1971) should be replaced by newer ones. 
In an article published in American newspapers on April 15th, Mr Kan said the crisis would reinvigorate energy policy and create a more vibrant nation. But for that to happen, Japan needs new voices to speak out. On the Tokyo Tower, a steel structure that dominates the capital's skyline, a lit-up message says Ganbaro Nippon--""Keep it up, Japan""--a phrase that smacks of heads-down endurance, rather than the hope of better things to come. People in Tohoku are beginning to resent the phrase, because it sounds like a demand to endure even more. If they are finally running out of gaman, it might be a healthy sign.","The world has admired Japan 's stoic spirit . But there is a worrying side to it

IMMEDIATELY after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11th that crippled reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, all but one of the devices to measure radioactive matter in the area were knocked out. So the authorities in Tokyo sent up a vehicle stuffed with gauges to assess how dangerous the leakage was.
Bewilderingly, says Goshi Hosono, a politician recently appointed to oversee Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO, the utility that runs the plant), the vehicle got stuck in traffic. It then ran out of petrol at a time when the tsunami had led to a nationwide shortage of fuel. Because of this, the government abandoned the mission. Later, the government declared the Fukushima incident to be on the same level of seriousness as the accident at Chernobyl 25 years ago. Yet it had taken what Mr Hosono says was seven to ten days before the government could get reliable data on the amount of radioactive matter pouring out. During that period it became clear that a partial meltdown had taken place in at least one of the six reactors.
Such stories may leave people aghast over how haphazard has been the response to Japan's nuclear mess. After all, at the time even journalists driving close to Fukushima were able to get petrol on the main highways. Still, to date no concrete accusations suggest that the prime minister, Naoto Kan, has comprehensively mishandled the daunting array of disasters that together make up the biggest challenge Japan has faced since the second world war. Ordinary people have a growing perception that Mr Kan easily loses his temper and they do not like that, says Koichi Nakano of Sophia University. ""But there have been no clear examples where his action has been terribly damaging."" 
For all that, politicians from within his own party, as well as the opposition, are plotting to oust Mr Kan. It is yet one more indication, if any were needed, of how alarmingly self-absorbed are Japan's political classes.
On April 26th Yukio Hatoyama, a former prime minister, held a forum of 64 anti-Kan parliamentarians from the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). In fewer than nine months in office, Mr Hatoyama proved an abysmal prime minister. Since his resignation, he seems to have cast aside those memories to grow increasingly resentful of his successor. He called his forum a ""Harmonious Solidarity for the Grand Coalition to Tackle the Earthquake Disaster"". Far from promoting harmony, its implicit aim was to foster a coup within the party against Mr Kan.
Meanwhile, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, which ruled for much of the half-century to 2009 and thus bears a large share of the responsibility for lax safety standards in the nuclear-power industry, is also seeking Mr Kan's early resignation. It may pursue a censure motion in parliament with other opposition parties. 
All this, even though the public shows no enthusiasm for yet another revolving-door prime minister. To all but the political classes engaged in plotting, a leadership struggle for its own sake at a time when the focus should be on dealing with nuclear and humanitarian concerns seems crazy. None of the main parties has offered a compelling alternative for how to recover from the disaster. This includes the DPJ. Far from using the crisis as an opportunity to push for reform, the party's secretary-general, Katsuya Okada, says things should ""settle down"" before the party proposes rebuilding initiatives, new energy policies and a rise in the consumption tax to pay for reconstruction.
All is not hopeless, however. On April 26th Makoto Iokibe and Jun Iio, the two (non-government) leaders of Mr Kan's new Reconstruction Design Council, laid out their early thoughts on how to rebuild Tohoku, the shattered north-eastern region of Japan's main island where almost 26,000 have died or remain missing, presumed drowned. Though they believe it will take at least a decade to recover, their vision, especially compared with the lack of it in politics, is daring. They want to let locals play the main role in reshaping their blighted communities; rebuild in ways that suit elderly residents; use ideas from business and abroad; and limit the influence of the government in Tokyo, which they believe dangerously overcentralises decision-making. Japan's usual way of doing things, Mr Iio insisted, was not up to meeting challenges on this scale. 
The same day, Mr Kan announced his decision to appoint an investigative panel into the Fukushima chain of accidents. Nuclear officials believe Japan needs a quick and thorough investigation, including international experts, if it is to gauge the safety of other nuclear plants. In particular, it will have to look into what happened on the night after the tsunami, when there was a delay in ""venting"" pressure building up in one reactor. Officials worry most about the Hamaoka plant in Shizuoka prefecture, which is reckoned to pose the greatest risk to Tokyo should a quake strike nearer the capital. Hamaoka is of a similar type and age to Fukushima Dai-ichi.
But whether the reconstruction council and nuclear investigation promote deep changes in the way things are done in Japan rests largely on the prime minister's powers of leadership. Only Mr Kan can make sure that the good ideas which emerge do not sink into the Tokyo swamp of bureaucrats and politicians. With some of his party against him, and the opposition unco-operative, it is not even clear that Mr Kan will get emergency budgets approved by the Diet, let alone be able to promote decentralisation and sound energy initiatives. It might help if ordinary citizens spoke out strongly for change. But apart from sporadic protests against TEPCO in the past week, they have yet to make their voices heard above the petty politicians.","A precarious future for the country , but its politicians are self - absorbed

 Bewilderingly , says Goshi Hosono , a politician recently appointed to oversee Tokyo Electric Power ( TEPCO , the utility that runs the plant ) , the vehicle got stuck in traffic . It then ran out of petrol at a time when the tsunami had led to a nationwide shortage of fuel . Because of this , the government abandoned the mission . Later , the government declared the Fukushima incident to be on the same level of seriousness as the accident at Chernobyl 25 years ago . Yet it had taken what Mr Hosono says was seven to ten days before the government could get reliable data on the amount of radioactive matter pouring out . During that period it became clear that a partial meltdown had taken place in at least one of the six reactors . 
 Such stories may leave people aghast over how haphazard has been the response to Japan 's nuclear mess . After all , at the time even journalists driving close to Fukushima were able to get petrol on the main highways . Still , to date no concrete accusations suggest that Naoto Kan , has comprehensively mishandled the daunting array of disasters that together make up the biggest challenge Japan has faced since the second world war . Ordinary people have a growing perception that Naoto Kan easily loses Naoto Kan's temper and they do not like that , says Koichi Nakano of Sophia University . "" But there have been no clear examples where Naoto Kan's action has been terribly damaging . "" 
 For all that , politicians from within Naoto Kan's own party , as well as the opposition , are plotting to oust Naoto Kan It is yet one more indication , if any were needed , of how alarmingly self - absorbed are Japan 's political classes . 
 On April 26th Yukio Hatoyama , a former prime minister , held a forum of 64 anti - Naoto Kan parliamentarians from the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) . In fewer than nine months in office , Mr Hatoyama proved an abysmal prime minister . Since his resignation , he seems to have cast aside those memories to grow increasingly resentful of Naoto Kan's . He called his forum a "" Harmonious Solidarity for the Grand Coalition to Tackle the Earthquake Disaster "" . Far from promoting harmony , its implicit aim was to foster a coup within the party against Naoto Kan 
 Meanwhile , the opposition Liberal Democratic Party , which ruled for much of the half - century to 2009 and thus bears a large share of the responsibility for lax safety standards in the nuclear - power industry , is also seeking Naoto Kan's early resignation . It may pursue a censure motion in parliament with other opposition parties . 
 All this , even though the public shows no enthusiasm for yet another revolving - door prime minister . To all but the political classes engaged in plotting , a leadership struggle for its own sake at a time when the focus should be on dealing with nuclear and humanitarian concerns seems crazy . None of the main parties has offered a compelling alternative for how to recover from the disaster . This includes the DPJ . Far from using the crisis as an opportunity to push for reform , the party 's secretary - general , Katsuya Okada , says things should "" settle down "" before the party proposes rebuilding initiatives , new energy policies and a rise in the consumption tax to pay for reconstruction . 
 All is not hopeless , however . On April 26th Makoto Iokibe and Jun Iio , the two ( non - government ) leaders of Naoto Kan's new Reconstruction Design Council , laid out their early thoughts on how to rebuild Tohoku , the shattered north - eastern region of Japan 's main island where almost 26,000 have died or remain missing , presumed drowned . Though they believe it will take at least a decade to recover , their vision , especially compared with the lack of it in politics , is daring . They want to let locals play the main role in reshaping their blighted communities ; rebuild in ways that suit elderly residents ; use ideas from business and abroad ; and limit the influence of the government in Tokyo , which they believe dangerously overcentralises decision - making . Japan 's usual way of doing things , Mr Iio insisted , was not up to meeting challenges on this scale . 
 The same day , Naoto Kan announced Naoto Kan's decision to appoint an investigative panel into the Fukushima chain of accidents . Nuclear officials believe Japan needs a quick and thorough investigation , including international experts , if it is to gauge the safety of other nuclear plants . In particular , it will have to look into what happened on the night after the tsunami , when there was a delay in "" venting "" pressure building up in one reactor . Officials worry most about the Hamaoka plant in Shizuoka prefecture , which is reckoned to pose the greatest risk to Tokyo should a quake strike nearer the capital . Hamaoka is of a similar type and age to Fukushima Dai - ichi . 
 But whether the reconstruction council and nuclear investigation promote deep changes in the way things are done in Japan rests largely on Naoto Kan's powers of leadership . Naoto Kan can make sure that the good ideas which emerge do not sink into the Tokyo swamp of bureaucrats and politicians . With some of Naoto Kan's party against Naoto Kan , and the opposition unco - operative , it is not even clear that Naoto Kan will get emergency budgets approved by the Diet , let alone be able to promote decentralisation and sound energy initiatives . It might help if ordinary citizens spoke out strongly for change . But apart from sporadic protests against TEPCO in the past week , they have yet to make their voices heard above the petty politicians .",740,Japan,A30-187,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Naoto Kan",18,True

FOR the past few years the zeitgeist in Japan has been about ""grass-eating men"", those young herbivores who eschew the salaryman's role of their fathers and prefer shopping to sex. Two months after nuclear disaster struck, the buzzword has become setsuden, or energy saving. With power in Tokyo in short supply, people take pride in walking up stairs from the underground because the escalators are off. Summer dress codes in government and other offices have begun a month early to save on air conditioning. Unusually for a Japanese politician, Naoto Kan, the embattled prime minister, has even caught the national mood.
On the back foot since the March 11th quake and tsunami, Mr Kan shocked the nuclear industry on May 6th when he called for the temporary closure of Hamaoka nuclear-power plant, an ageing facility on a tectonic fault line that would pose a tremendous risk for Tokyo if it suffered the same fate as the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant. After three days of prevarication, Chubu Electric, the plant's operator, reluctantly agreed to a shutdown.
The head of Japan's business lobby called Mr Kan's decision a piece of theatre that would harm industry nearby, including factories run by Honda and Toyota. Others considered it astute. The prime minister appeared to be rediscovering his roots in civic activism.
On May 10th Mr Kan shocked the nuclear tribe again by announcing his intention to rewrite from scratch a blueprint, scarcely a year old, that planned roughly to double nuclear power's contribution, accounting for half of Japan's energy mix by 2030. His remarks were unscripted and gave no indication he wanted nuclear energy to be abandoned altogether. Further, last year's plan was unfeasibly lofty. Still, in calling on Japan to focus more on renewable energy, the government has demoted nuclear energy as its priority, says Andrew DeWit of Tokyo's Rikkyo University. 
It is unclear what will replace it, however. Thanks to post-earthquake shutdowns, the nuclear fleet is operating at just 44% of capacity. Brownouts this summer might weaken people's anti-nuclear zeal. Winning support for renewable energy will be hard after years of carpet bombing by the pro-nuclear lobby. It has even portrayed geothermal energy in this volcanic land as a threat, since it might pollute the country's beloved onsen, or hot springs. But without renewables, Japan's carbon footprint looks set to grow.
Mr Kan is clear that nuclear power should remain a part of Japan's energy mix, but that it should be safer, better regulated and part of a more imaginative energy policy. For that, though, he must break the utilities' suffocating regional monopolies. So far, he has not sounded nearly bold enough for that.","Naoto Kan seeks to tap into the nation 's energy - saving mood

THERE is something awe-inspiring about the Japanese on a mission. During Golden Week holidays this month, thousands of volunteers helped to sift through the muddy wreckage left by the March tsunami. Stricken roads, bullet trains and factories have returned to normal with astonishing speed. In people's ardour to rebuild, once-taboo ideas are emerging on how to reform and deregulate not just the damaged areas but the country at large (
). The government urgently needs to develop a sense of mission, too.
The combined power of a quake, tsunami and full-scale nuclear accident has jolted whatever sense of complacency the Japanese had about the resilience of their country. The ham-fisted efforts of Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) to stem the crisis at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant have exposed the company for what it is: an inept monopoly so big it could co-opt or run rings around its regulators. It should be broken up. Meanwhile, the smashed-up fishing fleets and sea-swamped rice paddies in the north-east have prompted discussion on bringing private investment into these heavily protected areas which no longer provide a future for the young. Many are championing the idea of special economic zones in the north-east, which would free the area from the cat's cradle of rules imposed from Tokyo that hamper free enterprise. All of these are good ideas. But they will wither unless the central government throws its weight squarely behind them.
For much of the crisis, Naoto Kan, the prime minister, has been a sadly withdrawn figure. Yet when he does show leadership, the public responds. His popularity, though low, rose this month after he unexpectedly pressed for the closure of the nuclear-power plant nearest to Tokyo because it sits on a fault line. He has won plaudits for suspending plans to build more nuclear facilities. No doubt he could do more to accelerate an emergency {Yen}10 trillion ($123 billion) plan for rebuilding damaged parts of the Tohoku region if he were not faced by a ""Bring Down Kan"" campaign within the opposition and even his own party. But he must get around such pettiness. Carpe Diet
To do so, Mr Kan needs to craft a message as substantial as the challenges Tohoku faces. And he needs debate on it to ring out beyond the corridors of power. There are a few encouraging signs. As TEPCO's compensation liabilities mount, Mr Kan is airing the once-unthinkable suggestion that it should be broken up. The government may end up on the hook for many of its liabilities, but a break-up could help spur long-overdue deregulation of the energy sector.
More broadly, Mr Kan should seize the national mood of solidarity with Tohoku to persuade people to accept difficult reforms. Higher taxes will be needed not just to pay for reconstruction in Tohoku but also to help shore up Japan's overstretched social-security system. The pension-eligible age, now nearly 65, may have to be raised sharply, too.
So far, Mr Kan's message has been muddy. He has backtracked on an idea to enter talks to create a free-trade area known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, even though the parts-suppliers in Tohoku that have been damaged in the disaster would benefit from freer trade. He has yet to spell out deregulatory proposals that would encourage private companies to invest, in Tohoku and elsewhere. 
His excuse is politics: with a divided Diet, it is tough to be bold. But that ignores his ability to harness public opinion for the cause. Not for years have good ideas flowed so freely in Japan. But such moods don't last. Miss this moment, Mr Kan, and Japan will rue it for years to come.","A rare reformist zeal is emerging in post - quake Japan .

ON MAY 13th Yoshihiro Murai, governor of the tsunami-stricken prefecture of Miyagi, received an angry petition from the bosses of a co-operative that has long controlled some of the richest fishing grounds off the coast of north-eastern Japan. Their slogan: ""We won't let fishermen be turned into salarymen."" They were responding to his proposal that, in return for money to rebuild their shattered livelihoods, they should let private firms fish in Miyagi's waters. Mr Murai, a former pilot, was undeterred by their protests, noting that with most of them over 60, the industry risked dying out anyway. Later he told The Economist that deregulation of Miyagi's coastline should serve as a model for reform nationwide. ""There's always pain when there's revolution,"" he said.
That resolve has become more common since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11th and the subsequent nuclear crisis jolted Japanese citizens' faith in their country and those who run it. The question now is whether the reformist zeal will stop at the rebuilding of Tohoku, the devastated region in the north-east, or go further, to solve the problems of overcapacity, high public debt and deflation that were plaguing Japan long before the disaster. 
The speed of the clear-up is raising hopes that the economy will prove resilient after the initial shock. Industrial production plunged by 15.5% between February and March, a far steeper drop than the previous monthly record of 8.6%, in February 2009 not long after Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. Figures this week showed that GDP fell at an annual rate of 3.7% in the first quarter compared with the last three months of 2010, pushing the economy technically back into recession. Moreover, the decline in output in late 2010 was 3% rather than the previous estimate of 1.3%. But private economists are forecasting a pick-up in the second half of the year, which would be a big improvement on what happened after Lehman (see chart).
Recovery in stricken Tohoku has been quicker than many had expected. Nine out of ten manufacturing firms damaged by the disaster hope to restore output to pre-crisis levels by mid-summer, the government says. After a heroic effort by Renesas Electronics, a quake-damaged chip company whose microcontrollers are vital for running many cars, hard-hit Toyota is now expecting to be back to normal production by the autumn (
). 
Electricity supply in Tokyo, thrown into chaos after the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant and other generators were knocked out by the quake and tsunami, is also being restored, which will further boost the revival. There have been no blackouts since March 29th. Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), the utility that owns the Fukushima plant, expects peak capacity to reach 55-56 gigawatts this summer, enough for a small surplus if it is not too hot.
Beyond Tokyo, doubts linger over possible losses of power during the summer because only 19 of the country's 54 nuclear reactors are in service. Many of those closed for routine maintenance require approval from local governors to be restarted, but with the Fukushima accident still so fresh in people's minds, it is touch and go whether they will get it. However, companies and households have shown a willingness to curb demand during peak hours, which the government hopes will ward off blackouts. 
Another bright spot is that consumers may be perking up. Although there was a record plunge in confidence in April, the ""Golden Week"" holiday in early May produced an unexpected flurry of tourism. ""It is the first time I have been happy in a traffic jam,"" quipped Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo.
But if the private sector is putting its back into reconstruction, the public sector is being less heroic. The government has passed a {Yen}4 trillion ($50 billion) supplementary budget for cleaning up the debris and other urgent tasks. But there is a political tug-of-war over a proposal to spend an extra {Yen}10 trillion on reconstructing and revitalising Tohoku, a lagging region even before the disaster. That public spending will be vital to ensure a strong rebound in the national economy. 
Even if Naoto Kan's government, which suffers from low poll ratings and divisions in parliament, can prevail on the extra budget, there are doubts about whether his leadership is strong enough to shake the economy out of two decades of low growth and rising debt. On May 17th the prime minister postponed a decision on whether to join talks to form a free-trade area called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was aimed at reducing the loss of manufacturing jobs to Asia, which is hollowing out Japan's industrial base and sapping tax revenues.
Another worry is whether Mr Kan can push through a reform of the fiscal system to help ease strains on the public finances. Polls show that the appetite for raising the consumption tax to help share the burden of reconstruction, which was strong shortly after the crisis, is now waning. 
Despite these doubts about the politics of reform, Mr Murai is not alone in calling for a decisive break with the past. Within the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), revised growth plans are being prepared that an official says would enable small power-producers to increase their contribution to the grid, encourage more renewable energy and introduce smart metering to stimulate conservation. Officials believe that a focus on green technologies could give new impetus to Japan's economy. Some think TEPCO should be put through bankruptcy while at the same time Tokyo's energy market should be opened to more competition. The government has not gone that far but on May 18th Mr Kan hinted that the monopolistic power of electrical utilities might be reviewed, which could lead to the separation of power generation and distribution.
There is, says one METI official, a change of mood. ""Before March 11th the goal of Japan was not that clear. Now it's much clearer."" At present most efforts are being focused on recovering from the disaster. But there is reason to hope that energy may be directed to finding a new way forward for an economy that grows mainly because of foreign trade, generates insufficient demand at home and has been unable to find a productive use for the oodles of spare cash that sits on private balance-sheets.","The Japanese economy is recovering faster than expected from disaster . Can broader reform come quickly too ? 
 ON MAY 13th Yoshihiro Murai , governor of the tsunami - stricken prefecture of Miyagi , received an angry petition from the bosses of a co - operative that has long controlled some of the richest fishing grounds off the coast of north - eastern Japan . Their slogan : "" We wo n't let fishermen be turned into salarymen . "" They were responding to his proposal that , in return for money to rebuild their shattered livelihoods , they should let private firms fish in Miyagi 's waters . Mr Murai , a former pilot , was undeterred by their protests , noting that with most of them over 60 , the industry risked dying out anyway . Later he told The Economist that deregulation of Miyagi 's coastline should serve as a model for reform nationwide . "" There 's always pain when there 's revolution , "" he said . 
 That resolve has become more common since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11th and the subsequent nuclear crisis jolted Japanese citizens ' faith in their country and those who run it . The question now is whether the reformist zeal will stop at the rebuilding of Tohoku , the devastated region in the north - east , or go further , to solve the problems of overcapacity , high public debt and deflation that were plaguing Japan long before the disaster . 
 The speed of the clear - up is raising hopes that the economy will prove resilient after the initial shock . Industrial production plunged by 15.5 % between February and March , a far steeper drop than the previous monthly record of 8.6 % , in February 2009 not long after Lehman Brothers ' bankruptcy . Figures this week showed that GDP fell at an annual rate of 3.7 % in the first quarter compared with the last three months of 2010 , pushing the economy technically back into recession . Moreover , the decline in output in late 2010 was 3 % rather than the previous estimate of 1.3 % . But private economists are forecasting a pick - up in the second half of the year , which would be a big improvement on what happened after Lehman ( see chart ) . 
 Recovery in stricken Tohoku has been quicker than many had expected . Nine out of ten manufacturing firms damaged by the disaster hope to restore output to pre - crisis levels by mid - summer , the government says . After a heroic effort by Renesas Electronics , a quake - damaged chip company whose microcontrollers are vital for running many cars , hard - hit Toyota is now expecting to be back to normal production by the autumn ( 
 ) . 
 Electricity supply in Tokyo , thrown into chaos after the Fukushima Dai - ichi nuclear plant and other generators were knocked out by the quake and tsunami , is also being restored , which will further boost the revival . There have been no blackouts since March 29th . Tokyo Electric Power ( TEPCO ) , the utility that owns the Fukushima plant , expects peak capacity to reach 55 - 56 gigawatts this summer , enough for a small surplus if it is not too hot . 
 Beyond Tokyo , doubts linger over possible losses of power during the summer because only 19 of the country 's 54 nuclear reactors are in service . Many of those closed for routine maintenance require approval from local governors to be restarted , but with the Fukushima accident still so fresh in people 's minds , it is touch and go whether they will get it . However , companies and households have shown a willingness to curb demand during peak hours , which the government hopes will ward off blackouts .

WHEN Naoto Kan moved into the prime minister's office a year ago, his wife, Nobuko, joked that she had packed only their summer clothes, fearing he would not survive for long.

Plotters are seeking to replace his government with a ""grand coalition"".
That might be a good idea for Japan's old elite, which has been dispossessed by Mr Kan's party. The old factions relish the idea of another taste of power. But for Japan, letting those people into office would be an awful step backwards.
All sides are to blame for Japan's political mess, Mr Kan included. His leadership during the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident has been shaky, and neither he nor his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) now has much support. 
Despite Mr Kan's obvious failings, nobody relishes a power vacuum. This is not a good time for a change of government. But Mr Kan is bound to leave office, for he has promised to quit. He bungled a confidence vote in parliament, and a huge package of emergency aid will pass only if he resigns. So now the question is not whether he will go, but what will replace him.
The establishment, including many of Japan's big businesses and Yomiuri Shimbun, the country's biggest-selling newspaper, is urging the parties to revive the old idea of a grand coalition. They say that parliamentary gridlock has delayed bills for rebuilding the disaster areas and jeopardised budget financing, and that a grand coalition is the only way the ruling DPJ can overcome the blocking vote wielded by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Japan might even realise overdue projects such as raising the consumption tax. Trust the people
Experience suggests this is nonsense. Since it won a majority in the upper house last year, the LDP-led block has done nothing but obstruct reform, even when Mr Kan shared its ideas for strengthening the public finances. It sacrificed national interest to tactical advantage. There is no reason to think Japan's political class will suddenly forsake the habit of a lifetime. More likely, the DPJ and the LDP would simply fall into each other's arms like two old drunks.
The notion that Mr Kan's enemies in the LDP have much to offer Japan is an insult to the public's intelligence. The LDP was kicked out of office in 2009 by voters sick of a 55-year-old system in which the party colluded with bureaucrats and business to preserve power. This system produced an under-regulated, over-confident nuclear industry whose legacy is the as-yet-unresolved Fukushima disaster. The LDP should be in the stocks, being pelted with Fukushima's radioactive vegetables, not relishing a return to government.
Rather than enter a grand coalition, the DPJ should go to the country. The disaster, for all the trauma it has caused, has created a chance for Japan to reform. It has revealed hidden depths of community spirit, local leadership, industrial strength and creativity in hitherto overlooked regions of Japan (see
). The nuclear crisis has revealed the need to curb the malign influence of powerful utilities such as Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO). Decentralisation and utility reform would probably be anathema to a grand coalition, whose champions are natural power-grabbers and have spent their political careers beholden to outfits like TEPCO. But both are essential to Japan.
In some ways, this is a dreadful time to hold an election. Nobody in an evacuation shelter would relish the distraction; indeed some towns probably lost their voting records in the tsunami. Yet an election need not be a huge burden, and it could have advantages. It would give the victims of the tsunami and the nuclear disaster a chance to make their voices heard. The public could debate energy policy and decentralisation. Voters could even decide whether to raise consumption taxes.
The crisis has shone a harsh light on Japan's politicians. Letting people express their frustration with the system might just be a step on the way to changing it.","Naoto Kan's opponents want a grand coalition . That 's a terrible idea

THE earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident that struck Japan three months ago have revealed something important about the country: a seam of strength and composure in the bedrock of society that has surprised even the Japanese themselves. Not only has this resilience helped the hundreds of thousands suffering from the loss of families, homes and livelihoods to cope with their suffering, despite the self-absorbed dithering of their national politicians in Tokyo. By reminding Japan of the hidden depths of its local communities, especially compared with the shallowness of central government, it has also provided a sense of how Japan could emerge stronger from the crisis, ending years of economic drift.
One of the most heroic examples of community spirit was 24-year-old Miki Endo, who used the loudspeaker system in Minamisanriku, a fishing port close to the focus of the 9.0 earthquake, to urge residents to do what they could to escape the incoming tsunami. She drowned at her post. Television footage shows the rising sea approaching, with her haunting voice echoing over the waves. More than 1,000 of the town's 18,000 residents died. 
Quieter examples of selflessness also abound. One fisherman tells of the four days he spent clearing the wreckage of his village, with no knowledge of the whereabouts of his eldest son. When his son eventually appeared, walking down off the mountain after a long cross-country trek to reach his parents, the two wiped tears from their eyes but did not say a word to each other. The son did not wish to disturb his father's toil.
The quality and commitment of local leaders have been a revelation, so refreshing compared with the bickering politicians in the national Diet (parliament). Talk to mayors in the disaster-stricken areas and you get a sense of Wild Western true grit. Jin Sato, mayor of Minamisanriku, is one. He survived the tsunami by clinging to a fence on the top of a building as water washed over his head for three minutes. Since then he has worked all hours, sleeping in a cot in his office.
Another is Katsunobu Sakurai, mayor of Minamisoma, near the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant. In the heat of the crisis, he posted an SOS video on YouTube, begging for help for residents of his town, who were stranded because of high radiation levels. On June 9th in Tokyo he publicly berated the government for lacking first-hand knowledge of his area's plight even three months after the disaster. He urged it to show more leadership. 
The more forcibly such mayors speak out, the clearer it becomes that their communities are not just disaster-stricken; they are also on the front-line of all of Japan's most pressing problems, be they economic decline, ageing, debt, or depopulation. National leaders in Tokyo avoid tackling Japan's huge fiscal problems, but municipal authorities have first-hand experience of the effects of shrinking budgets. Though some of these authorities have recklessly inflated those problems through mismanagement, many others have become masters in the art of thrift. 
In the past decade local governments have merged towns, reduced the number of schools and run welfare services on a shoestring. In the process the average size of municipalities in Japan has almost doubled from 36,000 people to 69,000.
Yet the small amount of revenue they raise compared with what they spend (local taxes provide about 40% of their income) means that they remain reliant on the central government which, deep in debt itself, has to spend about 60% of its money on local government. On top of this precarious situation, authorities in the disaster areas now face the vast challenge of rebuilding after a tragedy that left 24,000 people dead or unaccounted for, and 100,000 at least temporarily homeless. Even in the face of this horror, the sense of local pulling-together persists. 
There are plenty who dwell on the downsides of this community spirit. Some executives (especially foreign ones) dismiss its effect on business as thinly disguised socialism; it puts the preservation of jobs above profit, and prevents companies going bust that would otherwise make room for new competitors. It can stifle innovation, because it discourages people from speaking out. And it sometimes edges towards xenophobia--though the only sign of this has been a few mutterings about ""foreign looters"" in disaster areas. 
Above all, it remains deeply hierarchical; even in small groups people refrain from challenging their elders and superiors. Occasionally that deference is deserved: the elderly may play a valuable role in their communities. One statistic shows that 65% of those who drowned were over 60; anecdotally, it appears that a lot died with infant grandchildren in their arms. They were looking after them while the generation in between worked. That has shocked Tokyoites, who thought the extended family was long gone. Hard-headed northerners
Over the past three months this strength in adversity in one of the country's most under-reported regions has made people rethink their old conceptions about Japan's geography. Tohoku, the region of northern Honshu where the disaster struck, is an unusual place and part of its resilience may be culturally specific. Its tight-knit, independent streak dates back centuries. More than 1,100 years ago, the last time a tsunami of such scale lashed its shores, its tribesmen were known by southerners as Emishi (insubordinate northerners). At that time, they had only recently been vanquished by the Yamato, which remains the dominant ethnic group. 
But if Tohoku could prove so strong, perhaps other parts of the hinterland are equally so. The crisis revealed Japan's blind spot about what goes on beyond the centre of power. For instance, Eisuke Sakakibara, a former finance mandarin once known as ""Mr Yen"" for his influence on currency markets, expressed astonishment at the number of parts suppliers in the disaster zone which could disrupt global supply chains. Some of those little-known firms, such as Renesas Electronics, whose tiny microcontrollers are vital for the car industry, are recovering fast--which will help the wheels of the global economy spin a bit more quickly. Yet among the Tokyo-centric elite, few knew how important these scattered firms were. 
Because of such pockets of dynamism, the economic potential of Japan's regions, from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south, is much larger than is often assumed. Areas that are viewed as ageing backwaters on fiscal life-support could justifiably claim to be economic entities in their own right--if they had more freedom to set their own policies and balance their books. Tohoku, for example, has a GDP the size of Argentina's; Kyushu's economy is the same as Norway's (see map).
Yet until now they have remained peripheral to Tokyo, the engine room of the economy, and their fragile finances reflect that. A series of decentralising reforms since 1995 have failed to provide fiscal autonomy, nor has local government attracted a depth of talent to match its new responsibilities. There was a step forward last month when municipalities were given the chance to talk directly to the central government, without going through the usual prefectural channels. But the clamour is for more independence. Osaka and Nagoya, Japan's second and third industrial hubs, are especially tired of playing second-fiddle to greater Tokyo; local leaders in both cities are trying to create bigger economic enclaves and new political parties. 
The gap between capital and countryside--especially as seen from Tohoku--has grown starker in recent weeks, thanks to the antics within the government and the Diet. From the early days of the crisis it was not lost on many evacuees that few politicians had bothered to make the two-to-four hour journey by train from Tokyo to witness their plight first-hand. (By contrast, the 77-year-old Emperor Akihito and his wife Michiko have made frequent visits, bowing deeply before the victims.)
In Fukushima people have been infuriated by the apparently arbitrary way the government has set limits on the levels of radiation, which affect whether people are allowed to stay in their villages or not. Across the country there is dissatisfaction at the apparently arbitrary way the government has declared some foods safe from radiation, and others unsafe. And in the tsunami zone mayors say they badly need guidance, not just on how to rebuild their shattered towns, but also on how much money they will have to spend. 
To many there was no starker demonstration of the out-of-touch arrogance of national politicians than on June 2nd when opponents of Naoto Kan, the prime minister, sought and failed to force him out of office, by way of a no-confidence motion in the lower house. In the disaster area mayors spoke out angrily at the way political gamesmanship was distracting from recovery efforts. ""When someone is drowning, what's important is not who rescues them, but how they are rescued,"" complained Hideo Abe, mayor of Higashimatsushima, a damaged port.
Matters worsened when Mr Kan won a reprieve by promising to stand down, and then appeared hours later to backtrack on the timing. Three months after March 11th, his government has still not submitted a {Yen}10 trillion ($125 billion) emergency reconstruction budget, nor secured approval for funding mechanisms to pay for the annual budget. The opposition, which controls the upper house, is demanding that he goes as a condition for passing the finance requests, possibly as a prelude to forming a ""grand coalition"" with the ruling party. Leaders who don't lead
Amid such chaotic politics, some despair of their national leaders. ""The brain is dead, but at least the rest of the body is functioning,"" quips Yoichi Takamoto, a Kyushu-based entrepreneur and head of TMSUK, a robot manufacturer. But that does not necessarily mean that he or others despair for the country. 
Seiichiro Yonekura, professor of innovation at Hitotsubashi University, notes that Japan has rarely had outstanding leaders during its modern history. Even in the post-war era only a few politicians had any charisma. Yet the country rebuilt Tokyo from the ashes of the second world war, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki from atomic destruction. Japan became the world's second largest economy. If something of a similar magnitude is to be achieved again, good ideas are crucial. Then, like ""ants in an anthill"", he predicts, Japanese society will get to work. 
This sounds idealistic, but it would not be the first time a natural disaster has done more than shake the ground under Japan's feet. An earthquake that levelled Tokyo (then called Edo) in 1855 loosely coincided with the beginning of the end of more than two centuries of feudal isolation; the Meiji imperial family was restored to power in 1868. Another in 1891 forced Japan to re-examine its Meiji-era love of all things Western; many of the European-style brick buildings it had used to replace its traditional wooden ones fell down. In 1923 the Great Kanto Earthquake helped set in motion a political crisis that ultimately led to militarism and the second world war. Planning and money
Since the March disaster two overarching challenges have emerged that could, if tackled, have similarly far-reaching consequences (though without, one hopes, the belligerence). First, Japan has to come up with plans and finance for rebuilding the tsunami-wrecked towns so that they will not only suit the mostly elderly people who used to live there but will also be revitalised to attract the young. 
Second, it needs to use the Fukushima disaster to rethink energy policy and decentralise decision-making in a way that could kick-start economic revival. Both issues profoundly challenge the tenets by which Japan has been ruled in recent decades. But if ever there were a moment for the country to break out of its centralised straitjacket, this is it.
Jun Iio, who heads the working group of the prime minister's Reconstruction Design Council, says that some big bureaucratic hurdles have already been overcome which, he reckons, shows an unprecedented level of flexibility in the relevant ministries. One is planning. For the first time the Land Ministry and the Agricultural Ministry have agreed, as a result of the tsunami, to relax the rigid restrictions on the use of farm and urban land. 
Mr Iio says this means that parts of the cities that were swept away by the floods can be reclassified as farmland. The plan is that the people who used to live there will be relocated by the government to apartments on higher ground. It is not yet clear how much they will be paid for their old houses. To help things along, the powerful Justice Ministry has agreed to be flexible on property rights. 
But mayors such as Isoo Sasaki of Natori, a town whose port was washed away by the tsunami (he also lost his 140-year-old sake business), insist they should be able to tailor their rebuilding efforts to individual communities' needs, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all policy. He admits that during Japan's bubble era in the 1980s, there were embarrassing local building initiatives that saddled towns with both debts and eyesores. But he believes municipalities have learned from their mistakes; indeed, a few pioneering planners have made great strides recently reviving their towns with old feudal-era ideas that encourage compact and sustainable living arrangements.
Then there is the question of money: the affected areas cannot possibly afford to rebuild themselves. And people are fearful that when the money is finally approved in parliament, it will come with strings tightly attached.
Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi, the most prosperous prefecture hit by the crisis, points out that this is a perennial problem. He says he has raised taxes twice, cut his staff and shed popular services to save money, yet the discretionary spending power of his office is still only 5-6% of the total budget. He believes one way to raise money would be to increase consumption tax, which people have said they would be prepared to tolerate in order to pay for the emergency. But the government, as yet, is only studying the issue. Perhaps one difference is that Mr Murai, who used to be a helicopter pilot in Miyagi and knows every inch of its coastline, appreciates much better than his central-government counterparts how badly the money is needed. Nuclear or not
Responding to the nuclear disaster is even harder. Mr Kan had initially sought to stay in power until the Fukushima nuclear plant has stabilised its reactors and reached a state of ""cold shutdown"". But the timetable for that may already have slipped into 2012, which is too distant for those trying to oust him.
Not only is Fukushima Dai-ichi's owner, Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), struggling to keep the plant under control. It is also stretched by the demands for compensation from people whose livelihoods, at least for the time being, have been ruined by the disaster. The government has patched together a compensation scheme, but experts believe this may have been a sop to let the company's book-keepers approve the end-of-year accounts. As fears of bankruptcy mount, TEPCO's shares hit a new low on June 6th. 
Tatsuo Hatta, an economist at Gakushuin University in Tokyo, believes TEPCO may have to sell off its power plants to international operators to remain solvent. That could set in motion what he and a few outspoken commentators consider a long overdue overhaul of the energy market in Japan, which could have an immense impact on national politics. He says that executives at TEPCO and the other oligopolistic electricity utilities have stifled argument about Japan's nuclear-energy programme, both by pouring money into politics and by muffling the media through their huge advertising budgets.
Yet those anxious for change note approvingly that even on energy policy, power has now shifted slightly towards local and regional governments. Prefectural governors, including those who originally supported nuclear power, are having second thoughts. In some areas local authorities are expressing strong opposition to the restarting of nuclear reactors closed for maintenance; consequently, all but 19 of the nation's 54 reactors are out of action.
Others, however, are weighing up costs and benefits, as they should. On June 5th a governor was re-elected in Aomori prefecture, on the northern tip of Honshu, who said he would keep its two nuclear-power plants provided an experts' committee was set up that vouched for their safety. The prefecture is one of Japan's poorest, which may be why it is prepared to strike a deal with the nuclear industry. 
In a decentralised system different areas could take a different view of what forms of energy are best for them. Hokkaido, for example, could benefit from its proximity to Russia's natural gas deposits off the eastern coast of Siberia. Okinawa in the south could benefit from solar power, because it has lots of sunshine. Wind could power the country's mountainous areas. Places like Tokyo, with their vast needs, could use a variety of sources.
As for Tohoku, some believe that it should set the tone for a national energy policy that is increasingly self-reliant and efficient. Thus, its towns could be rebuilt to minimise electricity use and car traffic. The huge swathes of land destroyed by the tsunami or depopulated because of radiation could become wind, wave or solar farms. As for Fukushima itself, some wits say it could become a new home for the central government. Then again, perhaps it has already suffered enough.
Caption: A future with wind; A future with wind","The aftermath of the March 11th disasters shows that Japan 's strengths lie outside Tokyo , in its regions 
 THE earthquake , tsunami and nuclear accident that struck Japan three months ago have revealed something important about the country : a seam of strength and composure in the bedrock of society that has surprised even the Japanese themselves . Not only has this resilience helped the hundreds of thousands suffering from the loss of families , homes and livelihoods to cope with their suffering , despite the self - absorbed dithering of their national politicians in Tokyo . By reminding Japan of the hidden depths of its local communities , especially compared with the shallowness of central government , it has also provided a sense of how Japan could emerge stronger from the crisis , ending years of economic drift . 
 One of the most heroic examples of community spirit was 24 - year - old Miki Endo , who used the loudspeaker system in Minamisanriku , a fishing port close to the focus of the 9.0 earthquake , to urge residents to do what they could to escape the incoming tsunami . She drowned at her post . Television footage shows the rising sea approaching , with her haunting voice echoing over the waves . More than 1,000 of the town 's 18,000 residents died . 
 Quieter examples of selflessness also abound . One fisherman tells of the four days he spent clearing the wreckage of his village , with no knowledge of the whereabouts of his eldest son . When his son eventually appeared , walking down off the mountain after a long cross - country trek to reach his parents , the two wiped tears from their eyes but did not say a word to each other . The son did not wish to disturb his father 's toil . 
 The quality and commitment of local leaders have been a revelation , so refreshing compared with the bickering politicians in the national Diet ( parliament ) . Talk to mayors in the disaster - stricken areas and you get a sense of Wild Western true grit . Jin Sato , mayor of Minamisanriku , is one . He survived the tsunami by clinging to a fence on the top of a building as water washed over his head for three minutes . Since then he has worked all hours , sleeping in a cot in his office . 
 Another is Katsunobu Sakurai , mayor of Minamisoma , near the Fukushima Dai - ichi nuclear - power plant . In the heat of the crisis , he posted an SOS video on YouTube , begging for help for residents of his town , who were stranded because of high radiation levels . On June 9th in Tokyo he publicly berated the government for lacking first - hand knowledge of his area 's plight even three months after the disaster . He urged it to show more leadership . 
 The more forcibly such mayors speak out , the clearer it becomes that their communities are not just disaster - stricken ; they are also on the front - line of all of Japan 's most pressing problems , be they economic decline , ageing , debt , or depopulation . National leaders in Tokyo avoid tackling Japan 's huge fiscal problems , but municipal authorities have first - hand experience of the effects of shrinking budgets . Though some of these authorities have recklessly inflated those problems through mismanagement , many others have become masters in the art of thrift . 
 In the past decade local governments have merged towns , reduced the number of schools and run welfare services on a shoestring . In the process the average size of municipalities in Japan has almost doubled from 36,000 people to 69,000 . 
 Yet the small amount of revenue they raise compared with what they spend ( local taxes provide about 40 % of their income ) means that they remain reliant on the central government which , deep in debt itself , has to spend about 60 % of its money on local government . On top of this precarious situation , authorities in the disaster areas now face the vast challenge of rebuilding after a tragedy that left 24,000 people dead or unaccounted for , and 100,000 at least temporarily homeless . Even in the face of this horror , the sense of local pulling - together persists . 
 There are plenty who dwell on the downsides of this community spirit . Some executives ( especially foreign ones ) dismiss its effect on business as thinly disguised socialism ; it puts the preservation of jobs above profit , and prevents companies going bust that would otherwise make room for new competitors . It can stifle innovation , because it discourages people from speaking out . And it sometimes edges towards xenophobia -- though the only sign of this has been a few mutterings about "" foreign looters "" in disaster areas . 
 Above all , it remains deeply hierarchical ; even in small groups people refrain from challenging their elders and superiors . Occasionally that deference is deserved : the elderly may play a valuable role in their communities . One statistic shows that 65 % of those who drowned were over 60 ; anecdotally , it appears that a lot died with infant grandchildren in their arms . They were looking after them while the generation in between worked . That has shocked Tokyoites , who thought the extended family was long gone . Hard - headed northerners

LIKE one of the irradiated dogs that have been left to fend for themselves in the shadow of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, Naoto Kan, the Japanese prime minister, is giving the impression that he has gone feral. Why else but because of a blind craving for power would he defy even his friends within the government who are begging him to resign?
Given that politics has been in a state of paralysis since the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident on March 11th, it is a fair question. Both outside the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and within it, many politicians are so exasperated with Mr Kan's lack of leadership that they cannot see any hope of laws essential for recovery and reconstruction being passed until he steps down.
Yet, either through luck or cunning, Mr Kan has managed to keep one step ahead of those baying for his blood. He survived a no-confidence motion in parliament a month ago by promising to step down eventually. On June 27th Mr Kan at last set the conditions that he said would enable him to resign.
The conditions were the passage of three bills: a {Yen}2 trillion ($25 billion) supplementary budget to cope with the disaster; the issuance of bonds to finance the 2011-12 budget deficit; and an electricity initiative to broaden the scope of feed-in tariffs to encourage more use of renewable energy in the national grid. All three have been held up by opposition from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which pretty much ran Japan for 55 years until 2009 and is fixated with destroying Mr Kan. It has demanded that he quits before, not after, it approves any bills--though Mr Kan would not be the only one to doubt its sincerity.
Mr Kan's conditions put the ball back in the LDP's court, but not for long. Confusingly, on the same day that he set the conditions for his retirement, the prime minister reshuffled his cabinet. He appointed a renegade LDP politician, Kazuyuki Hamada, to handle internal affairs in parliament. With that move, Mr Kan managed to incense both the LDP and his own party.
Given such confusion, some observers do not discount the possibility that Mr Kan might make one final lunge for redemption. They say that later this summer he might dissolve parliament and call a snap election, aiming to campaign on a pledge to abandon nuclear power. He might even quit, it is whispered, on the anniversary of the bombing on Hiroshima on August 6th, when anti-nuclear feelings run high. On June 28th Mr Kan did nothing to dispel the rumours, telling DPJ politicians that energy policy was likely to be the most important issue in the next election.
There would be political resonances to such a gamble. In early August 2005 the then-prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, called a snap election to push through postal privatisation. It was a move that nearly split the ruling LDP but also gave Mr Koizumi a landslide victory. In post-Fukushima Japan, nuclear power would be a much more emotive issue. ""It could be a bomb to destroy both the DPJ and the LDP,"" says Takeshi Sasaki of Gakushuin University in Tokyo. He speculates that, like Mr Koizumi, Mr Kan might attempt to surround himself with charismatic young politicians to be the face of the next government. Such people might include Goshi Hosono, Mr Kan's 39-year-old Mr Fix-it who this week was appointed minister in charge of the nuclear mess.
There are just as many reasons to doubt that such an election would be feasible, however. The high command of Mr Kan's party would be staunchly opposed, fearing the DPJ would lose. Nor is it yet clear how firmly the public has swung against nuclear power since March 11th. After all, years of power shortages loom. What is more, no one in the disaster areas is in any mood for a national election. All they ask is for parliament to provide funds and lead the reconstruction.
Mr Kan's biggest drawback is that, unlike Mr Koizumi at the time, he is not popular. However much the public dislikes the mainstream parties, they do not like him either. A poll published on June 29th by Kyodo, a news wire, showed over two-thirds of those surveyed wanted him to step down immediately or by the end of August. The election scenario ""won't happen. It would be a suicide mission. He's no Koizumi,"" says Gerald Curtis of Columbia University. He certainly isn't. But regardless of whether Mr Kan calls an election or not, if the main parties cannot find common ground for dealing with the disaster, they still need a bomb put under them.","Naoto Kan defies both friends and enemies

 Yet , either through luck or cunning , Naoto Kan has managed to keep one step ahead of those baying for Naoto Kan's blood . Naoto Kan survived a no - confidence motion in parliament a month ago by promising to step down eventually . On June 27th Naoto Kan at last set the conditions that Naoto Kan said would enable Naoto Kan to resign . 
 The conditions were the passage of three bills : a { Yen}2 trillion ( $ 25 billion ) supplementary budget to cope with the disaster ; the issuance of bonds to finance the 2011 - 12 budget deficit ; and an electricity initiative to broaden the scope of feed - in tariffs to encourage more use of renewable energy in the national grid . All three have been held up by opposition from the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which pretty much ran Japan for 55 years until 2009 and is fixated with destroying Naoto Kan It has demanded that Naoto Kan quits before , not after , it approves any bills -- though Naoto Kan would not be the only one to doubt its sincerity . 
 Naoto Kan's conditions put the ball back in the LDP 's court , but not for long . Confusingly , on the same day that Naoto Kan set the conditions for Naoto Kan's retirement , Naoto Kan reshuffled Naoto Kan's cabinet . Naoto Kan appointed a renegade LDP politician , Kazuyuki Hamada , to handle internal affairs in parliament . With that move , Naoto Kan managed to incense both the LDP and Naoto Kan's own party . 
 Given such confusion , some observers do not discount the possibility that Naoto Kan might make one final lunge for redemption . They say that later this summer Naoto Kan might dissolve parliament and call a snap election , aiming to campaign on a pledge to abandon nuclear power . Naoto Kan might even quit , it is whispered , on the anniversary of the bombing on Hiroshima on August 6th , when anti - nuclear feelings run high . On June 28th Naoto Kan did nothing to dispel the rumours , telling DPJ politicians that energy policy was likely to be the most important issue in the next election . 
 There would be political resonances to such a gamble . In early August 2005 the then - prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi , called a snap election to push through postal privatisation . It was a move that nearly split the ruling LDP but also gave Mr Koizumi a landslide victory . In post - Fukushima Japan , nuclear power would be a much more emotive issue . "" It could be a bomb to destroy both the DPJ and the LDP , "" says Takeshi Sasaki of Gakushuin University in Tokyo . He speculates that , like Mr Koizumi , Naoto Kan might attempt to surround Naoto Kan with charismatic young politicians to be the face of the next government . Such people might include Goshi Hosono , Naoto Kan's 39 - year - old Mr Fix - it who this week was appointed minister in charge of the nuclear mess . 
 There are just as many reasons to doubt that such an election would be feasible , however . The high command of Mr Kan 's party would be staunchly opposed , fearing the DPJ would lose . Nor is it yet clear how firmly the public has swung against nuclear power since March 11th . After all , years of power shortages loom . What is more , no one in the disaster areas is in any mood for a national election . All they ask is for parliament to provide funds and lead the reconstruction . 
 Naoto Kan's biggest drawback is that , unlike Mr Koizumi at the time , Naoto Kan is not popular . However much the public dislikes the mainstream parties , they do not like Naoto Kan either . A poll published on June 29th by Kyodo , a news wire , showed over two - thirds of those surveyed wanted Naoto Kan to step down immediately or by the end of August . The election scenario "" wo n't happen . It would be a suicide mission . Naoto Kan 's no Koizumi , "" says Gerald Curtis of Columbia University . Naoto Kan certainly is n't . But regardless of whether Naoto Kan calls an election or not , if the main parties can not find common ground for dealing with the disaster , they still need a bomb put under them .",740,Japan,A30-187,IN TERM,True,The unfathomable Naoto Kan,39,True

""THROW yourself into a nuclear reactor and die!"" one investor shouted. Japanese shareholders are usually more polite, but this was the annual meeting of TEPCO, the Japanese power company that owns the Fukushima nuclear plant. Since an earthquake in March caused a meltdown, TEPCO faces unlimited demands for compensation. Its shares have fallen by nearly 90% (see chart). A man at the meeting on June 28th suggested that the board take responsibility by committing seppuku, or ritual suicide.
Not everything went wrong for TEPCO. A shareholder motion to close all its nuclear plants was defeated. But apart from that, things look grim. TEPCO faces claims for compensation that, in a worst-case scenario, could exceed its assets of {Yen}15 trillion ($186 billion). No one knows how much it will have to pay. (Oddly, it is the education ministry's job to issue guidelines for nuclear compensation.) Estimates of TEPCO's liabilities range between {Yen}4 trillion and {Yen}25 trillion. The firm also owes {Yen}7.8 trillion to bondholders and bank creditors. If TEPCO goes bust, these people take precedence over those affected by the disaster, a fact that is politically radioactive.
Four months ago, TEPCO was the cornerstone of corporate Japan. Some 750,000 people, many of them elderly, still own its shares. The company, which accounts for a hefty 8% of Japan's total domestic debt market, had its bond rating cut to junk by Moody's on June 20th, following a similar downgrade by Standard & Poor's in May. 
Only the government can save TEPCO from bankruptcy. A bill submitted on June 14th to the Diet, Japan's parliament, aims to enable the firm to pay compensation without going under. It would establish a mechanism for the government to channel truckloads of money to TEPCO, which the firm would then pass on to the victims. This would be repaid from TEPCO's earnings, with help from other nuclear operators. The new entity could purchase TEPCO assets. One insider thinks this will lead to partial nationalisation. Another reckons that the new entity might buy fresh bonds that TEPCO could issue to meet its obligations.
The bill has not been seriously debated in the Diet, in part because of political paralysis. But officials believe it will be ratified before the end of the summer because the consequences of shelving it are unthinkable. Compensation must be paid, the recovery work at Fukushima must go on and the lights in Tokyo must stay on. 
However, the bill is only a stop-gap. It may soothe TEPCO's creditors. It may even reassure the public that payouts won't lead to higher electricity bills. But critics grumble that the plan protects shareholders at the expense of taxpayers. 
The long-term solutions being considered include bankruptcy, temporary nationalisation for the purpose of selling off assets, or capping TEPCO's liability and making it, in addition to an energy provider, a vehicle for compensation payments. TEPCO favours a liability cap. Only this, the thinking goes, will lure back investors and let TEPCO become a normal company again. But this may scupper any chance of energy-sector liberalisation, since the company would need fistfuls of profits in order to make its payouts. ""When I meet with TEPCO officials, I don't see any change in mindset; it's as if nothing has changed,"" sighs a nuclear-energy official. 
Bankruptcy or temporary nationalisation would be bolder. Either could herald energy deregulation, since a regional monopoly would be broken up and sold. The government could then separate energy generation and transmission, which the prime minister, Naoto Kan, supports but few other politicians do. Outsiders, such as Softbank, a mobile-phone operator, are keen to enter the energy business. But big business, which ought to favour competition to lower energy prices, is against deregulation. This may be because so many big firms act as suppliers to the utilities, which pay high prices to reward loyalty. 
Across Japan, regional power companies are caught in Fukushima's fallout. Most prefectural governors are refusing to restart nuclear plants that shut for regular maintenance. Power shortages loom. Other shareholder meetings have been almost as stormy as TEPCO's. The biggest shareholder of KEPCO, the utility in the Kansai region, is the city of Osaka, which has a 9% stake. Its mayor turned up at the annual general meeting and urged the firm to diversify away from nuclear energy. Such demands are popular. Three-quarters of Japanese want to reduce or eliminate the country's reliance on nuclear power--many more than before the accident. 
The utilities now face more scrutiny and tighter energy supplies. They are also unlikely to win permission to raise rates. (As regional monopolies, their prices are set and their profit margins are guaranteed by regulators.) Their solid credit ratings could liquefy. KEPCO and another utility recently cancelled new corporate-bond offerings because yields soared. 
Firms that had cross-shareholdings in the utilities have also taken a hit. Even banks are affected: cabinet members have suggested they share the pain by forgiving a portion of TEPCO's pre-quake loans. Naturally, this whacked their share prices.
The Fukushima disaster presents an opportunity for radical reform. But in a crisis people often grow conservative. Since the government holds the purse-strings, it can more or less dictate terms to TEPCO. The fear is that it will bankroll a return to business as usual.","The fallout from the Fukushima nuclear disaster is spreading throughout Japan's energy industry

TWO weeks after Japan's trade minister gave the all-clear to restart nuclear-power plants that had been shut for maintenance, Naoto Kan, the prime minister, ordered on July 6th that they should first undergo rigorous stress tests. The inverted sequence showed that only a cursory examination had taken place. Hideo Kishimoto, a mayor in southwestern Japan who had earlier given his local power company permission to restart the Genkai nuclear-power plant, retracted his approval. ""I can't trust the government,"" he said. 
It is a refrain heard throughout Japan, aimed not only at national politicians but also at the power companies, bureaucrats, academics and the media who had given assurances that the country's nuclear plants were disaster-proof. A country that has long been governed by informal bonds of trust is seeing them start to fray. The meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant is forcing a re-examination of Japan's most influential institutions. 
The credibility gap bedevils the utilities. Tokyo Electric (TEPCO), the utility that serves the capital and runs the Fukushima plant, has been accused of withholding data from the start, including from the prime minister. And the energy firms have a record of spotty safety standards and cover-ups stretching back years. Yet their image worsened in recent days when it transpired that Kyushu Electric, which operates Genkai, asked thousands of employees to pose as ordinary citizens and send e-mails and faxes in support of reopening reactors at a public meeting in June that was televised live. The attempt to manipulate public sentiment, exposed by a rare whistle-blower, angered the public and energised the media. 
Japan's food supply is safe. But pockets of doubt have crept in, owing to a mishandling of safety inspections. On July 13th the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said that beef contaminated with radioactive caesium more than six times above the safety limit was sold and possibly consumed. It followed initial reports that the meat never made it to market. Though the quantity was small (only a few cows, it appears so far) and the health risk said to be non-existent, it raises suspicions. When radiation above European safety limits was found in tea from Shizuoka in June, a prefectural official asked the retailer, Radishbo-ya, to keep quiet so as not to harm local growers. 
The crisis of confidence in Japanese authority is still at the seedling stage. Yet lately there have been nightly televised exposes of the gulf between official reassurances and the worrying reality. Even the belated stress tests raise eyebrows: they will be undertaken by the utilities themselves and checked by two regulatory agencies that previously failed to supervise the utilities properly. On July 13th Mr Kan said he wants Japan to reduce nuclear power on safety grounds, if not to get rid of it altogether. A few months ago such a policy was unthinkable, because of the risk of power shortages. The public increasingly supports it--but not Mr Kan.","Japan 's nuclear crisis is eroding deference to authority

WHAT do bond investors do when debt crises threaten the euro zone and America? Head for safety in a far more indebted country. Yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) fell to an eight-month low on July 19th; the yen strengthened against the euro and the dollar.
That looks very odd. Compared with Italy, the latest target of creditor angst, on many counts Japan is more troubling. Its net debt is bigger as a share of GDP and it has a primary budget deficit (ie, before interest payments), whereas Italy has a surplus. With the fastest-ageing society on Earth its growth prospects are not obviously better than Italy's, and its government is just as dysfunctional, if not as lurid. Even its free-floating currency is a mixed blessing: the yen has continued to strengthen after the March 11th earthquake and tsunami deepened Japan's recession.
The economy is now showing signs of recovery. But recent policy setbacks have thrown further doubt on the country's long-term creditworthiness. On July 19th the IMF gave a tepid welcome to a government plan, unveiled last month, to double the consumption tax to 10% by the mid-2010s, and called for something more ambitious. Ratings agencies did not hide their disappointment with the plan, which was watered down at the last minute.
Energy is another concern. In response to the meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear-power plant, much of the country's nuclear capacity has been suspended. Naoto Kan, the prime minister, has talked of abandoning atomic energy altogether. It is hard to fathom what the government really intends to do but economists reckon a phase-out of all nuclear power would make projected economic growth even weaker and hit the trade balance, which has already slid into deficit (see chart).
The current account is still likely to remain in surplus because income from Japan's trove of foreign assets provides a bigger contribution than trade. But an energy crisis could encourage firms to reinvest their overseas profits rather than repatriating them, which could eventually eliminate the surplus. Once that happens, Japan would need to rely on foreign creditors. 
Besides the current-account surplus, the main pillars of support for Japan's debt load are its cash-rich households and firms. Households alone have assets of {Yen}1,470 trillion yen ($16 trillion), or roughly twice the amount of outstanding government bonds. The corporate sector saves about 8% of GDP, which largely offsets a fiscal deficit that is expected to reach a whopping 10.5% of GDP this year. Much of this money is parked in Japanese financial institutions, which hold about three-quarters of government bonds. Foreigners, mainly central banks, account for just 5%.
With a strengthening currency and domestic deflation, holding JGBs has been a good bet even with ten-year yields down at nearly 1%. But the risks of a confidence crisis, though not necessarily imminent, cannot be ruled out. Banks, for example, hold JGBs because they cannot find better returns elsewhere. ""It's not a matter of loyalty. They are trying to maintain their profits,"" says Tab Bowers of McKinsey, a consultancy. When the risks of holding too much debt outweigh the rewards, they would jump ship as fast as anyone.","The long-term prognosis for the debt-ridden economy is not good

A GOVERNMENT'S credibility is founded on its commitment to honour its debts. As a result of the dramas of the past few weeks, that crucial commodity is eroding in the West. The struggles in Europe to keep Greece in the euro zone and the brinkmanship in America over the debt ceiling have presented investors with an unattractive choice: should you buy the currency that may default, or the one that could disintegrate? 
In the early days of the economic crisis the West's leaders did a reasonable job of clearing up a mess that was only partly of their making. Now the politicians have become the problem. In both America and Europe, they are exhibiting the sort of behaviour that could turn a downturn into stagnation. The West's leaders are not willing to make tough choices; and everybody--the markets, the leaders of the emerging world, the banks, even the voters--knows it. It is a mark of how low expectations have sunk that the euro zone's half-rescue of Greece on July 21st was greeted with relief. As The Economist went to press, it still was not clear on what terms America's debt limit would be raised, and for how long. Even if the current crises abate or are averted, the real danger persists: that the West's political system cannot take the difficult decisions needed to recover from a crisis and prosper in the years ahead.
The world has seen this before. Two decades ago, Japan's economic bubble popped; since then its leaders have procrastinated and postured. The years of political paralysis have done Japan more harm than the economic excesses of the 1980s. Its economy has barely grown and its regional influence has withered. As a proportion of GDP, its gross public debt is the highest in the world, twice America's and nearly twice Italy's. If something similar were to happen to its fellow democracies in Europe and America, the consequences would be far larger. No wonder China's autocrats, flush with cash and an (only partly deserved) reputation for getting things done, feel as if the future is on their side. Yes, you Kan, if you carry on like this
Though both about debt, the arguments in Europe and America have very different origins. The euro crisis was brought on by investors with genuine worries about the solvency of several euro-zone countries. By contrast the stand-off in Washington is a political creation, thrust upon initially incredulous investors (see page
). Increasing America's overdraft beyond $14.3 trillion should have been relatively simple. But Republican congressmen, furious about big government, have recklessly used it as a political tool to embarrass Barack Obama.
The similarity between the European and American dramas lies in the protagonists' refusal to face reality. European politicians, led by Angela Merkel, have gone to absurd lengths to avoid admitting two truths: that Greece is bust; and that north Europeans (and Mrs Merkel's thrifty Germans in particular) will end up footing a good part of the bill, either by transferring money to the south or by bailing out their own banks. They have failed to undertake a serious restructuring: the current rescue package reduces Greece's debt, but not by enough to give it a genuine chance of recovery (see page
). As a result, Greece, and maybe other peripheral European countries too, will need another bail-out sooner or later. Just as in Japan, politicians have failed to make the structural labour- and product-market reforms essential to spurring growth. If this deal spawns a fiscal union within Europe, as it may well, that will not be because Mrs Merkel and her peers took a bold, strategic and transparent decision to create one, but because they ran away from more immediate forms of pain (see page
).
America's debt debate seems still more kabuki-like. Its fiscal problem is not now--it should be spending to boost recovery--but in the medium term. Its absurdly complicated tax system raises very little, and the ageing of its baby-boomers will push its vast entitlement programmes towards bankruptcy. Mr Obama set up a commission to examine this issue and until recently completely ignored its sensible conclusions. The president also stuck too long to the fiction that the deficit can be plugged by taxing the rich more: he even wasted part of a national broadcast this week bashing the wealthy, though the Democrats had already withdrawn proposals for such rises.
Yet Mr Obama and his party seem a model of fiscal statesmanship compared with their Republican opponents. Once upon a time the American right led the world when it came to rethinking government; now it is an intellectual pygmy. The House Republicans could not even get their budget sums right, so the vote had to be delayed. A desire to curb Leviathan is admirable, but the tea-partiers live in a fantasy world in which the deficit can be reduced without any tax increases: even Mr Obama's attempts to remove loopholes in the tax code drive the zealots into paroxysms of outrage.
In both Europe and America electorates seem to be turning inward. There is the same division between ""ins"" and ""outs"" that has plagued Japan. In Europe one set of middle-class workers is desperate to hang on to protections and privileges: millions of others are stuck in unprotected temporary jobs or are unemployed. In both Europe and America well-connected public-sector unions obstruct progress. And then there is the greatest (and also the least sustainable) division of all: between the old, clinging tightly to entitlements they claim to have earned, and the young who will somehow have to pay for all this. Is that Mount Fuji I see?
Sometimes crises beget bold leadership. Not, unfortunately, now. Japan has mostly been led by a string of weak consensus-seekers. For all their talents, both Mr Obama and Mrs Merkel are better at following public opinion than leading it. 
The problem lies not just in the personalities involved, but also in the political structures. Japan's dysfunctional politics were rooted in its one-party system: petty factionalism has survived both the Liberal Democratic Party's resounding defeat in 2009 and the recent tsunami (see
). In America's Congress the moderate centre--conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans--has collapsed, in part because partisan redistricting has handed over power to the extremes. In Europe national politicians, answerable to their own electorates, are struggling to confront continent-wide problems.
Autocrats need not sneer at the troubles of Western democracies. The problems the latter face would tax any government; and, as the Asian financial crisis a decade ago showed, dictatorships are often worse at distributing pain. Moreover, Western politics is less broken than many allege. Since 2009 Congress has passed a huge stimulus and the health-care bill, both controversial yet also evidence that the legislature can get things done. For all their petty foolishness, the Republicans are bringing issues like tax reform and entitlements into the national debate. Outside the euro zone--in Britain, and in the Baltic republics, for instance--politicians have implemented reforms and austerity programmes with admirable speed.
Our views on what the West should do will be painfully familiar to readers. Europe's politicians need to implement not just a serious restructuring of the peripheral countries' debts but also a serious reform of their economies, to clean out cronyism, corruption and all the inefficiencies that hold back their growth. America's Democrats need to accept entitlement cuts and Republicans higher taxes. Independent commissions should set electoral boundaries. And so on. 
Japan's politicians had umpteen chances to change course; and the longer they avoided doing so, the harder it became. Their peers in the West should heed that example.","The absence of leadership in the West is frightening--and also rather familiar
A GOVERNMENT'S credibility is founded on its commitment to honour its debts. As a result of the dramas of the past few weeks, that crucial commodity is eroding in the West. The struggles in Europe to keep Greece in the euro zone and the brinkmanship in America over the debt ceiling have presented investors with an unattractive choice: should you buy the currency that may default, or the one that could disintegrate? 
In the early days of the economic crisis the West's leaders did a reasonable job of clearing up a mess that was only partly of their making. Now the politicians have become the problem. In both America and Europe, they are exhibiting the sort of behaviour that could turn a downturn into stagnation. The West's leaders are not willing to make tough choices; and everybody--the markets, the leaders of the emerging world, the banks, even the voters--knows it. It is a mark of how low expectations have sunk that the euro zone's half-rescue of Greece on July 21st was greeted with relief. As The Economist went to press, it still was not clear on what terms America's debt limit would be raised, and for how long. Even if the current crises abate or are averted, the real danger persists: that the West's political system cannot take the difficult decisions needed to recover from a crisis and prosper in the years ahead.
The world has seen this before. Two decades ago, Japan's economic bubble popped; since then its leaders have procrastinated and postured. The years of political paralysis have done Japan more harm than the economic excesses of the 1980s. Its economy has barely grown and its regional influence has withered. As a proportion of GDP, its gross public debt is the highest in the world, twice America's and nearly twice Italy's. If something similar were to happen to its fellow democracies in Europe and America, the consequences would be far larger. No wonder China's autocrats, flush with cash and an (only partly deserved) reputation for getting things done, feel as if the future is on their side. Yes, you Kan, if you carry on like this
Though both about debt, the arguments in Europe and America have very different origins. The euro crisis was brought on by investors with genuine worries about the solvency of several euro-zone countries. By contrast the stand-off in Washington is a political creation, thrust upon initially incredulous investors (see page
). Increasing America's overdraft beyond $14.3 trillion should have been relatively simple. But Republican congressmen, furious about big government, have recklessly used it as a political tool to embarrass Barack Obama.
The similarity between the European and American dramas lies in the protagonists' refusal to face reality. European politicians, led by Angela Merkel, have gone to absurd lengths to avoid admitting two truths: that Greece is bust; and that north Europeans (and Mrs Merkel's thrifty Germans in particular) will end up footing a good part of the bill, either by transferring money to the south or by bailing out their own banks. They have failed to undertake a serious restructuring: the current rescue package reduces Greece's debt, but not by enough to give it a genuine chance of recovery (see page
). As a result, Greece, and maybe other peripheral European countries too, will need another bail-out sooner or later. Just as in Japan, politicians have failed to make the structural labour- and product-market reforms essential to spurring growth. If this deal spawns a fiscal union within Europe, as it may well, that will not be because Mrs Merkel and her peers took a bold, strategic and transparent decision to create one, but because they ran away from more immediate forms of pain (see page
).
America's debt debate seems still more kabuki-like. Its fiscal problem is not now--it should be spending to boost recovery--but in the medium term. Its absurdly complicated tax system raises very little, and the ageing of its baby-boomers will push its vast entitlement programmes towards bankruptcy. Mr Obama set up a commission to examine this issue and until recently completely ignored its sensible conclusions. The president also stuck too long to the fiction that the deficit can be plugged by taxing the rich more: he even wasted part of a national broadcast this week bashing the wealthy, though the Democrats had already withdrawn proposals for such rises.
Yet Mr Obama and his party seem a model of fiscal statesmanship compared with their Republican opponents. Once upon a time the American right led the world when it came to rethinking government; now it is an intellectual pygmy. The House Republicans could not even get their budget sums right, so the vote had to be delayed. A desire to curb Leviathan is admirable, but the tea-partiers live in a fantasy world in which the deficit can be reduced without any tax increases: even Mr Obama's attempts to remove loopholes in the tax code drive the zealots into paroxysms of outrage.
In both Europe and America electorates seem to be turning inward. There is the same division between ""ins"" and ""outs"" that has plagued Japan. In Europe one set of middle-class workers is desperate to hang on to protections and privileges: millions of others are stuck in unprotected temporary jobs or are unemployed. In both Europe and America well-connected public-sector unions obstruct progress. And then there is the greatest (and also the least sustainable) division of all: between the old, clinging tightly to entitlements they claim to have earned, and the young who will somehow have to pay for all this. Is that Mount Fuji I see?
Sometimes crises beget bold leadership. Not, unfortunately, now. Japan has mostly been led by a string of weak consensus-seekers. For all their talents, both Mr Obama and Mrs Merkel are better at following public opinion than leading it. 
The problem lies not just in the personalities involved, but also in the political structures. Japan's dysfunctional politics were rooted in its one-party system: petty factionalism has survived both the Liberal Democratic Party's resounding defeat in 2009 and the recent tsunami (see
). In America's Congress the moderate centre--conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans--has collapsed, in part because partisan redistricting has handed over power to the extremes. In Europe national politicians, answerable to their own electorates, are struggling to confront continent-wide problems.
Autocrats need not sneer at the troubles of Western democracies. The problems the latter face would tax any government; and, as the Asian financial crisis a decade ago showed, dictatorships are often worse at distributing pain.

ALREADY enduring its sixth prime minister in five years, Japan is overdue a seventh.

For both the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and his comrades in the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) the way he is lingering over his departure is exasperating.
For rival politicians (a category that includes virtually all of them), it is also rather frightening. As Japan struggles to cope with the disaster at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant, Mr Kan has nailed his colours to the anti-nuclear mast, arguing that Japan needs to reduce its dependence on atomic energy. Oddly he later watered this down, by saying he was only expressing a personal view not a government policy. But other politicians fear that, rather than quit, he may call an election, campaign on the future of the nuclear industry and (such is the popular hostility to it) win. Goshi Hosono, an avowedly pro-nuclear DPJ technocrat whom Mr Kan appointed as minister in charge of the nuclear mess, says it is ""not a good idea"" to test the public on this issue.
This week Mr Kan said he had no intention of dissolving parliament early, arguing that the public would not like it and that it would be better to wait until 2013. Even that did not entirely quash rumours that he may use the anniversary on August 6th of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima to make a dramatic anti-nuclear gesture.
A snap election would seem out of character. But Mr Kan has still not set a date for his departure. At the end of June he listed three conditions he wanted met before standing down. One was fulfilled this week, with the passage of a {Yen}2 trillion ($26 billion) supplementary budget to help pay for recovery from the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March. There is also some progress on the second condition, a law covering the setting of feed-in tariffs for electricity, to encourage the development of renewable energy.
The third, passage of legislation enabling the government to borrow to finance its deficit, may be trickier. In an echo of the showdown in Washington, DC, the LDP wants Mr Kan to drop some of the DPJ's spending promises--such as an allowance for raising children, and the abolition of expressway tolls and tuition fees for public high schools.
Even if that dispute is resolved, Mr Kan may still try to hang on after the end of this parliamentary session on August 31st. This seems remarkable. The political class loathes him; the press relentlessly reviles him; business despises him; and voters want him to go. His approval rating has plummeted to below 20%. 
One of his advisers, however, points out that most other politicians score even lower in the polls. Mr Kan's unpopularity is a symptom of a deeper problem: a loss of faith in politics generally. Partisan and intra-party bickering at a time of national emergency has further battered politics' reputation. Mr Kan's government is widely seen as having been inept in disaster-management, and its standing will sink deeper if, as many expect, scares about nuclear-tainted food worsen. 
Japan badly needs effective government. The clean-up from the tsunami and earthquake has been impressive. But rebuilding has yet to begin, because big and urgent decisions about what to rebuild where have yet to be taken. Mr Kan's team hardly seems up to the job. But few believe a replacement would be much better. 
Desperate to get rid of him, some of his colleagues are whispering of their own weapon of mass destruction: the collective resignation of the cabinet and DPJ hierarchy.

FOR the frequent visitor since the catastrophe, the progress looks remarkable. Much of the tenacious sludge that inundated the area has been scrubbed painstakingly away. In some obliterated towns, shops are open and stocked and have electricity. Roads are cleared, lined by man-made hills of rubble. Wrecked cars, crumpled like empty beer cans, are neatly stacked. On higher ground, smart colonies of shoebox-shaped prefabricated ""temporary housing"" are springing up.
But for someone coming to the desolation for the first time, what still astounds is the sheer scale of the devastation wrought by the tsunami on March 11th; that, and the enormous obstacles in the way of rebuilding whole villages and towns. Take the former port of Onagawa, which nestled in a cove at the foot of the Oshika peninsula, near the city of Ishinomaki in Miyagi prefecture. It was an attractive little place, and prosperous from whaling, fishing, fish-processing and the benefits of having a nuclear power plant just 16km (10 miles) up the coast. 
Of its 10,000 inhabitants, the local government says 830 were left dead or missing. Almost all that remains of the town is a modern hospital, on a hill some 60 metres above the port. As the tsunami approached, people drove to the car park there to watch--in terrified awe, but in presumed safety. Then the water swept up the valley and the hill behind them--and back down through the ground floor of the hospital, dragging patients, and the cars and people in front, out to sea.
As everywhere along the coast, there are now mountains of debris. The prefectural government says that two-fifths has been cleared in Miyagi, and that in total there was the equivalent of 23 years of ""general waste"". It looks much more than that. There is nowhere for it to go, so the rubble is either staying put or, like the people, moving into temporary holding areas. There it will one day be sifted and recycled or discarded.
During the earthquake, the ground level dropped by a metre, while the tsunami destroyed Onagawa's sea wall. At high tide each day much of the town is now underwater. The hospital reception posts the times of high tide, to save visitors from being stranded. So before rebuilding houses, shops and factories, the sea wall will have to be restored and heightened, and the ground raised. Higher sites have to be found inland for people to live. Nobutaka Azumi, Onagawa's mayor, at work on a Sunday in impressive temporary offices put up since the disaster, states the obvious when he says rebuilding will be ""very expensive"". He does not know whether the money will be available.
That uncertainty is mirrored everywhere in the afflicted Tohoku region. On July 29th the government of Naoto Kan, the prime minister, announced a plan to spend {Yen}19 trillion ($220 billion) on rebuilding over the next five years. It was endorsing a report published in June by a Reconstruction Design Council that it had appointed. 
The document, ""Towards Reconstruction: Hope beyond the Disaster"", is a sensible set of guidelines for deciding what should be rebuilt and where. But it implies countless individual decisions, each involving contentious choices. Just before the government's announcement, Jun Iio of the council told an Economist conference in Tokyo that reconstruction will be ""in full spate"" in five years and complete in ten. 
Tempering that optimism were his three reasons, besides the sheer magnitude of the task and a likely tussle for the power to allocate reconstruction funds, why reconstruction will be so difficult. One is Japan's ageing, shrinking population. In Tohoku the outflow of young people has been accelerated by the disaster, which destroyed local industries. This is a chance to rebuild for Japan's new demographic structure. But planning for that adds an additional layer of complexity.
Second is the nuclear disaster at Fukushima. The government has sought a reckoning, by sacking officials in charge of nuclear safety. But the stricken reactors have yet to be stabilised and decommissioned, and the surrounding area decontaminated. More generally, Japan will have to adopt a new energy policy in the face of popular hostility to nuclear power. Onagawa's plant was high enough above sea level to survive the tsunami without enormous damage. Indeed, the facility provided shelter for some of the homeless, and is said to have been the first place to receive food supplies after the tsunami. But the nuclear plant is still shut down, and locals have mixed feelings about it restarting.
Mr Iio also cited Japan's twin problems of slow economic growth and a vast fiscal deficit. The government's announcement on July 29th had been expected to include a temporary tax increase to pay for reconstruction. With gross public debt at 200% of GDP, the fear is that the government will be unable to go on borrowing for ever. Yet no tax rise was announced. Many in Mr Kan's own party, as well as the opposition, reject any tax increase. Partly this is out of fear it would push Japan back into recession. But the issue has also become embroiled in a political battle to get rid of Mr Kan--who promised in June to stand down yet still clings on. So Japan's poisonous national politics are the third reason for gloom about the speed of reconstruction. For whom the phone tolls
For Kuniko Yoshida, a resolutely cheerful old lady in an evacuation centre in a school gymnasium in Kesennuma, north of Onagawa, the delay is already irksome. She lost everything on March 11th. Now, sitting on a mat in her two square metres of floor space walled by cardboard boxes, she is waiting for a promised call to tell her if she has been allocated an escape from the gym, into temporary housing. When her telephone rings, friends from around the centre prick up their ears. It is a false alarm: her sister calling for news. The excitement is understandable. Mrs Yoshida's ""temporary"" next home may well be her last.","Many victims of Japan 's earthquake and tsunami will never see their homes rebuilt

After police were criticised for yielding control of the streets to thugs, David Cameron returned from his holiday and promised a robust response.

FOR those who despair of Japan's politics, the prospect of a leadership contest between a trainspotter, a cabinet minister who burst into tears in parliament and somebody who exonerates war criminals might sound depressing. But since the prime minister, Naoto Kan, revealed that he would step down on August 30th, the trainspotter has set things alight.

Several times this summer, as the unpopular Mr Kan wavered over whether to quit or not, Mr Maehara indicated that he would not run, so his decision comes as a surprise. If he wins, he will represent a refreshing new generation of modernisers. But so fractious is the DPJ, little can be taken for granted.
Between Mr Maehara and the prime minister's job stand a handful of less inspiring rivals and one burly obstacle, Ichiro Ozawa, a divisive figure who controls the DPJ's biggest faction (and who has been indicted in a funding scandal). Of the party's 398 lawmakers who can vote on Mr Kan's replacement on August 29th, he leads a group of some 130, compared with Mr Maehara's 40. Mr Ozawa's attacks on Mr Kan helped to bring him down and nearly split the party. As The Economist went to press, he remained non-committal about Mr Maehara, but in the past the two men have been firmly at odds.
Mr Maehara's task is a delicate one. If he courts Mr Ozawa, he will put off many of his supporters. ""Some people, including me, regard Mr Ozawa as the symbol of old politics,"" says Keisuke Tsumura, a DPJ lawmaker. But the party's anti-Ozawa camp is also split, because Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, may also run and he shares some supporters with Mr Maehara. 
None of the main hopefuls is without blemish. Mr Maehara blundered during a brief stint as opposition leader five years ago, and he quit as foreign minister in March over a fuss about an illegal donation from a Korean woman. Mr Noda lacks charisma, and recently issued a bizarre exoneration of war criminals. Banri Kaieda, the trade minister, did nothing for his chances when he broke down in tears under opposition attack.
The new prime minister will be the sixth since Junichiro Koizumi--the last with either charisma or authority--stepped down in 2006. Mr Maehara is the best chance the DPJ has of somebody even approaching Mr Koizumi's stature.

FIVE months after a tsunami and nuclear meltdown assailed Japan, the economy has been pummelled by fresh blows. Share prices have followed global stockmarkets down, with the Nikkei 225 index revisiting its nadir in the days after the earthquake in March. As if the fears about a global slowdown that have depressed equity investors were not enough, the yen has been soaring, which will hurt Japanese exporters. Adding to the pain, Moody's, a credit-rating agency, downgraded Japan's debt rating one notch to Aa3 on August 24th because of its huge public debt and chaotic politics. 
Yet amid the gloom the outlook for a robust recovery has actually been brightening. Private economists are forecasting a boom in 2012 and 2013, as the rebuilding of the devastated Tohoku region in north-eastern Japan acts as a big stimulus, which will offset slower growth in America and Europe. Official estimates put the damage at between {Yen}16 trillion and {Yen}25 trillion ($210 billion-330 billion). The government has already budgeted for {Yen}6 trillion to pay for reconstruction, which has yet to kick in. An additional stimulus package, perhaps as large as {Yen}10 trillion, is being debated in the Japanese parliament. The surge in public spending means that Japan is almost certain to resume growth in the second half of this year. 
One auspicious sign is that the economy did rather better in the second quarter of 2011 than had been feared. The recession continued, as GDP fell for the third successive quarter. But the contraction of 0.3% (an annualised fall of 1.3%) from the first quarter was half the rate that had been predicted. The main reason for the weakness was that exports declined by almost 5% because of power shortages and the disruptions to the supply chain that followed the disastrous events of March 11th. 
These impediments to growth are being removed but a fresh cause for concern is the strengthening yen. The government is striving to prevent this but the fretting may be overdone. In nominal terms, the value of the yen is hitting new highs. But in real terms, taking into account Japan's persistent deflation and inflation elsewhere, the yen is in line with its average over the past two decades (see chart). That is one reason why Japanese manufacturers have continued to make decent profits. Companies gripe that the strong yen may push them to move operations overseas. Yet they are heading there anyway, to be closer to consumers in faster-growing markets. 
Japan's reconstruction will provide a fillip just when the country needs it. Still, the extra borrowing this will entail is a big worry for an economy whose government debt will reach more than 230% of GDP this year, according to the IMF--far higher even than that of beleaguered Greece. Japan has been able to finance its borrowing at very low interest rates, but getting a grip on its woeful public finances is crucial for its long-term future. 
Unfortunately, the political outlook is worse than the economic one. Naoto Kan, the prime minister, steps down at the end of August.

ANOTHER year, another prime minister. Yoshihiko Noda has become the sixth Japanese prime minister since the lion-maned Junichiro Koizumi stepped down in 2006. Mr Koizumi's five dazzling years in office now seem like a golden era, followed only by political dysfunction: divided parties, a string of mediocre men and a confused, disillusioned electorate. Mr Noda will prove no mould-breaker. He admits his mediocrity, while comparing his bulging looks to those of the bottom-dwelling loach (see
). Before he is dismissed as yet another has-been, at least it can be said that he has a nicely self-deprecating turn of wit.
Other qualities should also be noted. Mr Noda, a former finance minister, has a keen sense of the swamp in which Japan is mired, with low growth, a national debt twice the size of the economy, an ageing population and a dwindling workforce. On top of that comes cleaning up after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11th, which destroyed a swathe of the north-east, led to a nuclear emergency and threw Japan's energy policy into disarray. In contrast to his immediate predecessor, Naoto Kan, Mr Noda is a conciliator, both within his fractious party and towards the opposition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Perhaps his greatest asset is that, commanding so little faith, he will not succumb to inflated expectations.
Yet Japan's problems are far beyond any single person's ability to solve. A return to the golden era is certainly not the answer: it is now clear that Mr Koizumi danced atop an edifice, dominated for half a century by the LDP, that was about to crumble regardless. In 2009 voters swept the edifice away and put the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in power: an historic moment, bringing the hope of a new age of competitive, two-party politics. No one should mourn the ""LDP system"", with its corruption and back-room dealing, and its capacity to smother the countryside in concrete.
But the DPJ has disappointed mightily, first under the leadership of Yukio Hatoyama, a space cadet, and then under the divisive, indecisive Mr Kan. One problem is that a callow party declared war on the very bureaucrats needed to keep any country running. Mr Noda must now make peace with them. He must encourage them to help come up with sound ideas, while also not undermining the implementation of policies they do not like. Do or Diet
Meanwhile, far from offering something new, the DPJ has taken on the trappings of the old LDP. Lacking an ideological anchor, bickering factions are the DPJ's chief organising principle. Once, during the economic growth of the LDP's heyday, the factions had a point, spreading patronage to get the compromises needed for the sake of governing. Today, factions simply maintain their power to thwart. The leader of the DPJ's biggest and most obstructive faction, Ichiro Ozawa, a grizzled wheeler-dealer, was dealt a blow by Mr Noda's victory. But if the conciliatory Mr Noda feels obliged to bring Ozawa forces into government, party modernisation may take a back seat. Factions are a chief impediment to the new politics towards which Japan is groping.
The other impediment is constitutional. Post-war arrangements did not really envisage opposing parties controlling separate chambers of the two-house Diet. The constitution gives the upper house near equal powers to the lower one. Last year voters angry with Mr Kan elected an upper house controlled by the opposition. Since then the LDP has declared war on all government policy--the victims of the March 11th disaster go hang. Mr Noda should call for a truce in which the essentials of how to rebuild the north-east are worked out, and a modus operandi in the upper house is reached. Anyone in the LDP who reflects on how savagely voters might punish the party's obstructionism at the polls should favour this. 
That Japan keeps going at all is no thanks to its politicians, but to a peaceable, cohesive people, one able to endure much, as the response to the tsunami vividly shows. But the flip side is unhealthy: apathy or cynicism towards the country's politics, and a reluctance by voters to make hard choices, such as accepting a rise in the consumption tax in order to ease the coming fiscal burden on the young. If Mr Noda fails to move the political system forward, then he should not hand over to the next grey man, but seek a political realignment and throw the matter back to voters in a general election.","What ails the political system is greater than one man , but Yoshihiko Noda can make a start

ON MOST mornings of his political career until he became finance minister last year, Yoshihiko Noda doggedly courted voters at the railway station near his home in this commuter town east of Tokyo. Known for its IKEA store and little else, Funabashi is to Tokyo what Romford and Jersey City are to London and New York--a place even locals make jokes about. Mr Noda started out with none of the three ban, or attributes, aspiring politicians are meant to possess: an inherited constituency, prestige and bags of money. So he stumped every working day for almost 25 years to build a name for himself.
On August 30th it paid off. Mr Noda became prime minister, replacing Naoto Kan, who was forced out after 14 tumultuous months. The 54-year-old black belt in judo is the sixth new leader in five years; he risks being laughed off even before he starts. What is more, so little known in Japan is Mr Noda that a week earlier supporters were telling him to quit the race to replace Mr Kan as president of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), especially once his more photogenic ally, Seiji Maehara, a former foreign minister, broke a promise not to run against him.
Yet using skills honed at Funabashi station, Mr Noda pulled off what supporters call a miracle. His speech to parliamentarians of the ruling party before they voted for a leader was unusual for a Japanese politician. He spoke plainly, exuding honesty and consistency. And he made people laugh, comparing his puffy appearance to that of a loach, a fish that loves mud.
In a second-round vote, victory was assured when one of the candidates he defeated in the first round took off his jacket. That signalled to the politician's followers that they should cast their run-off vote for Mr Noda, rather than the puppet candidate of Ichiro Ozawa, the party's indicted (and suspended) kingpin. Mr Noda romped home, 215 votes to 177. But supporters say his speech also contained a coded message aimed at healing a paralysing rift in the party between those for and against Mr Ozawa. The loach reference was taken from one of the favourite poems of Azuma Koshiishi, a 75-year-old elder in the DPJ who is close to Mr Ozawa, with rare influence over him. It was a deftly cast fly. Soon after Mr Noda was named prime minister, he persuaded Mr Koshiishi to become secretary-general of the party. That put the onus on Mr Ozawa to bury the hatchet.
Mr Noda's supporters insist that his urgency in ending the DPJ's infighting is because Mr Noda has a strong sense of crisis. He wants to put aside intra- and cross-party rivalries in order to secure funding for reconstruction of the tsunami-ravaged regions of north-east Japan. He wants to stabilise the Fukushima nuclear power plant, around which levels of radiation are proving higher than expected, and may create large, semi-permanent no-go zones, just as at Chernobyl. And Mr Noda is deeply concerned about Japan's fiscal health, not flinching from his bold but controversial stance in favour of higher taxes.
The new prime minister is also a foreign-policy hawk. In a recent article he described Japan's alliance with America as ""the greatest asset we have""--though such is Washington's exasperation with the DPJ and its flip-flopping policies that he can hardly expect the red-carpet treatment from President Barack Obama when he travels to the United States in mid-September for the UN General Assembly.
Mr Noda is more circumspect about China, which he describes as both an opportunity and a risk for Japan. South Korea has recently complained about his long-held views extolling the honour of Japan's convicted war criminals. But Akihisa Nagashima, one of his advisers, says he does not expect Mr Noda, the son of an officer, to let his own views undermine Japan's national interest. He says the prime minister is unlikely to visit the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan's war dead, including Class A war criminals. Such a visit would incense Japan's neighbours.
However tenacious he is, Mr Noda faces two hurdles. First, the DPJ is, in the words of Mr Nagashima, ""like Afghanistan"": a collection of tribes revolving around loyalty to a few individuals rather than a common set of ideas. Arguably, there are more ideological differences within the party than with its rival, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which governed Japan for most of the half-century to 2009. Unlike the LDP, the ruling party lacks well-worn conventions, so policy can easily fall prey to bullying individuals. Mr Noda is seeking to deal with this by rehabilitating his wonkish friend, Mr Maehara, as the party's policy chief.
Second, the LDP can block much of Mr Noda's legislative platform because of a debilitating feature of Japanese politics: the power of the upper house of the Diet (parliament). Though the DPJ is the largest party in the upper house, with 106 seats, it lacks a majority there. The LDP and its ally, New Komeito, can muster enough support from other parties to cause gridlock.
Koichi Nakano, a political scientist, says the electoral arithmetic suggests this situation could last for another five years at least. Whoever wins the lower house at the next general election, due by 2013, is unlikely to hold a majority in the upper house.
To avoid gridlock, Mr Noda intends assiduously to court the LDP. For now, the party is offering to co-operate with him on disaster relief--more than they did for Mr Kan. However, its leaders still drone on about the need to dissolve the lower house. They see that as their quickest route back to power. And to hasten dissolution, they may once again use legislative paralysis, just as they did to destroy Mr Kan.","A straight - talker takes over , but can he overcome the crisis of governability ? 
 ON MOST mornings of his political career until he became finance minister last year , Yoshihiko Noda doggedly courted voters at the railway station near his home in this commuter town east of Tokyo . Known for its IKEA store and little else , Funabashi is to Tokyo what Romford and Jersey City are to London and New York -- a place even locals make jokes about . Mr Noda started out with none of the three ban , or attributes , aspiring politicians are meant to possess : an inherited constituency , prestige and bags of money . So he stumped every working day for almost 25 years to build a name for himself . 
 On August 30th it paid off . Mr Noda became prime minister , replacing Naoto Kan . The 54 - year - old black belt in judo is the sixth new leader in five years ; he risks being laughed off even before he starts . What is more , so little known in Japan is Mr Noda that a week earlier supporters were telling him to quit the race to replace Naoto Kan as president of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , especially once his more photogenic ally , Seiji Maehara , a former foreign minister , broke a promise not to run against him . 
 Yet using skills honed at Funabashi station , Mr Noda pulled off what supporters call a miracle . His speech to parliamentarians of the ruling party before they voted for a leader was unusual for a Japanese politician . He spoke plainly , exuding honesty and consistency . And he made people laugh , comparing his puffy appearance to that of a loach , a fish that loves mud . 
 In a second - round vote , victory was assured when one of the candidates he defeated in the first round took off his jacket . That signalled to the politician 's followers that they should cast their run - off vote for Mr Noda , rather than the puppet candidate of Ichiro Ozawa , the party 's indicted ( and suspended ) kingpin . Mr Noda romped home , 215 votes to 177 . But supporters say his speech also contained a coded message aimed at healing a paralysing rift in the party between those for and against Mr Ozawa . The loach reference was taken from one of the favourite poems of Azuma Koshiishi , a 75 - year - old elder in the DPJ who is close to Mr Ozawa , with rare influence over him . It was a deftly cast fly . Soon after Mr Noda was named prime minister , he persuaded Mr Koshiishi to become secretary - general of the party . That put the onus on Mr Ozawa to bury the hatchet . 
 Mr Noda 's supporters insist that his urgency in ending the DPJ 's infighting is because Mr Noda has a strong sense of crisis . He wants to put aside intra- and cross - party rivalries in order to secure funding for reconstruction of the tsunami - ravaged regions of north - east Japan . He wants to stabilise the Fukushima nuclear power plant , around which levels of radiation are proving higher than expected , and may create large , semi - permanent no - go zones , just as at Chernobyl . And Mr Noda is deeply concerned about Japan 's fiscal health , not flinching from his bold but controversial stance in favour of higher taxes . 
 The new prime minister is also a foreign - policy hawk . In a recent article he described Japan 's alliance with America as "" the greatest asset we have""--though such is Washington 's exasperation with the DPJ and its flip - flopping policies that he can hardly expect the red - carpet treatment from President Barack Obama when he travels to the United States in mid - September for the UN General Assembly . 
 Mr Noda is more circumspect about China , which he describes as both an opportunity and a risk for Japan . South Korea has recently complained about his long - held views extolling the honour of Japan 's convicted war criminals . But Akihisa Nagashima , one of his advisers , says he does not expect Mr Noda , the son of an officer , to let his own views undermine Japan 's national interest . He says the prime minister is unlikely to visit the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan 's war dead , including Class A war criminals . Such a visit would incense Japan 's neighbours . 
 However tenacious he is , Mr Noda faces two hurdles . First , the DPJ is , in the words of Mr Nagashima , "" like Afghanistan "" : a collection of tribes revolving around loyalty to a few individuals rather than a common set of ideas . Arguably , there are more ideological differences within the party than with its rival , the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which governed Japan for most of the half - century to 2009 . Unlike the LDP , the ruling party lacks well - worn conventions , so policy can easily fall prey to bullying individuals . Mr Noda is seeking to deal with this by rehabilitating his wonkish friend , Mr Maehara , as the party 's policy chief . 
 Second , the LDP can block much of Mr Noda 's legislative platform because of a debilitating feature of Japanese politics : the power of the upper house of the Diet ( parliament ) . Though the DPJ is the largest party in the upper house , with 106 seats , it lacks a majority there . The LDP and its ally , New Komeito , can muster enough support from other parties to cause gridlock . 
 Koichi Nakano , a political scientist , says the electoral arithmetic suggests this situation could last for another five years at least . Whoever wins the lower house at the next general election , due by 2013 , is unlikely to hold a majority in the upper house . 
 To avoid gridlock , Mr Noda intends assiduously to court the LDP . For now , the party is offering to co - operate with him on disaster relief -- more than they did for Naoto Kan However , its leaders still drone on about the need to dissolve the lower house . They see that as their quickest route back to power . And to hasten dissolution , they may once again use legislative paralysis , just as they did to destroy Naoto Kan",740,Japan,A30-187,IN TERM,True,"Naoto Kan , who was forced out after 14 tumultuous months",4,True

THE corridors were dark, the air uncomfortably hot. The lights at the headquarters of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) were largely switched off; the air-conditioners were turned down. Even the chief executive, Toshio Nishizawa, had removed his tie for an interview on September 5th. In normal times, that would be a glaring breach of Japanese corporate etiquette, but these are not normal times. 
Since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11th, most nuclear reactors in Japan have been shut down for maintenance and not restarted: 43 out of 54 remain idle. There has been a national drive for setsuden (conserving energy). TEPCO must be seen to share the pain. 
The company is staggeringly unpopular. One of its nuclear plants at Fukushima was damaged on March 11th. In the crucial hours after the tsunami, TEPCO failed to add water to cool the reactor cores. It was unable to restore steady back-up power until days later and inexplicably delayed venting a build-up of pressure that eventually led to hydrogen explosions. 
As if that were not bad enough, TEPCO withheld information from everyone, including the then prime minister, Naoto Kan, who stormed into its headquarters yelling: ""What the hell is going on?"" A meltdown began several hours after the tsunami struck, but wasn't officially disclosed until nine weeks later. ""We have lost trust,"" admits Mr Nishizawa. Regaining it will take ""a long, long time"", he adds. 
Asked whether the reactor was damaged by the quake itself (as distinct from the tsunami that followed it), Mr Nishizawa says it is unclear: we must wait for a report in November. This question matters. If the reactors in quake-prone Japan are not quake-proof, nuclear power may not be safe. An official at a nuclear regulator says there is evidence that the quake did indeed damage the reactor.
Since the disaster, Japanese people have made heroic efforts to save energy. Households snuffed out lights and unplugged their heated toilet seats. Big companies reduced their energy use by 15% (on pain of fines). Many began the workday earlier or switched to night shifts. The car industry took Thursdays and Fridays off and toiled at weekends, when electricity demand is lower. In TEPCO's region (around Tokyo), peak usage fell to 49 gigawatts, from 60 gigawatts last year. Everyone expected blackouts; none occurred. On September 9th, as the summer's heat faded, the government announced an end to setsuden. 
Yet Japan's energy problems are far from resolved. If the nuclear freeze lasts for a year, it will cut GDP by an estimated 3.6% and destroy almost 200,000 jobs. Meanwhile, three-fifths of the public say they have little confidence in nuclear power. 
Japan needs a robust and diverse energy industry. Instead it has ten regional monopolies (TEPCO is one), which hog 97% of the market for electricity generation and transmission. Residential consumers pay nearly twice as much as Americans and three times as much as South Koreans (see chart). After modest deregulation began for big commercial users a decade ago, prices plummeted by 16% between 1999 and 2005. Yet lacking political support, the reforms went into reverse. 
Electricity prices are high because the monopolies have little incentive to cut costs. On the contrary, their profit margins are fixed by the government, so if they inflate their costs, they boost their income. At the same time, the utilities charge residential consumers a flat rate, giving them no incentive to run appliances during off-peak hours. Alternative energy gets short shrift. Although Japanese firms are leaders in green technologies such as wind, solar and geothermal, these sources account for only 1% of all power generation.
TEPCO's influence is vast. It supports politicians from one party; its union supports their rivals. It finances academic research on energy. It takes hacks on junkets. And last year it spent {Yen}26 billion ($339m) on advertising and promotion--a fortune for a firm with no serious competitors. 
Reformers urge the break-up of Japan's power monopolies. Separating generation from transmission and opening the door to new entrants would raise efficiency and reduce costs. However, Keidanren, the lobby for big business, opposes deregulation on the ground that TEPCO and its ilk ensure a stable supply of electricity. Several Keidanren members sell parts and services to the power monopolies, and receive steep discounts on the power they use. 
Many politicians believe that TEPCO must be preserved so it can compensate the victims of the nuclear accident at Fukushima. A law governing compensation was approved by the Diet on August 3rd. It creates a mechanism to collect funds from TEPCO and other power firms but fails to specify how the costs will be shared. On September 12th TEPCO sent out forms for evacuees to fill in. These are 60 pages long. 
The new government of Yoshihiko Noda wants to reduce Japan's reliance on nuclear power in the medium term, but hopes to restart idle reactors in the meantime. Without cheap, reliable power, businesses may move abroad. 
New firms are clamouring to enter the energy business. Masayoshi Son, a wireless tycoon, plans to build huge solar-power stations and a new grid to connect Japanese prefectures. But the regulatory process is a nightmare, he says. A new law on green energy gives few clues as to how new producers can sell power to the grid, or whether the incumbents have to buy it. Not even an earthquake, it seems, can shake the monopolists' grip.","Japan's power monopolies raise costs and stifle innovation

THERE is a breathtaking serenity to the valley that winds from the town of Namie, on the coast of Fukushima prefecture, into the hills above. A narrow road runs by a river that passes through steep ravines, studded with maples. Lovely it may be, but it is the last place where you would want to see an exodus of 8,000 people fleeing meltdowns at a nearby nuclear-power plant. 
Along that switchback road the day after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11th 2011, it took Namie's residents more than three hours to drive 30km (19 miles) to what they thought was the relative safety of Tsushima, a secluded hamlet. What they did not know was that they were heading into an invisible fog of radioactive matter that has made this one of the worst radiation hotspots in Japan--far worse than the town they abandoned, just ten minutes' drive from the gates of the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant. It was not until a New York Times report in August that many of the evacuees realised they had been exposed to such a danger, thanks to government neglect. 
Negligence forms the backdrop for the first government-commissioned report into the Fukushima nuclear disaster, released in late December. Although only an interim assessment (the complete report is due in the summer), it is already 500 pages long and the product of hundreds of interviews. A casual reader might be put off by the technical detail and the dearth of personal narrative. Yet by Japanese standards it is gripping. It spares neither the government nor Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), the operator of the nuclear plant. It reveals at times an almost cartoon-like level of incompetence. Whether it is enough to reassure an insecure public that lessons will be learnt is another matter. 
Since the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, it has become axiomatic to assume that complex systems fail in complex ways. That was broadly true of Fukushima, though often the failures appear absurdly elementary. In the most quake-prone archipelago on earth, TEPCO and its regulators had no accident-management plan in the event of earthquakes and tsunamis--assuming, apparently, that the plant was proofed against them and that any hypothetical accidents would be generated only from within. TEPCO had, in the event of nuclear disaster, an off-site emergency headquarters just 5km from the plant that was not radiation-proof, and so was effectively useless. On site, the workers in its number one reactor appear not to have been familiar with an emergency-cooling system called an isolation condenser, which they wrongly thought was still working after the tsunami. Their supervisors made the same mistake, so a vital six hours were lost before other methods for cooling the overheating atomic fuel rods were deployed. Partly as a result, this was the first reactor to explode on March 12th. 
The government was almost as clueless. Naoto Kan, then prime minister, had a crisis headquarters on the fifth floor of the Kantei, his office building. But emergency staff from various ministries were relegated to the basement, and there was often miscommunication, not least because mobile phones did not work underground. Crucial data estimating the dispersion of radioactive matter were not given to the prime minister's office, so that evacuees like those from Namie were not given any advice on where to go. That is why they drove straight into the radioactive cloud. The report faults the government for providing information that was often bogus, ambiguous or slow. Perhaps the biggest failure was that nobody in a position of responsibility--neither TEPCO nor its regulators--had sought to look beyond the end of their noses in disaster planning. No one seems ever to have tried to ""think the unthinkable"". 
In America official reports such as those on the September 11th attacks or the Deepwater Horizon oil spill have become acclaimed books. This one is hardly a page-turner. A privately funded foundation, headed by Yoichi Funabashi, a former editor of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, is doing a separate investigation, based partly on the testimony of TEPCO whistle-blowers. (One, according to Mr Funabashi, says the earthquake damaged the reactors before the tsunami, a claim that officials have always rejected.) It at least promises to have literary merit. Mr Funabashi, a prominent author, draws parallels between the roots of the disaster and Japan's failures in the second world war. They include the use of heroic front-line troops with out-of-touch superiors; rotating decision-makers too often; narrow ""stovepipe"" thinking; and the failure to imagine that everything could go wrong at once. Complex systems, jerry-rigged 
For now, the risk is that the interim report does not get the attention it deserves. So far it seems to have aroused more interest on a techie website called Physics Forums, beloved of nuclear engineers, than in the Japanese press. The government, led by Yoshihiko Noda, has not yet used it as a rallying call for reform. One of its recommendations, an independent new regulatory body, will soon be set up. Others, such as new safety standards and broader evacuation plans, would take months to implement. 
Such reports are, after all, confidence-building exercises. They are meant to reassure the public that, by exposing failures, they will help to prevent them from being repeated. In the case of Fukushima Dai-ichi there is still plenty to be nervous about. Although the government declared on December 16th that the plant had reached a state of ""cold shutdown"", much of the cooling system is jerry-rigged and probably still not earthquake-proof. On January 1st a quake temporarily caused water levels to plunge in a pool containing highly radioactive spent-fuel rods. 
Meanwhile, across Japan, 48 out of 54 nuclear reactors remain out of service, almost all because of safety fears. Until somebody in power seizes on the report as a call to action, its findings, especially those that reveal sheer ineptitude, suggest that the public has every reason to remain as scared as hell.","A dangerous lack of urgency in drawing lessons from Japan 's nuclear disaster

ON MARCH 11th, the first anniversary of the day that turned her world upside down, 13-year-old Wakana Yokoyama will be performing a rice-planting dance for her fellow villagers. It will be a happy occasion, because she will be with old school friends she rarely sees any more. But it will be tinged with sadness, too; because although there are still villagers, there is no longer a village. 
On that bitterly cold day a year ago Ukedo (pictured above) took the full force of the tsunami. It killed about 180 of the village's 1,800 residents, including two of Wakana's grandparents. Some might have been saved, but when the first of three reactor buildings at the nearby Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant blew up, the authorities' focus shifted to evacuating the living rather than searching for survivors. Wakana, her family and thousands of others were ordered to drive to evacuation shelters which, although farther away, were directly in the path of the plant's plume of radioactivity. 
Wakana now lives in Koriyama, a city 60km west of Fukushima Dai-ichi. She attends a new school without any of her old classmates, and may go outside for only three hours a day because of lingering radiation. As time slips by, it is harder to stay in touch with others from Ukedo, where she grew up breathing the salt smell of the Pacific coast. But her eyes light up as she talks about the folk dances she performs, which are hundreds of years old. Keeping alive the traditions of a village she may never live in again is a strange responsibility for a child, but it is one she understands. 
The more edifying part of the story of Japan's response to the disasters of 3/11, as it is known, is one of individual burdens borne, of traditions reinvigorated and of communal self-reliance. It is not the whole story. A whopping {Yen}14.3 trillion ($175 billion) has been approved in four extra central-government budgets for recovery from a disaster that killed more than 19,000 people and made about 325,000 homeless. The government's Reconstruction Agency, which co-ordinates the way ministries spend money for rebuilding towns and villages, did not open its doors until February 10th, 11 months after the disaster. 
So those dislodged from their homes have been thrown back on their own resources. Their response is part of what Hakuhodo, one of Japan's two foremost advertising agencies, dubs ""Operation Me"": a growing embrace of autonomy in a country that has traditionally operated through a subtle form of groupthink, with challenges to authority well hidden. 
Thanks in large part to the spirit of self-help, a lot of the more obvious damage was cleared up quickly. Immediately after March 11th the tsunami-hit coastline looked like a Dali painting, strewn with the skeletons of buildings, crumpled vehicles and overturned ships; now there are neat roads and traffic lights. But the sunken roads are still liable to flood, and there are almost no houses or shops. The sheer expanse of the emptiness is shocking. 
Operation Us 
The public cannot fail to notice the contrast between official sluggishness and the emboldened efforts of people doing things for each other. For nuclear evacuees, government health checks have been sporadic--Wakana has undergone only one full-body scan, almost a year afterwards--but citizens' groups have increased their monitoring of nuclear evacuees for thyroid cancer and other problems. Charities have led the way in decontaminating radiation hotspots. An anti-nuclear network called the Citizens' Nuclear Information Centre has streamed Fukushima-related news conferences live on the internet since March 11th, bypassing the self-censoring filter of the mainstream media. 
In the tsunami-ravaged regions, volunteers have crowded back to the furusato, or home towns, their parents abandoned years ago. This has been vital in places like Rikuzentakata, a fishing port three hours' drive north of Fukushima, which was almost obliterated. It lost 2,200 people to the wave, about 10% of its population, including 100 municipal workers, about a third of the total payroll. It needs all the manpower it can get. Yet for all the solidarity, many of the volunteers, like the communities themselves, are disappointed with the results. 
One official at an aid organisation in the Rikuzentakata area says that the recovery has been plagued by tatewari, the ""stove-pipe"" thinking of the individual bureaucracies. For instance, in rescuing the fishing industry, the first dose of aid went via the fisheries ministry to the trawlermen; ice-makers, without whom the catch rots, fell under a different ministry and got nothing. ""Even after the disaster, the ministries put their own interests ahead of the victims,"" says the official. Without non-profit organisations, many victims of the disaster would have fallen through the gaps. ""The local NGOs are getting more and more power,"" says the official. ""This is self-sufficiency, since the government and ministries do not do much of the work."" 
And there is much work to do. The tsunami left an estimated 22.5m tonnes of debris scattered across Japan's north-east coast--the equivalent of possibly 20 years of municipal waste. Only 6% of it has been permanently disposed of (see map). Massive mountains of carefully sorted tyres, planks and other detritus rise like burial mounds along the coastline, lapped by a now gentle sea. Much of the farmland is contaminated with sea water; it will take several years for the salt to be washed out. In Rikuzentakata, as in many places, very little rebuilding has begun, other than rows of temporary houses that have commandeered school playing fields. The faint traces of concrete foundations in the earth are a poignant reminder of the town that has been lost. 
Disillusion with government is not just felt in the north-east. It spreads throughout Japan, and has origins that go much further back than last year. Something similar was at play when, in 2009, voters ended almost 55 years of uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and subsequently fell out of love with the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) that replaced it. But since March 11th the disillusion has grown a lot stronger. In an annual study released in January, Edelman, a public-relations firm, found that the Japanese people's trust in their national institutions, which had long been flat, had plummeted: it now hovers just above that seen in Vladimir Putin's Russia. The nuclear accident clobbered faith in government officials and power companies. Trust in the media also dived. Even municipal authorities are now openly distrustful of the central government. Three mayors of towns near the Fukushima plant boycotted a meeting with government ministers in February about burying radioactive soil. ""The government lies all the time,"" said one. 
Ask Yoshihiko Noda, the prime minister, about the breakdown of trust and he admits there is a perception that the government's response has been slow. He points to the temporary housing and numerous reconstruction budgets as evidence that the government has in fact ""rolled up its sleeves"". The ruling and opposition parties, he says, have worked ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" to help victims. 
Visit the stricken north-east, however, and a different story emerges. Political bickering in Tokyo delayed reconstruction efforts for at least three months, say local officials. For a while the LDP refused even to meet the prime minister in person, in effect obstructing relief efforts in the hope of forcing a snap election. The DPJ was rife with internal tensions that forced out the prime minister of the time, Naoto Kan. 
Mr Noda says, appealingly, that it is up to the local communities to decide how the reconstruction money is spent. But projects must fall into one of 40 predetermined categories; the funds are doled out in tranches over time; and the reconstruction agency's policy and guidance manuals run to more than 130 pages. Outdated rules persist. For instance, Rikuzentakata was unable to build a supermarket because of zoning laws aimed at protecting small shopkeepers. As many small shops were engulfed by the sea, coddling them is hardly a pressing matter. What counts is having somewhere to shop. Many rules thwart the recovery, says Futoshi Toba, the beleaguered mayor. 
Although people feel anger and frustration towards Tokyo, they know they still depend on it. They doubt their overstretched local authorities are up to the task, and want wise policymaking support from the central government of the sort that, for good or ill, used to be a hallmark of the Japanese state. There is a feeling that they are getting little attention, and that what they do get is from second-rate civil servants--the top brass being too self-important to leave Tokyo. 
As for the mainstream political parties, almost everyone in the affected areas sees them as part of the problem. Even now, Mr Noda's political priority has little to do with the tsunami: it is the consumption tax, which he wants to raise to prevent a financial meltdown. Once again, the spectre of parliamentary upheaval looms. If Mr Noda's government is forced to call a general election on the issue, as the opposition is demanding, progress in the north-east may once again grind to a halt. 
The fire last time 
As acute as these criticisms are, they pale beside the damage that the nuclear crisis has done to people's faith in authority. Mr Noda says, rather blithely, that ""everyone has to share the pain of responsibility"" for what happened at Fukushima. Indeed, much of society, excluding an anti-nuclear fringe, happily accepted the ""safety myth"" that enabled Japan to cram 54 nuclear reactors on one of the world's most earthquake-prone archipelagos. 
But if people bought the myth, it was because successive LDP governments, ministries, big-business lobbies, media barons and university professors sold it to them. Accidents such as Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 caused barely a flicker of hesitation over the building of more nuclear plants in Japan. For years, safety breaches were covered up and regulators looked the other way. They gave a virtual free hand to powerful regional monopolies like Tepco, the firm that operated Fukushima Dai-ichi. 
Within hours of the blackout that left that plant without the power to cool its reactors, it became clear that there was no comprehensive disaster-management plan. Mr Kan, the prime minister at the time, had to improvise, which often involved yelling at regulators and Tepco executives. Mistrust between the DPJ and Tepco, which had long supported the rival LDP, made matters worse. So did Mr Kan's despair at the civil servants around him, many of whom came from the elite University of Tokyo. Mr Kan, who attended the more practical Tokyo Institute of Technology, appears to have found them so unbearable that he appointed his own kitchen cabinet of crisis advisers, some of them friends from university days. 
One of those advisers, Hiroshi Tasaka, a former nuclear scientist who served Mr Kan from a few weeks after the disaster, says it was a matter of ""luck"" that things did not get far worse. A worst-case scenario suggested that parts of Tokyo itself might have had to be evacuated. At the darkest moment, after a third meltdown and a third hydrogen explosion, Tepco prepared to pull out its employees. Only a life-risking effort by 70 brave workers brought things back from the brink. 
Mr Tasaka fears lessons have not been learned. If there were another disaster tomorrow, the prime minister still could not call on specially trained experts or employ the full legal powers to cope with it, for example by ordering evacuations. A full review of how to reform regulatory structures is awaiting the conclusion of a string of investigative committees. Given the uncertainties, it is little wonder that 52 of the country's 54 nuclear reactors are now off-line--their power replaced by old thermal plants working at full capacity. 
Sounds of silence 
Possibly the most sensitive source of popular disquiet relates to information on radiation. This was partly held back to avoid causing panic. In some instances that may have been justified--though experts like Tatsuhiko Kodama, head of the Radioisotope Centre at the University of Tokyo, say there was no excuse for the bogus assurances that there was no risk to public health. ""What makes me most angry is the censorship,"" he says. 
The information that ministries had on the spread of radioactive fallout in the early days of the crisis was not shared with Mr Kan, nor, just as important, with the families of children like Wakana Yokoyama, who were evacuated to areas of even greater danger. Greenpeace, an environmental group, accuses the government of changing its standards on acceptable levels of radiation with no thought for the varying degrees of risk they pose to children and pregnant women. Hospitals were also evacuated, causing many doctors and nurses to leave the area--and therefore making it more difficult to conduct regular radiation checks on children. 
Disenchanted as they may be with all this, the Japanese have mostly avoided noisy expressions of protest, other than a spate of anti-nuclear demonstrations. But if Mr Noda calls a snap election over the consumption tax, voters may well start to cast around for alternatives to the DPJ and LDP. In the past year the outspoken pro-business mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, has caught national attention, and has launched a political party that might field candidates in an election. Mr Hashimoto's rise is not a direct reaction to the tsunami; his support is mostly in the west of the country. But if his party enters national politics, it is likely to cause upheaval. Some worry that his slick style could veer towards shallow populism. Voters may not much mind; he represents change. 
The culture of suspicion could have dire consequences. Japan's enormous debts are propped up by its citizens' willingness to buy government bonds. If they stop doing so, who else will? And if a lack of trust keeps the nuclear power plants shut down for lack of convincing regulatory reforms, industrial firms, already squeezed by a strong yen, may accelerate their move out of Japan. Elections or no, the political class needs to be much more serious about restoring the trust it has lost. 
In this it might learn from Japan's businesses, which--as the public has noted-- have weathered the crisis much better. Large manufacturers agreed to change their operating hours to balance their energy use, and sent teams of engineers to restore supply chains quickly. A government survey showed that there was almost no long-term loss of business from firms switching suppliers after the disruption. 
Toyota, the biggest car company, has tapped into the self-help mood by announcing plans to construct its own power plants at a newly built factory in the north-eastern region of Tohoku, which it will feed into the grid to help the local community in the event of power cuts. It is deeply worried about a stable supply of energy because of the closure of nuclear power plants. ""We call it self-defence,"" says Shinichi Sasaki, its executive vice-president. Aeon, Japan's largest supermarket chain, has set itself much tougher safety standards than the government's to ensure that food is radiation-free. It is conducting its own checks. 
With greater self-reliance may come a new vitality. One of the most pressing needs of the country is a revival of the entrepreneurial spirit that emerged after the second world war. If Japan is to phase out nuclear energy, it will need to pour copious human, intellectual and financial capital into new sources of power, while also breaking up the monopolies that dominate the industry today. A willingness to consider politicians from outside the mainstream may bring fresh air into Japan's stuffy politics. And any hints that people are prepared to challenge authority, however quietly, may press more of the elderly men who run Japanese companies to let a younger generation take charge. 
One sign of change is that a few prominent businessmen have bankrolled their own inquiry into the Fukushima disaster. Under their auspices a new think-tank, the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation, has gathered leading figures from media, business and technology and produced evidence of what went wrong. In a land where seniority reigns, Koichi Kitazawa, the panel's chairman, notes that the younger experts were able to solicit much better information than their elders. 
Change in Japan is usually visible only with hindsight. The mood, as one disenchanted civil servant puts it, recalls the moment before the end of the second world war when many Japanese soldiers and civilians realised the generals were leading their country to disaster, but dared not speak out. The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident have been the biggest shock to Japan since those dreadful days. But if the people find a voice, there may yet be hope of revival.
Caption: One year old, too","Last year 's triple disaster -- earthquake , tsunami and nuclear meltdown -- has shattered Japanese faith in many of the country 's institutions 
 ON MARCH 11th , the first anniversary of the day that turned her world upside down , 13 - year - old Wakana Yokoyama will be performing a rice - planting dance for her fellow villagers . It will be a happy occasion , because she will be with old school friends she rarely sees any more . But it will be tinged with sadness , too ; because although there are still villagers , there is no longer a village . 
 On that bitterly cold day a year ago Ukedo ( pictured above ) took the full force of the tsunami . It killed about 180 of the village 's 1,800 residents , including two of Wakana 's grandparents . Some might have been saved , but when the first of three reactor buildings at the nearby Fukushima Dai - ichi nuclear power plant blew up , the authorities ' focus shifted to evacuating the living rather than searching for survivors . Wakana , her family and thousands of others were ordered to drive to evacuation shelters which , although farther away , were directly in the path of the plant 's plume of radioactivity . 
 Wakana now lives in Koriyama , a city 60 km west of Fukushima Dai - ichi . She attends a new school without any of her old classmates , and may go outside for only three hours a day because of lingering radiation . As time slips by , it is harder to stay in touch with others from Ukedo , where she grew up breathing the salt smell of the Pacific coast . But her eyes light up as she talks about the folk dances she performs , which are hundreds of years old . Keeping alive the traditions of a village she may never live in again is a strange responsibility for a child , but it is one she understands . 
 The more edifying part of the story of Japan 's response to the disasters of 3/11 , as it is known , is one of individual burdens borne , of traditions reinvigorated and of communal self - reliance . It is not the whole story . A whopping { Yen}14.3 trillion ( $ 175 billion ) has been approved in four extra central - government budgets for recovery from a disaster that killed more than 19,000 people and made about 325,000 homeless . The government 's Reconstruction Agency , which co - ordinates the way ministries spend money for rebuilding towns and villages , did not open its doors until February 10th , 11 months after the disaster . 
 So those dislodged from their homes have been thrown back on their own resources . Their response is part of what Hakuhodo , one of Japan 's two foremost advertising agencies , dubs "" Operation Me "" : a growing embrace of autonomy in a country that has traditionally operated through a subtle form of groupthink , with challenges to authority well hidden . 
 Thanks in large part to the spirit of self - help , a lot of the more obvious damage was cleared up quickly . Immediately after March 11th the tsunami - hit coastline looked like a Dali painting , strewn with the skeletons of buildings , crumpled vehicles and overturned ships ; now there are neat roads and traffic lights . But the sunken roads are still liable to flood , and there are almost no houses or shops . The sheer expanse of the emptiness is shocking . 
 Operation Us 
 The public can not fail to notice the contrast between official sluggishness and the emboldened efforts of people doing things for each other . For nuclear evacuees , government health checks have been sporadic -- Wakana has undergone only one full - body scan , almost a year afterwards -- but citizens ' groups have increased their monitoring of nuclear evacuees for thyroid cancer and other problems . Charities have led the way in decontaminating radiation hotspots . An anti - nuclear network called the Citizens ' Nuclear Information Centre has streamed Fukushima - related news conferences live on the internet since March 11th , bypassing the self - censoring filter of the mainstream media . 
 In the tsunami - ravaged regions , volunteers have crowded back to the furusato , or home towns , their parents abandoned years ago . This has been vital in places like Rikuzentakata , a fishing port three hours ' drive north of Fukushima , which was almost obliterated . It lost 2,200 people to the wave , about 10 % of its population , including 100 municipal workers , about a third of the total payroll . It needs all the manpower it can get . Yet for all the solidarity , many of the volunteers , like the communities themselves , are disappointed with the results . 
 One official at an aid organisation in the Rikuzentakata area says that the recovery has been plagued by tatewari , the "" stove - pipe "" thinking of the individual bureaucracies . For instance , in rescuing the fishing industry , the first dose of aid went via the fisheries ministry to the trawlermen ; ice - makers , without whom the catch rots , fell under a different ministry and got nothing . "" Even after the disaster , the ministries put their own interests ahead of the victims , "" says the official . Without non - profit organisations , many victims of the disaster would have fallen through the gaps . "" The local NGOs are getting more and more power , "" says the official .

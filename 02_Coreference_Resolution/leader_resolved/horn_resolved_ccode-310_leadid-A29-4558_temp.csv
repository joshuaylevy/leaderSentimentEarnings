So some 500 delegates from this and that Islamic movement--plus a handful of secular politicians--gathered last week in Friendship Hall, a concrete monster in Khartoum built by the Chinese, for the second session of the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference. Set up by the Sudanese, with Yemeni help, after the Gulf war, this body's proclaimed aim is to prevent ""the splits among Arab and Muslim governments from extending to Muslim peoples.""
Hassan al-Turabi, Sudan's Islamic power behind the generals, believes the day will come when secular governments--even America's, which recently put Sudan on the list of countries that it believes sponsor terrorism--will have to open talks with the militant ideologues of the Muslim world. And Mr Turabi wants to make sure that he will be the channel of negotiation. So he was careful in Khartoum to carry an air (not the one for which he or Sudan's military men are best known) of moderation.
His guests included some of the most militant of the militants: the Palestinians' Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Lebanon's Hizbullah, ""Afghanis"" (veterans of the Afghan war) from Algeria. But, encouraged by the fact that Algeria's National Liberation Front too was there, Mr Turabi boasted of plans to embark on a mediation effort in Algeria.
His ambition to mediate between Palestinian factions came to nothing. Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of one Syrian-backed (and secular) rejectionist guerrilla group, turned up; Yasser Arafat did not. Reject ionist voices called for ""the liberation of all Palestine"" but, under Mr Turabi's guidance, the conference did not even formally condemn the Israeli-Palestinian accord. It merely rejected it.
Mr Turabi was also markedly careful not to alarm the Egyptian government, which entertains lively suspicions of what its southern neighbours are up to. The Muslim Brethren were there, but not the radical Jamaat Islamiya. ""We only invited those allowed to move about in their own country,"" explained Mr Turabi, and the conference said nothing nasty about Egypt.
Sudan's ambitions to emerge as the rallying-point for Islamists got a cold response from Saudi Arabia, which, claimed Mr Turabi, ""prevented its citizens from attending the conference."" The Arab Gulf states all boycotted the affair. With Iran, Sudan might be prepared to do a geographical deal. Iran, the cradle of Shia Muslim militancy, looks to extend its influence in the Gulf area and in Central Asia; Sudan is mainly interested in Africa, in particular the Horn of Africa. And it is not militancy it is exporting, says Mr Turabi, but ""a modern Islam...an alternative model of life.""

Sudan has been at war with itself for the bulk of the time since it became independent in 1956. This past decade has been the most destructive, claiming 1m lives and uprooting perhaps 3m southerners--roughly half the southern population--from their homes. Piece by piece, an entire civilisation is being dismantled.
The war, which sets the Arab, Muslim north against the black, animist and Christian south--and the southerners against each other--is raging again. Recent peace talks, set up by neighbours in the Horn of Africa, failed. Now the Islamic regime in Khartoum appears to have launched its long-expected dry-season offensive. There are reports of the army fanning out from Juba and Yei, trying to capture the remaining rebel-held towns and to cut the supply lines from Uganda. Refugees are once more swarming towards the Ugandan border.
The renewed fighting comes on top of a drought that has ravaged broad areas of the south, putting at least 1.5m people at risk from starvation. Aid workers fear that unless food arrives quickly they will confront the worst Sudanese famine since 1988, when up to 300,000 people died. But none of the warring factions puts human suffering high among its priorities. At recent talks with the United Nations in Nairobi, the belligerents could not agree on measures that would allow emergency food supplies to be trucked into hard-hit Western and Eastern Equatoria. Their main concern? That their military positions should not be compromised.

As the archbishop of Canterbury put it after a recent visit to southern Sudan, ""The people of the south are fed up with their defenders fighting one another.""
The government, unable to secure a conventional military victory, has chosen a war of attrition. It has worked well. Aerial bombing and ground campaigns by government forces, coinciding with murderous inter-tribal fighting among the southerners, have emptied scores of towns and villages. Some 2m southerners have fled north; more than 600,000 are displaced in the south, and another 400,000 in refugee camps in Uganda, Zaire, Kenya, Ethiopia and the Central African Republic.
This displacement of people, and the continyous insecurity over wide areas, have left few social structures intact. Hopes for durable systems of education, health or basic economic development have been shot to pieces. In Akot a gaping bomb crater disfigures a neat cluster of white cottages, once southern Sudan's only institute for primary health training. The institute opened in 1981, only to be closed a year or so later by the war.

But shortage of scrap metal shackles the regular production even of these small items. The collapse of trade routs means that essentials--from sugar, soap and salt to fishhooks and clothes--are scarce.
Tribal ways--most of the people concerned are Dinkas--are affected. As cattle herds dwindle, a bride who might once have cost 200 cows may now be handed over by her father for just ten.

Right from him the start he seized what lay around fashion into tools with which to hack, carve, pound and sew his way through life. But as he shaped the wood, horn, stone and iron that nature had provided, he had little understanding of why each had particular strengths and weaknesses. Nor did he need it. It is only when you make materials from scratch that knowing why things are as they are begins to matter; before that, trial and error will suffice.
The array of materials around today shows that trial and error has done pretty well. But scientists, of course, are not satisfied with it. They want to know why. In the past century they have developed a wide field of material science that seeks to answer the question, explaining what arrangements of matter at a microscopic level give rise to the properties of everyday substances. This knowledge has its practical side. When corporate research directors gathered at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena on February 3rd to hear about its work in material science, it was not just the knowledge that drew them; it was the fact that the researchers presenting it can use that knowledge to build new properties into matter.
One of the materials they have been working on is glass. Glass is extremely hard and can be shaped fairly easily, encouraging scientists to look for ways to use its strength while eliminating, or getting ground, its tendency to shatter. The usual way to toughen lass, developed in the 1920s, is to draw it into fibres that can reinforce other materials. A different approach was on display at Caltech in the form of a handful of shiny lozenges cooked up in the material-science laboratories by William Johnson and Atakan Peker. They were glasses, but were made of metal. This metallic lass provides a combination of strength and flexibility nothing else can match.
The fact that these grey lozenges are called lass demonstrates the differences between the way normal people and scientists think about materials. To most people a material is a mixture of properties and substance; glass is transparent and made of sand. To scientists, materials are characterised by their microscopic structure; glasses are solids with no internal order to the arrangement of their atoms.
In this they are more like liquids than other solids, such as specks of sand or ingots of metal, which are crystalline. The atoms in crystals form a regular pattern that is repeated all the way through; one little bit will look like any other one, far away. Glass is made when a liquid cools so quickly that its molecules, which can jiggle around freely in the molten state, do not et a chance to make such orderly lines. Instead, they screech to a halt wherever they happen to be: the liquid's randomness is ""frozen"". The freezing is not complete. Look at a really old window and you can see the effects of the lass's slow, sagging flow.
Old-fashioned glass is easy to make from the silicate crystals in sand; once they melt, it is hard for the silica to do anything except cool into a glass. Making crystalline forms, such as quartz and chrysolite, requires slow cooling under tremendous pressure. But metals are just the opposite. Metal atoms are extremely amenable to being ordered, so metals tend to crystallize quickly and easily. To get them to keep their liquid disorder in a solid takes real skill. The first vitreous metals had to be made by ""superquenching"" small droplets in a cold bath that cooled them at a rate equivalent to 1mdegC in a second. With the energy sucked out this quickly, even metals will not crystallize.
That was done in the 1950s. It was not until 1990 that a Japanese research group found how to make metallic glass that could be cooled much more gently. The secret was in the mix; alloys of zirconium and lanthanum spiked with aluminum, nickel and copper. The atoms in these mixtures differ widely in size, which thwarts their urge to pack themselves into a regularly configured crystal. Following the Japanese lead, Dr Johnson and Mr Peker have produced samples of a zirconium, titanium, copper, nickel and beryllium alloy that forms glass when cooled at less than 10degC a second. The advantage of slow cooling is that you can make lumps of metal, rather than specks.
The material this produces is twice as strong and half as dense as the best steel. It is hard, resistant to wear and corrosion, and smooth--it slides across a surface as if it were Teflon. It is also ductile: a strip of the glass can be rolled into a ribbon a hundred times thinner without cracking. And because the molecular structure is not locked rigidly, the glass does not have a fixed melting point, but gradually softens like toffee as it warms up, making it easy to mould into useful shapes that set when the glass is cooled again. Dr Johnson and Mr Peker are keeping mum about who they are talking to, but acknowledge that there is already commercial interest, and that the material could be used to make everything from springy golf clubs to stamping dies. In Japan, Honda and Toyota are both sponsoring research into metallic glass for cars.
The Japanese team that did the 1990 work is now investigating a further refinement of the technology, using an aluminum-based alloy that incorporates both glassy and crystalline forms to achieve the strength of steel at a much lower weight. By carefully regulating the recipe and controlling the cooling, they create a kind of composite, in which tiny crystals of aluminum a few billionths of a metre across start to form in a predominantly glassy mass. The crystals occupy about a quarter of the whole volume, and bind it internally like straw in clay bricks. It is glass that rows its own internal fibres.
Ductile materials are attractive to manufacturers because of the ease with which a mould can shape them to their final form. Mark Davis, of Caltech's chemical-engineering department, is also in the shape-imprinting game; but he does it at the microscopic level.
Zeolites are porous minerals made of aluminum and silicon. Industry likes them because they act as chemical sieves. Their pores allow only molecules below a certain size to pass through, which means they can be used to filter things out of gases or liquids. They are also used to soften water, by absorbing into their pores the ions that make water hard. Dr Davis's technique allows him to control the size of the sieve's mesh. He finds an organic molecule of the right size and grows a zeolite crystal with this molecule in suspension. The zeolite rows with its porous spaces filled by the organic molecule. When it is finished the organic material is burnt away, to leave a bespoke silicate skeleton.
Dr Davis can control the zeolites because he knows their structure; the more he controls it, the greater his understanding of this structure rows. With today's tools, finding out how something works at microscopic level almost necessarily means learning how to make it work differently. Trial and error is still around, if at a smaller scale; its impact could be bigger than ever.","MAN was ever a materialist.

Or, more accurately, rider. Although he was champion of Piedmont a few years back, Mr Sanna now holds only an A4 licence, that of a cicloamatore--not far above somebody who likes to get out on a Sunday on his bicycle and roll along back roads, admiring the scenery and perhaps pausing to catch his breath once he has made it to the top of a long hill.
Not the sort of person, in short, to attack the most revered record in the sport: the hour's ride against the clock, around and around a track, alone. The names that do spring to mind there are those of giants of the sport: Henri Desgrane, the father of the Tour de France, who first set the record of 35.325 km/h (21.95 mph) in 1893; Lucien Petit Breton, who reached 41.110 km/h in 1905; Oscar Egg, 43.525 km/h in 1913 and 44.247 km/h the next year; Fausto Coppi, 45.848 km/h in 1942; Jacques Anquetil, 46.159 km/h in 1956; Ole Ritter, 48.653 km/h in 1968, and Eddy Mercku, 49.431 km/h in 1972.
There the record stayed, just below the magically round 50 km/h, for a dozen years. An aura began to surround 50 km/h: if Mr Merckx, the greatest racer in the history of the sport, had been unable to reach it, what chance did others have? What the four-minute mile had been for running, 50km/h became for cycling.
Then, in 1984, Francesco Moser of Italy travelled to Mexico city with a new method of training, centred on strict monitoring of the heartbeat to increase endurance past the point where lactic acid builds up in oxygen-depleted muscles and overwhelms the rider in pain. Mr Moser also had a plastic strip that was glued to the track to reduce friction. Finally, he had a new bicycle wheel, the now-familiar disc, which uses a plastic covering over the spokes to reduce drag against the wind. With the wheel, the scientific training, the plastic track strip and the power that helped him win the gruelling Paris-Roubaix race three times, Mr Moser was able to cover 50.808 kilometres in an hour on January 19th 1984. Four days later he covered 51.151 kilometres.
When he heard the news in his native Belgium, Mr Merckx was outraged. Mr Moser, he charged, had no right to challenge the record with anything but the standard bike that Mr Merckx had used a dozen years before; if disc wheels were to be used, let Mr Moser's record forever bear an asterisk.
The world of bicycle racing broke into guffaws. If equipment should be standardised for attempts on the hour record, all agreed, why had not Mr Merckx ridden the same bicycle, solid rubber tires, up-right position and all, that Desgrange used in 1893? Since Mr Moser set his record other new equipment had sped the racer along: tapered helmets to reduce drag, clipless pedals to transfer power better from the legs, titanium to slim a bicycle's weight, extended aerobars to tighten the rider's tuck (ie, position).
Mr Moser's record stood until last year, when Graeme Obree, an unemployed rider from Scotland, took the chase to a higher plane. Using parts from the family washing machine, he built a bicycle with a narrow, straight handlebar and short bar ends rather than aerobars or the traditional downward curving, bull's horn model. To ride, Mr Obree grips the bar ends, leans far forward and rests his shoulders on the back of his hands. The nearly flat back is now described as ""the egg position"".
Jutting far over the handlebars and pushing a monstrously huge gear that propelled him 9.25 metres with each turn of the pedals, Mr Obree went to a track in Hamar, Norway, last July and broke Mr Moser's record by 445 metres. Six days later, on a track in Bordeaux, Chris Boardman, an Englishman, broke Mr Obree's record by 674 metres.
Riding a carbon-fibre bicycle, Mr Boardman adopted an aerodynamic position with the help of handlebars which extend like a prow--a design nowhere near as odd as Mr Obree's egg. Mr Boardman played down the significance of his equipment. In fact, he said, he had been spurred on by the people who claimed that his victory in the pursuit race at the Barcelona Olympics was due entirely to his revolutionary Lotus bicycle. This time he rode an Ultima bicycle, partly for commercial reasons and partly to prove that legs, not bicycles, win races.
That is almost certainly true. Mr Obree's piece of scrap, which he values at about $100 for the material, is obviously far less important to his record than his unique position.
Unique?
In January, Mr Moser flew to the velodrome in Mexico city where he set his record. He is nearly 43 years old and had retired from competition in 1988 but still rides often and for long hours, and so is fit. He was also accompanied by the same doctors who attended him in 1984 and he carried in his baggage a high-tech version of the Obree bicycle. Even better, he had adapted Mr Obree's egg position.
Although he said he was simply aiming for a personal best, Mr Moser fooled nobody. He was hoping to regain the record. In the egg position he came close: pushing a gear that propelled him 8.74 metres with every turn, the Italian covered 51.840 kilometres to surpass Mr Obree's record by 244 metres and fall just 430 metres short of Mr Boardman's. It was the second-longest hour record in history and 689 metres farther than he had gone a decade before.
Mr Moser has tried four times since to outdo himself and Mr Boardman. His first attempt was his best. Now, he says, he has retired again from the chase after the hour record. And what about the unknown Mr Sanna, the Italian 25-year-old who went to Mexico as a member of Mr Moser's entourage and a training partner? A day before Mr Moser attacked the record, Mr Sanna used a prototype bicycle and the Obree position to win himself around the track for a distance of 50.205km. That was only the eighth best on record but, for not much more than a Sunday cyclist, it seemed to be glorious.","The tifosi, as Italian sports fans are called, may be the most enthusiastic in the solar system about cycling, but until January few of them had ever heard of Vanni Sanna, a 25-year-old racer. Or, more accurately, rider. Although he was champion of Piedmont a few years back, Mr Sanna now holds only an A4 licence, that of a cicloamatore--not far above somebody who likes to get out on a Sunday on his bicycle and roll along back roads, admiring the scenery and perhaps pausing to catch his breath once he has made it to the top of a long hill.
Not the sort of person, in short, to attack the most revered record in the sport: the hour's ride against the clock, around and around a track, alone. The names that do spring to mind there are those of giants of the sport: Henri Desgrane, the father of the Tour de France, who first set the record of 35.325 km/h (21.95 mph) in 1893; Lucien Petit Breton, who reached 41.110 km/h in 1905; Oscar Egg, 43.525 km/h in 1913 and 44.247 km/h the next year; Fausto Coppi, 45.848 km/h in 1942; Jacques Anquetil, 46.159 km/h in 1956; Ole Ritter, 48.653 km/h in 1968, and Eddy Mercku, 49.431 km/h in 1972.
There the record stayed, just below the magically round 50 km/h, for a dozen years. An aura began to surround 50 km/h: if Mr Merckx, the greatest racer in the history of the sport, had been unable to reach it, what chance did others have? What the four-minute mile had been for running, 50km/h became for cycling.
Then, in 1984, Francesco Moser of Italy travelled to Mexico city with a new method of training, centred on strict monitoring of the heartbeat to increase endurance past the point where lactic acid builds up in oxygen-depleted muscles and overwhelms the rider in pain. Mr Moser also had a plastic strip that was glued to the track to reduce friction. Finally, he had a new bicycle wheel, the now-familiar disc, which uses a plastic covering over the spokes to reduce drag against the wind. With the wheel, the scientific training, the plastic track strip and the power that helped him win the gruelling Paris-Roubaix race three times, Mr Moser was able to cover 50.808 kilometres in an hour on January 19th 1984. Four days later he covered 51.151 kilometres.
When he heard the news in his native Belgium, Mr Merckx was outraged. Mr Moser, he charged, had no right to challenge the record with anything but the standard bike that Mr Merckx had used a dozen years before; if disc wheels were to be used, let Mr Moser's record forever bear an asterisk.
The world of bicycle racing broke into guffaws. If equipment should be standardised for attempts on the hour record, all agreed, why had not Mr Merckx ridden the same bicycle, solid rubber tires, up-right position and all, that Desgrange used in 1893? Since Mr Moser set his record other new equipment had sped the racer along: tapered helmets to reduce drag, clipless pedals to transfer power better from the legs, titanium to slim a bicycle's weight, extended aerobars to tighten the rider's tuck (ie, position).
Mr Moser's record stood until last year, when Graeme Obree, an unemployed rider from Scotland, took the chase to a higher plane. Using parts from the family washing machine, he built a bicycle with a narrow, straight handlebar and short bar ends rather than aerobars or the traditional downward curving, bull's horn model. To ride, Mr Obree grips the bar ends, leans far forward and rests his shoulders on the back of his hands. The nearly flat back is now described as ""the egg position"".
Jutting far over the handlebars and pushing a monstrously huge gear that propelled him 9.25 metres with each turn of the pedals, Mr Obree went to a track in Hamar, Norway, last July and broke Mr Moser's record by 445 metres. Six days later, on a track in Bordeaux, Chris Boardman, an Englishman, broke Mr Obree's record by 674 metres.
Riding a carbon-fibre bicycle, Mr Boardman adopted an aerodynamic position with the help of handlebars which extend like a prow--a design nowhere near as odd as Mr Obree's egg. Mr Boardman played down the significance of his equipment. In fact, he said, he had been spurred on by the people who claimed that his victory in the pursuit race at the Barcelona Olympics was due entirely to his revolutionary Lotus bicycle. This time he rode an Ultima bicycle, partly for commercial reasons and partly to prove that legs, not bicycles, win races.

Occasionally the animals lift their heads, displaying their proud horns, and look through nearsighted eyes at the rolling countryside. There is just one oddity: standing close to the rhinos are three men with automatic rifles--not poachers, but part of a team giving 24-hour protection.
Rhinos were once plentiful among Africa's big game. Their armoured skin and cantankerous nature meant they had no effective predator, and their food was plentiful. Man has undone that. Their stamping grounds have shrunk, and the trade in rhino horn, prized in Yemen for dagger handles and in Asia as a medicine and aphrodisiac, has savaged their numbers.
Zimbabwe was the last stronghold of the black rhino. In the early 1980s it still had a thriving population of some 3,000 wild rhinos. Today it has fewer than 100. The Zambezi River valley, which once held nearly 2,000 of the beasts, was especially vulnerable to poachers coming in from Zambia. There may be a handful left there, but traders cannot find them.
Now Zimbabwe is fostering tiny pockets of rhinos in game parks, private conservancies and on game ranches. But even those few are under attack. Two years ago Zimbabwe's parks department cut off the horns of its remaining rhinos, in the hope that poachers would ignore them. It worked for a while, but then frustrated rhino-hunters began killing them too.
Fumbi, a six-year-old female adopted a year ago by the The Economist, is one of seven rhinos at Imire game ranch, east of Harare. Norman Travers, Imire's owner, has trained six elephants to carry the armed guards and follow the rhinos wherever they roam over his 7,000 acres. In the evening they are enticed into a boma, a corral, with milk and fresh grass. Two rhinos at a private ranch in northern Zimbabwe were recently killed in their fenced-in boma, so Mr Travers has thrown up a bunker of sandbags around Fumbi's and is erecting an electrified security fence.
He spends about Z$180,000 ($22,500) a year on his rhinos. Not for fun. Imire also boasts giraffes, sable antelopes, zebras, hippos and other wildlife. About 50 paying guests visit Imire each week. The ranch also has 4,000 acres of tobacco and maize and employs more than 30 people. The Zimbabwean government is compulsorily buying up large farms for redistribution. Mr Travers hopes his game ranch will be spared.","Ambling through the Zimbabwean bush, using their nimble lips to pluck off leaves and young branches, the herd of seven rhinos seems not to have a care in the world.

Ten years after the great Ethiopian famine shocked the world, the first grim harbingers of what could become a still worse disaster, if the world closes its eyes, are stalking the countryside. Starvation deaths are being recorded. Figures of severe malnutrition among children have shot up. Precious oxen are being sold for bags of grain. Families are starting to migrate.
Although a few teasing spring showers have brightened the Abyssinian hills with a deceptive wash of green, the sad reality is that, yet again, the rains are far too little and too late. Another hungry season has begun.
Ethiopia is only one of six countries in the Horn of Africa where the rains have failed over the past year, requiring a massive infusion of emergency food rations. According to America's Agency for International Development (USAID), more than 17m people in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia, Djibouti and Kenya, two-thirds of them victims of drought, are ""at risk"" of starvation.
Few face a grimmer prospect than in Ethiopia and its former province Eritrea; independent since a year ago. The end in 1991 of three decades of civil war raised hopes that their people might at last be able to lift themselves from an endless cycle of food shortage. It was not to be, not yet at least.
Eritrea's new government did everything right. Seeds, oxen and ploughs were distributed; trees were planted, dams and terraces built; the area under cultivation was expanded by 25%. The rains arrived in 1993, but too late, too light or, occasionally, too heavy. Then came locusts, grasshoppers and rats. Crop failure was estimated at 80%, and it was back to food aid for some two-thirds of Eritrea's 2.5m population.
At least 7m of their Ethiopian cousins will need food hand-outs to survive this year. Feeding centres have been set up in the hard-hit Tiray and Omo regions, where marasmus (severe wasting) and kwashiorkor (severe protein deficiency) are again shrivelling the limbs and swelling the bellies of small children. Many farmers are beginning to feed cactus to their hungry cattle, a last resort not seen in Tiray since 1984-85. Desperate families are beginning to eat the seeds they should be planting.
Food shipments have been slow in arriving, and Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission says ""days of despair"" lie ahead if the ships do not come soon. Ethiopia had hoped to use aid money for development rather than emergency relief. In an unusually blunt admission of frustration, Simone Michale, head of the commission, has told donors: ""To many, Ethiopia seems to be an infertile desert populated by millions of beggars...a bottomless pit into which billions of dollars of aid have been poured to no visible effect. Even to us Ethiopians, sometimes we seem to be running just to keep still.""
The good news, donors say, is that the Ethiopian government has been quick and open in admitting its need. It is, says a senior western aid official, ""a caring, co-operative partner"". That is a far cry from 1984-85, when the dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam did all it could to cover up the famine until hundreds of thousands had died.
Yet even with a government that has opened up market systems and brought peace, and even when rains are bountiful, Ethiopia must import food, around 1m tonnes a year. In 1985, when the famine was at its height and thousands were dying each day, 1.3m tonnes were needed to feed 8m people at risk of starvation. Today comparable figures are used when aid workers talk merely of a ""crisis in the making"".
Population growth could make the trouble far worse than it was ten years ago. Between them, Ethiopia and Eritrea had 42m people then. They have 55m today. If this summer's long rains fail, the two will need 3m-4m tonnes of food aid; even a 10% reduction in the (once) normal rainfall could mean 2m tonnes were needed. ""That scares the hell out of me,"" admits an American aid official with long experience in the region. ""How could we mobilise that much? And if we could, how would we move it out?""
Ethiopia's neighbours are faring better--but not much. In Sudan, where civil war is the chief culprit, close to 5m people are deemed at risk. In the south and the Nuba mountains where displacement has become a way of life, 3-1/2m have fled their homes and need help; repeated efforts to arrange a truce that would allow food and medical aid to be ferried across the war zone have come to nothing. In the rest of the country, two wretched rainy seasons have bedevilled those lucky enough to farm in peace. The price of sorghum is soaring, and food shortages are forcing farming families from their homes. At El Obeid in northern Kordofan, a centre for famine relief in the past, dozens of hungry people are arriving each day. They could become hundreds.
Somalia, where at least 750,000 people depend on food aid, has been hit by renewed banditry since most western troops withdrew from the UN peacekeeping force in March. There is plenty of food; the difficulty, as in 1992, when hundreds of thousands of Somalis starved, is in brining it to those in need. That is getting harder. The World Food Programme has pulled staff out of the explosive port of Kismayu and reports increasing troubles moving food.
Even in Kenya, relatively developed and well-off, 3m people or more are at risk, says USAID. Pastoralists have lost hundreds of thousands of their livestock, as water sources and pasture have dried to dust.
For how much longer will the world have to feed the Horn? Ethiopia's Mr Michale urges donors to view this year's food aid not as ""the walking-stick of perennial aid, but as a crutch to help us until we can walk on our own feet."" No one disagrees. The cure could be long, though, and involve many different treatments. One much-needed part of it has nothing to do with either farming or population control: around 6m of those in the region who depend on food aid are refugees from civil war.","It is starting again.

In the south and the Nuba mountains where displacement has become a way of life, 3-1/2m have fled their homes and need help; repeated efforts to arrange a truce that would allow food and medical aid to be ferried across the war zone have come to nothing. In the rest of the country, two wretched rainy seasons have bedevilled those lucky enough to farm in peace. The price of sorghum is soaring, and food shortages are forcing farming families from their homes. At El Obeid in northern Kordofan, a centre for famine relief in the past, dozens of hungry people are arriving each day. They could become hundreds.
Somalia, where at least 750,000 people depend on food aid, has been hit by renewed banditry since most western troops withdrew from the UN peacekeeping force in March. There is plenty of food; the difficulty, as in 1992, when hundreds of thousands of Somalis starved, is in brining it to those in need. That is getting harder. The World Food Programme has pulled staff out of the explosive port of Kismayu and reports increasing troubles moving food.
Even in Kenya, relatively developed and well-off, 3m people or more are at risk, says USAID. Pastoralists have lost hundreds of thousands of their livestock, as water sources and pasture have dried to dust.
For how much longer will the world have to feed the Horn? Ethiopia's Mr Michale urges donors to view this year's food aid not as ""the walking-stick of perennial aid, but as a crutch to help us until we can walk on our own feet."" No one disagrees. The cure could be long, though, and involve many different treatments. One much-needed part of it has nothing to do with either farming or population control: around 6m of those in the region who depend on food aid are refugees from civil war.",310,Hungary,A29-4558,,False,,0,True

In the first round of parliamentary elections on May 8th, the country's voters are preparing to follow slavishly the regional trend. The left, fresh from electoral success in Poland and Lithuania, is poised for a comeback at the polls in Hungary too. In the three latest opinion polls, the Hungarian Socialist Party, successor to the communist party that monopolised power for 40 years, has surged from 11% of the vote in 1990 to an average of 34%.
This course of events was not in the script. Hungary's was supposed to be the model transition. Experiments with economic reforms started as far back as 1968; private enterprise began to burgeon in the early 1980s; and Hungary started this decade with the strongest middle class in Eastern Europe. The 1990 elections produced a solid conservative majority around the Hungarian Democratic Forum and, as an alternative government, a liberal opposition around the Alliance of Free Democrats. The Socialists were marginalised. The Forum coalition has established for Hungary a reputation as an island of stability in Eastern Europe and for itself the title of Eastern Europe's most enduring government.
While Poland's democrats pursued shock therapy, the Forum opted for a policy of gradualism to cushion the pain of economic transition. Foreign investment flowed in: $7 billion of it since 1990, more than in all the rest of Eastern Europe put together. Privatisation, in stops and starts, has proceeded to the point where 60% of Hungary's GDP (counting the black economy) is produced by the private sector.
So what has one awry? The Forum, for a start, has had trouble turning itself into a modern conservative force. The party lost its claim to the political centre by first appeasing and then laboriously expelling the far-right members who admired Istvan Csurka, a writer with extreme nationalist views. The non-communist opposition has performed almost as badly. The Free Democrats tore themselves apart in factional warfare before pulling together for the elections. The neoliberal instincts of the party's intellectuals have inhibited a move to the more promising electoral rounds of social democracy and abandoned the left of the political spectrum to the Socialists.
Neither Hungary's early start with reforms, nor relatively rapid foreign investment and privatisation, have been enough to protect the country from recession. Even without a deliberate policy of shock therapy, Hungary's economy has still suffered plenty of jolts. The collapse of trade, first with the other ex-Soviet satellites, then with the ex-Soviet Union itself, was the main factor behind a 20% drop in Hungarian GDP between 1989 and 1993.
True, the official figures overstate the depression, and central Budapest certainly looks prosperous. But the new wealth is concentrated in few hands. Gabor Varszegi, the chief executive of Fotex, an up-market retail group, says his customers are from a ""high society"" that makes up a tenth of the population but controls half the purchasing power. This new elite, fond of glinting sunglasses and mobile telephones, impresses foreign visitors but makes ordinary Hungarians more aware that they are still poor.
As for the former communists, their bloody but increasingly distant history has not proved much of a handicap. Gyula Horn, the 61-year-old Socialist leader, was born early enough to have joined the despised ""padded jackets"": the volunteer militia that helped put down Hungary's 1956 uprising against communist rule. But voters generally prefer to think of him as the reformist foreign minister who in 1989 helped lift the iron curtain between East and West. They associate his party less with the horrors of the 1950s and more with the easy-going days of ""goulash communism"".
Memories of that period, more attractive with the passing of time, has made the current recession all the harder to bear and voters all the more disgruntled. Only 18% of Hungarians surveyed recently said they were better off than before, fewer than in any other East European country bar Russia.

These are the six worthy goals under which American foreign aid is supposed to be distributed in the Clinton era. It sounds quite new. It is not. The $13.7 billion in foreign aid approved on July 15th by the Senate will go to roughly the same places as usual. Only the rubric has changed.
In November 1993, the Clinton administration announced that it would completely revise foreign aid. Instead of the old cold-war system, when foreign aid was used to reward client states and allies, Mr Clinton's new policy would direct the money towards objectives, not recipients. On top of that, the Agency for International Development (AID)--the government agency that manages foreign aid--has started to worry about the environment and overpopulation. Its new head, Brian Atwood, is trying to practise preventive diplomacy and to trim the agency's bureaucracy. AID has simultaneously cut 21 missions overseas and focused on averting famine in the Horn of Africa.
That is about as far as the change goes. The Senate bill is full of ""earmarks""--specifications that money must go to certain countries or particular causes. Once those earmarks are factored in, the American aid package does not look so different.
America still uses foreign aid to sweeten an Arab-Israeli peace. Israel and Egypt continue to get about $5 billion each year between them as a reward for their 1979 peace treaty. Add to that about $80m for the Palestinians, and possibly some debt-forgiveness for Jordan if King Hussein's meeting next week with Yitzhak Rabin goes well. In all, the Middle East claims around 40% of the foreign-aid budget.
In contrast, aid to the wreck of the Soviet Union is less of a priority. Russia and the other new republics got $2.5 billion last year; this year the Senate has asked for only $839m (less than the $900m Mr Clinton requested). Of that, $150m is earmarked for Ukraine, $50m for Georgia and $75m for Armenia. So $300m-400m may actually wind up in Russia itself. And that will be given out only if Russia is out of the Baltics by August 31st--a Republican provision. For that snub, Russia must settle for about one-sixth of Egypt's share.
As usual, a good $3.2 billion will go to ""promoting peace""--that is, military assistance. Only five countries will get such aid: Israel ($1.8 billion), Egypt ($1.3 billion), Jordan ($7m), Greece and Turkey (loans of $24m and $35m respectively). Arms sales, which are closely related to foreign aid, have doubled under Mr Clinton, to a record high of $33 billion last year. About 40% of that total went to Saudi Arabia and about 20% to Taiwan, both the result of big sales approved by Mr Bush in the heat of the election campaign.
One potential goal for a new American policy has been ignored. Last year the Senate Appropriations Committee. asked the White House for a strategy on human rights for such problematic aid recipients as Colombia, Egypt and Tunisia. The committee is still waiting. In May, the House moved to withhold some of Turkey's military aid because of worries about Cyprus and the Kurds. So Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, complained to Mr Clinton. She made her point. Turkey's aid will continue in 1995.
The final indignity is a shrinking foreign-aid budget, reflecting public distaste for spending American money abroad. Money is tight. After the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, plus another $2.5 billion in multilateral aid to the World Bank and the IMF (see page 73), there is not much left for any kind of new vision.

Slovakia may be an exception. Since taking over in March, the prime minister, Jozef Moravcik, has done much to end the muddle and distrust that were hallmarks of his predecessor, Vladimir Meciar. The country's economy appears to be moving in the right direction. Whether the progress can be maintained depends largely on the outcome of September's general election. But there are three reasons for thinking at least a semblance of stability will endure thereafter.
First, the coalition has mended bridges between Slovaks and the 560,000-strong Hungarian minority. The government has pushed through laws to safeguard Hungarian-language rights; in return, the country's 14 Hungarian deputies have joined Mr Moravcik's four-party coalition. Thanks partly to more conciliatory policies from the new Hungarian government of Gyula Horn, whose recent visit to Bratislava was the first by a Hungarian prime minister since Slovakia split from the Czech Republic in 1993, there is a growing rapprochement between the two countries. A long-running dispute over the Gabcikovo dam on the river Danube (the largest civil-engineering project in Europe) seems to be drawing to a close. A treaty to settle border questions and the treatment of each other's minorities is in the offing All this has done much to repair the damage caused by the nationalist venom of the Meciar regime.
Second, the coalition is beginning to get the economy right. The previous government, says one long-serving finance-ministry official, took ""spontaneous decisions according to political convenience"". This one is sticking to tougher macroeconomic policies. Social spending has been cut, taxes raised and farm subsidies are for the chop. These efforts were rewarded in July when the IMF extended $263m in credits.
Third, the government is racing to ensure that a second wave of voucher privatisation gets under way soon. As many as 500 companies with a combined book value of 220 billion Slovak koruna ($7 billion) are up for grabs, of which $1.6 billion will be sold for vouchers. The hope is that, if Slovaks go to the polls with a pocketful of vouchers, they will reward the politicians who issued them.
All well and good, but the ruling party kicked out before any of this could happen, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), remains the most popular party in the country, with around 30% in the polls. Mr Meciar, its leaner leader (he has sweated off 25 kilos since he lost office), has been pounding the hustings. His populist anti-reform rhetoric finds a ready audience among Slovakia's 15% unemployed, its peasants and the elderly.
HZDS is the richest and best organised party in the country, with a full-time staff of 190, a fleet of vehicles and its own security guards. Augustin Marian Huska, HZDS vice-president, promises that if his party is returned, it will ""correct"" privatisation. The HZDS, he says, is ""pro-foreign investment [but] in terms of development rather than purchase""; his party is ""for a market economy but against the accumulation of capital.""
If the polls are right, HZDS will emerge from the election as the largest party in parliament but without enough seats to form a government outright. So the current coalition partners want to stick together to keep Mr Meciar out. Yet as the election draws near, political differences between its members are sure to surface (it comprises socialists, Christian conservatives, Liberal Democrats and mild nationalists). The one to watch is the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the reformed communists.
The governing SDL is the second-biggest party in parliament and the most popular in the country after HZDS, with 17% in the polls. Its leader, Peter Weiss, is as astute and ambitious as they come. He has put together a broad-left coalition of smaller groups, including the Greens, with whom to fight the election; it may benefit from the success of the government, in which the SDL holds seven of the 18 portfolios.
Next in terms of support come the Christian Democratic Movement, Mr Moravcik's Democratic Union of Slovakia and a three-party right-of-centre coalition. Each claims around 10% support and each is wary of the SDL. What unites them is a desire to keep Mr Meciar out. ""He is a menace to democracy,"" says Milan Knazko, vice-chairman of the Democratic Union and a former foreign minister.
Some believe the outcome of the election will be almost as important for Slovakia as its independence. Mr Knazko argues it ""will decide whether Slovakia goes down the path of confrontation and isolation, or travels along the road of co-operation, stability and democracy."" Fingers crossed.","Countries often disappear down the drain with a quick gurgle and climb back up only after years of toil. Slovakia may be an exception.

All well and good, but the ruling party kicked out before any of this could happen, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), remains the most popular party in the country, with around 30% in the polls. Mr Meciar, its leaner leader (he has sweated off 25 kilos since he lost office), has been pounding the hustings. His populist anti-reform rhetoric finds a ready audience among Slovakia's 15% unemployed, its peasants and the elderly.
HZDS is the richest and best organised party in the country, with a full-time staff of 190, a fleet of vehicles and its own security guards. Augustin Marian Huska, HZDS vice-president, promises that if his party is returned, it will ""correct"" privatisation. The HZDS, he says, is ""pro-foreign investment [but] in terms of development rather than purchase""; his party is ""for a market economy but against the accumulation of capital.""
If the polls are right, HZDS will emerge from the election as the largest party in parliament but without enough seats to form a government outright. So the current coalition partners want to stick together to keep Mr Meciar out. Yet as the election draws near, political differences between its members are sure to surface (it comprises socialists, Christian conservatives, Liberal Democrats and mild nationalists). The one to watch is the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the reformed communists.
The governing SDL is the second-biggest party in parliament and the most popular in the country after HZDS, with 17% in the polls. Its leader, Peter Weiss, is as astute and ambitious as they come. He has put together a broad-left coalition of smaller groups, including the Greens, with whom to fight the election; it may benefit from the success of the government, in which the SDL holds seven of the 18 portfolios.
Next in terms of support come the Christian Democratic Movement, Mr Moravcik's Democratic Union of Slovakia and a three-party right-of-centre coalition. Each claims around 10% support and each is wary of the SDL. What unites them is a desire to keep Mr Meciar out. ""He is a menace to democracy,"" says Milan Knazko, vice-chairman of the Democratic Union and a former foreign minister.
Some believe the outcome of the election will be almost as important for Slovakia as its independence. Mr Knazko argues it ""will decide whether Slovakia goes down the path of confrontation and isolation, or travels along the road of co-operation, stability and democracy.""

Since then the leaping has been less enthusiastic. Efforts to recapture the magic of the Mozart tradition in Prague have usually failed--most embarrassingly in a 1968 recording of ""Don Giovanni"" for Deutsche Grammophon, in which the Prague Philharmonic was conducted by Karl Bohm. The singer of the title role, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, says: ""The orchestra was basically inexperienced with Mozart, and Bohm found them highly inadequate.""
But the European Mozart Foundation, established only in the spring of last year, is determined to succeed where others have failed. Under the artistic leadership of Sandor Vegh, a Hungarian violinist and conductor, it has set out to re-establish Mozart's stature not just in Prague but throughout ex-communist Eastern Europe.
To this end, a few dozen graduate musicians from Eastern Europe are welcomed for ten-month-long seminars. They are taught by such fine musicians as Eduard Brunner, a Swiss clarinet virtuoso, Andre Cazalet, a wizard on the French horn, and, of course, Mr Vegh himself.
At 82, Mr Vegh is one of the few great musicians alive today whose career stretches back before the second world war. He knew and worked with Bartok, and as a violin virtuoso he has played under the direction of such famous musicians as Pablo Casals, Richard Strauss, Willem Mengelberg and Erno Dohnanyi. He is also a fine conductor whose joyous series of Mozart Divertimenti and Serenades for Capriccio Records (13 CDs so far) have won many prizes and merited even more. Mr Vegh is a charming fellow and has been called a ""paprika"" version of Charles Laughton.
The European Mozart Foundation houses its young would-be virtuosi at Dobris Castle outside Prague. In medieval times this mansion and its park were a stamping ground for Bohemia's most famous monarch, Good King Wenceslas. More recently it has been a ""writer's colony"" for Marxist authors.
The foundation itself will move in 1995 to the ancient Jagellonian University in Cracow, before going on eventually to its final home at the ruined Esterhaza Castle in Hungary, where a massive restoration programme is already under way. Although more students will continue to come from Eastern Europe than from anywhere else (all are offered free tuition and board), there will also be many from Western Europe and Asia as well as from America. One of the foundation's principles is that the East has as much to teach the West as vice versa.
In some senses, students from Eastern Europe are quicker at finding the right track in studies than are their classmates. Mr Cazalet notes that when he tells his pupils to listen to recordings made in the 1940s and 1950s by Dennis and Aubrey Brain, two British horn virtuosi who are his musical heroes, there is a readier response from East European students.
Students in the West have their own CD-players and buy lots of new recordings, while practically no student in an East European country can afford to buy a compact disc or record player, so they haunt the public libraries instead, eager to hear the old performances.","The citizens of Prague proudly call their city ""Mozart's town"".

This is no bunch of rag-tag clients. They will come backed by voters and by world financial markets. Without exception--though not all with ease--their countries have long since sent the juntas of the 1970s and 1980s back to barracks. More significant today, their economies are in better shape (see page 39) than for decades. A continent-wide consensus has emerged on the need for stable prices, fiscal austerity and open economies. Most Latin governments have prices under control--Brazil's is the latest, if most precarious, success. Most have deregulated. Even Venezuela, now the black sheep, with high inflation and reinvented exchange and price controls, may join the flock. Attracted by stability, political and economic, and by a private sector furiously modernising, foreign capital has poured in. Voters in Mexico and Brazil this year resisted populist temptations and returned reformers to power; Argentina's will probably do the same next year.
The turnaround from the days of wild inflation, fiscal deficits and debt crisis has been huge. Yet much is still to be done. Sound macroeconomics is only the first--albeit crucial--part of the agenda. It will be harder to create the conditions for lasting prosperity, as in much of Asia, and to ensure that the benefits of reform reach the region's poor majority. And it may be harder still to ensure that democracy means more than voting and must imbue all the institutions of the state, from presidencies to legislatures, bureaucracies, courts and policemen.
Higher, sustainable growth depends in large part on higher exports, and thus on access to rich foreign markets. Mr Clinton is unlikely to offer much but words on this point. Still, the Miami summiteers may make modest progress towards harmonising the patchwork of sub-regional trade accords that has spread over the Americas. Agreement at least to freeze trade barriers and tariffs at today's levels would be a start.
But Latin America can do much to help itself. Almost everywhere growth is held back by outdated institutions. In some places the problems start with politics. In Mexico a year of political turbulence has frightened investors; despite the risk of further violence, the new president, Ernesto Zedillo, must honour his promises to disentangle his ever-ruling party from the state and complete the transition to democracy. Unlike over-centralised Mexico, Argentina and Brazil both urgently need to remake their loose federal systems, which give spending power without fiscal responsibility to state governments.
Most countries need a clutch of other reforms if they are to achieve the greater microeconomic efficiency and more just societies that will sustain prosperity. The first targets are labour and capital markets. In many places it is still hard, and costly, to dismiss workers. So firms hesitate to restructure, while high payroll taxes make it expensive to create new jobs. But faster growth also depends on more investment, in infrastructure and in people. Too much of the capital that is flowing in is used for consumption.
In the longer term, higher investment demands higher domestic savings: Latins cannot rely on foreign capital alone. Governments have already done much to encourage saving, by cutting their own deficits. They can do more (notably by better tax collection), but it is now the turn of the private sector. Though the creation of private pension funds has helped to stimulate domestic capital, much remains to be done. Venture capital is scarce. Entrepreneurship is stifled by inefficient banking systems. Tight family control of big firms means that many Latin stockmarkets remain stunted and illiquid.
Remember the poor
Of the other fields crying out for reform, one is education. In Latin America, as anywhere, the best long-term way to improve the lot of the poorest is better primary schooling. An understandable obsession with quantity must give way to an emphasis on improving quality. That does not mean elitism. It means ensuring that well-trained teachers are there to staff the new schools that presidents are so fond of inaugurating. It means tackling entrenched bureaucracies and public-sector trade unions, to extract more value from limited funds.
Schooling takes time to bring results. Meanwhile, social programmes--if well run and directed at the right targets--can do much to help. Many Latin countries set up emergency social funds when they began to reform. These must be backed by permanent programmes. Services specifically aimed at the health care and nutrition of the poorest must be high on the budgetary agenda.
The last area ripe for reform is the justice system. In some countries, it is under the thumb of the executive; in many it is short of cash; almost everywhere it is cocooned in a pettifogging legalism that co-exists with widespread violence, corruption and contempt for law. Business, ordinary citizens and democracy itself all require swifter and less arbitrary justice.
Nowhere will improvement occur overnight. Creating the conditions for sustainable prosperity is not easy. But without it what has already been achieved remains at risk. Voters have learned that quick-fix solutions do not work, that populist policies of higher spending paid for with funny money merely end in higher inflation, which hurts the poor the most.

Many marched with flaming torches past the grey citadel of the government's headquarters in Scotland, the Scottish Office, and on past the sooty pillars of an old school housing the chamber built in the 1970s for that decade's planned but aborted Scottish Assembly.
This was no Wenceslas Square-style outburst of revolutionary fervour, merely part of Edinburgh's Homanay celebrations. But opinion polls suggest that four-fifths of Scottish voters now want some kind of assembly, as opposed to a mere 32.9% who turned out to vote for it in a 1979 referendum. If they are denied it, the next big marches may be for constitutional reform.
John Major recently characterised devolution as ""teenage madness"". Scots were not amused. One Scottish Labour MP found his own Homanay tippling liberally laced with friends' reactions to Mr Major. ""People don't like what looks like pig ignorance and a 'we will tell you what's best' attitude"", he observed.
Unfortunately for Mr Major, many Scots who are neither teenage nor mad do favour devolution. They include most Church of Scotland ministers. At the prompting of Sir Bruce Pattullo, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, even members of Scotland's financial community, traditionally hostile to devolution, have talked to Labour about how it might work. Labour promised the financiers that devolution would not affect company taxes or financial regulation.
Of the 82% of Scottish voters who want constitutional change, according to a 1994 ICM poll, 38% favour independence and 44% support devolution. Mr Major's assertion that devolution is impossible might tip some Labour supporters into the camp of the Scottish Nationalists who advocate full independence. That's why Jim Sillars, a former SNP MP, greeted Mr Major's remarks as ""dead brilliant"".
On January 4th, outside the empty Assembly building, a round-the-clock ""vigil for a Scottish parliament"" notched up its 100th day. The occasional passing car toots a horn, the odd pedestrian gives a donation. But even those hurrying past the volunteers huddling round the vigil's brazier have plenty to say about home rule. Derek King, a pensioner, thought devolution would be ""a very good thing. Scotland doesn't get a good deal."" Walter Strachan, walking home from the shops with his wife, said he wants full independence, not some watered-down alternative. ""Anything in-between is going to cost the Scottish people a lot of money. We'll be paying up in the pound more taxation than the English.""
This, of course, is precisely Mr Major's argument. It shows that the devolution debate, a yawn to most Englishmen, may yet resonate in unexpected ways, north of the Border.","AROUND 150,000 Edinburgh citizens took to the city's streets last weekend.

If they are denied it, the next big marches may be for constitutional reform.
John Major recently characterised devolution as ""teenage madness"". Scots were not amused. One Scottish Labour MP found his own Homanay tippling liberally laced with friends' reactions to Mr Major. ""People don't like what looks like pig ignorance and a 'we will tell you what's best' attitude"", he observed.
Unfortunately for Mr Major, many Scots who are neither teenage nor mad do favour devolution. They include most Church of Scotland ministers. At the prompting of Sir Bruce Pattullo, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, even members of Scotland's financial community, traditionally hostile to devolution, have talked to Labour about how it might work. Labour promised the financiers that devolution would not affect company taxes or financial regulation.
Of the 82% of Scottish voters who want constitutional change, according to a 1994 ICM poll, 38% favour independence and 44% support devolution. Mr Major's assertion that devolution is impossible might tip some Labour supporters into the camp of the Scottish Nationalists who advocate full independence. That's why Jim Sillars, a former SNP MP, greeted Mr Major's remarks as ""dead brilliant"".
On January 4th, outside the empty Assembly building, a round-the-clock ""vigil for a Scottish parliament"" notched up its 100th day. The occasional passing car toots a horn, the odd pedestrian gives a donation. But even those hurrying past the volunteers huddling round the vigil's brazier have plenty to say about home rule. Derek King, a pensioner, thought devolution would be ""a very good thing. Scotland doesn't get a good deal."" Walter Strachan, walking home from the shops with his wife, said he wants full independence, not some watered-down alternative. ""Anything in-between is going to cost the Scottish people a lot of money. We'll be paying up in the pound more taxation than the English.""
This, of course, is precisely Mr Major's argument. It shows that the devolution debate, a yawn to most Englishmen, may yet resonate in unexpected ways, north of the Border.",310,Hungary,A29-4558,,False,,0,True

Botched privatisation deals, a rudderless central bank, tensions in the coalition, looming financial problems--all now confront a government that started from a position of strength only six months ago.
Hopes were high in Hungary in July 1994 when a coalition of Socialists (reformed communists) and liberals took over from an unpopular conservative government and began a four-year term with a two-thirds majority in parliament. Since then, however, only a few measures of any significance have been made law. The most important of these was a budget rushed through parliament at the last minute, which finance-ministry officials admit is unrealistic. The rest of the ambitious legislative programme--including privatisation, liberalising laws on the media and an agreement with the IMF--is in limbo.
Part of the problem is that the government, vaunted as a cabinet of technocrats, has proved less technocratic than expected. Reformed communists such as the prime minister, Gyula Horn, who were at the vanguard of change in the late 1980s, now look old-fashioned. Hungary, the pioneer of market reform in ex-communist Eastern Europe, has changed more than they have. They cannot attract enough good people into government. Sometimes this is to Hungary's benefit, since it means the best minds stay in the private sector (which accounts for 55% of the economy). But there is a cost.
One example is the central bank. For months the new government tried to prod its governor, Peter Akos Bod, a political appointee of the former government, into resigning. Two months after he eventually obliged, the government has still not found a replacement. Several candidates, ensconced in private-sector jobs, have turned the post down. Worse still, Mr Horn seems to have balked at the conditions set by the markets' favourite for the job, Gyorgy Suranyi. Mr Suranyi, who was governor in 1990 and 1991, wants the central bank to be made independent in fact as well as in law. He also wants a say in economic policy and the appointment of deputy governors.
The dispute has become another irritant within the government. Mr Suranyi is backed by the junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats (liberals), and by moderates in the Socialist Party, notably the finance minister, Laszlo Bekesi. But Mr Horn is unenthusiastic, partly because he comes from the left of the Socialist Party and partly because he dislikes ceding power to anyone.
The latest victim of Mr Horn's hands-on style is Ferenc Bartha, the government's privatisation chief, who was sacked on January 12th. In mid-December Mr Bartha made his first privatisation deal when, after long negotiations, he agreed to sell 51% of the country's last state-owned hotel chain to an American investor. The sale was unpopular. There was political pressure to hand the chain over to the cash-strapped state-run social-security fund, which is backed by trade unions that support the Socialist Party. Others thought the price too low. So the cabinet overruled the privatisation agency (which is supposed to be independent) and cancelled the sale. It also sacked the respected Mr Bartha (who is another former governor of the central bank).
Foreign investors are furious, saying the cancellation of the deal and Mr Bartha's removal have sapped confidence in Hungary and augur badly for plans to start selling energy firms this spring. In the wake of the Mexican wave on the currency and stock markets, this is a bad time for an emerging country to be upsetting foreign investors. Since Hungary wants to sell bonds abroad this year and has attracted more foreign direct investment than any other East European country ($7 billion in the past six years), this matters a lot.
So does the impact on the public finances. Hungary's foreign debt rose to $28 billion last year, the highest per head in Eastern Europe. Tough spending cuts are one part of the debt-reduction programme--and are opposed by many in government who say they were elected to soften the pain of reform. The other part consists of privatisation receipts. The government is counting on $3 billion-4 billion during the next two years. Without these, the budget--and the economy--will look even rockier.","Hungary is heading for the rocks .

Last month, the ruling Social Democrats signed an agreement with the country's most extreme parliamentary group, the openly anti-Semitic and generally racist Great Romania Party. The pact also involved the former communists, now renamed the Socialist Labour Party. Since a hysterically anti-Hungarian party, the Romanian National Unity Party, had joined the cabinet last August, nasties of every stripe are now in government.
Western diplomats pointed out beforehand that such alliances would not improve the image of a country trying to attract foreign investment and prepare the way for membership of the European Union. Most Romanians, however, think the pact merely formalises a tacit agreement with the three extremist parties that has existed since 1992 when the Social Democrats emerged as the biggest party, just, in the general election. In return for support for its minority government in parliament, the Social Democrats have doled out lots of junior ministerial posts and other plum jobs to the extremists.
Their influence shows. Foreigners complain that contact with Romanian officials has become more difficult. They now find soldiers at the entrance to ministries whose doors were once open to them. The coolness of the welcome owes something to the disillusion with reform and the outside world felt by many Romanians: they expected more help from the West in overcoming the legacy of 25 years of Nicolae Ceausescu. But it also owes something to the ""growing nastiness, the toughening up"" identified by a western diplomat. ""It was always there but it's got worse since the nationalist parties got closer to power.""
One example of the extremists' influence is the rehabilitation of Marshal Ion Antonescu, Romania's military dictator in the second world war. Through their new jobs in the media, culture and education, the extremists are now able to promote their hero. Antonescu fought the Russians, allied Romania with Nazi Germany and allowed hundreds of thousands of Jews to be killed or deported to concentration camps in Poland. Yet state television recently aired a one-sided documentary, produced and distributed by agencies of the ministry of culture, which portrayed Antonescu as a great man. Ministry officials also attended the unveiling of a statue of the marshal. The unamused American ambassador said bluntly last month that a statue of Antonescu in Romania was equivalent to one of Hitler in Germany or Mussolini in Italy.
Westerners are not the only ones alarmed by the turn of events. The new Hungarian government would like to sign a friendship treaty and put centuries of wrangling over Transylvania, Romania's ethnically mixed western province, behind the two neighbouring states. The Hungarians are prepared to recognise borders and renounce territorial claims, if, in return, Romania will guarantee the rights of the 1.6m ethnic Hungarians on its side of the border.
But Romanian nationalists are doing their best to prevent a deal. Last month, Gheorghe Funar, the leader of the anti-Hungarian party and the wiliest Romanian nationalist of all, intensified his calls to ban the ethnic Hungarians' political party. He also asked for ethnic Hungarians to be prosecuted for flying Hungarian flags or singing foreign anthems, and to be thrown out of the armed forces.
The government distanced itself from Mr Funar, but then issued its own tough statements against ethnic Hungarians. In response, the Hungarian prime minister, Gyula Horn, cancelled talks with a Romanian delegation on the morning they were due to take place last week. The row has dampened Hungarian hopes of quickly concluding the friendship treaty that is a condition of both countries' membership of the European Union and NATO.

He studied at Moscow's elite Institute of International Relations before going back to Bulgaria for a top job in the youth organization of Bulgaria's pre-1989 communist party. Jozef Oleksy, Poland's prime minister-designate, was a member of his country's last communist government. Gyula Horn, the Hungarian prime minister, joined the local militia that helped Soviet troops crush his country's 1956 uprising and was its last communist foreign minister.
Five years after the demise of communism, former communists seem to be back everywhere you look. Even in the Czech Republic, the Central European country farthest from central planning, the minister responsible for industry and trade, Vladimir Dlouhy, left the Communist Party only after the ""velvet revolution"".
In the euphoria of 1989 and 1990, many people in Central and Eastern Europe hoped that a new group of rulers, untainted by communism, would emerge. Poland's first post-communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, promised ""a clear chalk line with the past"". Bulgaria banned senior ex-communists from top academic posts. Nearly all the countries passed ""lustration laws"", which tried to stop those who had played repressive roles in the past from holding high office again.
Every former communist regime has had to face two problems. One was deciding what constituted a communist. A party card proved little, especially since by the 1980s it was often little more than a career tool. In Hungary, for example, the conservative coalition that came to power in 1990 promised that ""all communists would go"". Arguments raged over what this should really mean. Eventually, a panel of judges was appointed to screen 15,000 people in senior positions for past contacts with the secret police. Now the panel, whose operations have been a shambles, has collapsed after allegations that two of the three judges themselves had murky links with the old communist regime.
The second problem was the difficulty of replacing a nation's entire ruling elite when all were plainly tainted to some degree by communism. Where there has been competition for jobs, many government officials have been replaced. An official at the Hungarian foreign ministry reckons that about half his colleagues and most of those who served in the culture ministry are out. But at the ministry of interior, there has been little turnover. On balance, most civil servants have remained stuck in their jobs: the youngsters who might have replaced them prefer to seek work in the far more remunerative private sector.
Many people in Eastern Europe worry that the new reformed-communist presidents and prime ministers, backed by ex-communists in the civil service, could slip back into nasty old authoritarian habits. A lingering fondness for Russia is another worry. Poland's former foreign minister, Andrzej Olechowski, criticises today's outgoing prime minister, Waldemar Pawlak, for cosying up to the Kremlin.
Are such understandable suspicions still justified? In one or two places, the laws are being changed to benefit the old nomenklatura, the communist-approved elite. Since the Polish government recently decided to insist that privatisation-fund managers must have had experience running a state enterprise, the average age of those applying has shot up from 34 to 56. Bulgaria's new government says it will abolish its laws banning ex-communists from academic jobs. One reason for such decisions is that few countries can afford to discriminate against efficient people simply because they prospered in the twilight years of communism. Some of the cleverest former communists have subsequently become successful capitalists.
Thanks to their skills, plus opportunism and the old-comrade network, many now run privatised industries. In Poland, former party members still hold 90% of top banking jobs. In Romania, Radu Tinu, deputy head of the dreaded secret police in the Timis region, is one of the richest businessmen in Timisoara, where the Romanian revolution started. When countries are short of capable, entrepreneurial people, they may sometimes have to forgive the past--or jeopardise prosperity in the future.","ZHAN VIDENOV , Bulgaria 's 35 - year - old prime minister , was groomed for power -- communist power .

IN LATE January, the welfare mothers of Massachusetts got a nasty shock. From the governor, William Weld, came a letter telling them that, unless the state legislature passed a welfare-reform law to his liking, the benefit cheques they were to receive in February would be their last. Days later the legislature complied. Meanwhile, 3,000 miles away, California's governor, Pete Wilson, was submitting a budget that proposed billions in welfare cuts while at the same time pursuing a court case to let California pay lower benefits to poor people newly arrived in his state.
The bi-coastal doings of two big-name Republican governors would be of interest at any time. But this week they are of particular moment. On March 21st the House of Representatives took up welfare reform. Days later, after a fiercely acrimonious debate, the Republicans were on the brink of passing a bill that will dramatically alter America's social safety net, in large part by transferring authority over programmes for the poor from the federal government to the country's assorted states.
Generating the most attention--and the most anguish--are the tough new restrictions the House bill would impose on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), a programme which currently sends cheques to about 14m poor single women and their children. Such families would be limited to five years of benefits and required to work after two of those years. Mothers under 18 would get no cash at all; nor would cheques increase for those having new babies while they were still on the rolls. Legal immigrants could be cut off, too--not just from AFDC but from all federal assistance, including health care and food stamps.
These mandates aside, however, the House welfare bill lets the states' governors have their heads. Money would be sent to the states in the form of lump-sum block rants to be spent as the governors see fit. As spelled out by Republican governors such as Mr Weld, Mr Wilson and Michigan's John Engler, the argument for devolution is simple. It is the states that know their welfare needs best; it is the states that have led the way with bold reforms. Give us the cash and cut the strings, they say, and the results will be at once efficient and experimental.
There is no doubt that experimenting with welfare is all the rage in statehouses across the land. Fully 44 of them, out of the total of 50, have introduced changes to their systems, many within the past year. Indeed, a sort of domino effect has taken hold, with states trading ideas and personnel. In Massachusetts the new human-services secretary, Gerald Whitburn, was previously one of the architects of Wisconsin's famously tough reform regime. Now he oversees Mr Weld's, which--by requiring work after 60 days, imposing a two-year limit on benefits and denying extra cash for extra babies--will be the toughest in the nation.
In theory, that is. The question is what will happen in practice. More than a few Republican governors have instituted welfare reforms which look radical on the surface but are far less so underneath. Consider Mr Engler, who never ceases to blow his horn about how in Michigan ""welfare reform means work"". But when David Whitman examined the record more closely for the New Republic, he found that ""work"" means ""work activities"", which range from attending classes to checking a book out of a library. Fewer than 1% of Michigan's recipients are toiling in workfare jobs.
This is not surprising. For the awkward truth is that putting welfare mothers to work costs more than sending them cheques: $6,000 more per recipient, reckons the Congressional Budget Office, to pay for supervisors, day care and the like. Yet it is a Republican article of faith that, in Mr Engler's words, ""welfare reform must save money.""
And so even the toughest-talking governors typically leave their work requirements with plenty of wiggle room. Mr Whitburn admits that only 20% of the recipients in Massachusetts will be covered by all of the new law's provisions. Of these, he reckons that fewer than 10% will fail to find work in the private sector and hence need to be given costly community-service jobs. But if the number proves much bigger, says Joseph Gallant, the state's welfare commissioner, a new category of exemption from the work requirement--""vocationally disabled"", he suggests--may have to be created.
Such sleight of hand is understandable, if shortsighted. What governor would want to be seen as splurging on welfare? Voters are taxophobic, and, though some have sympathy for the poor, it rarely extends to their wallets. But Republican governors are not just failing to spend money to reform welfare. Everywhere you look, they are hacking away mercilessly at benefits.
Mr Wilson's court case may suggest an increasingly powerful reason why. In 1992 the governor became worried that California's social programmes were so generous that they were luring poor people: that they were, in short, turning the state into a ""welfare magnet"". So Mr Wilson pushed through a law that would set up a two-tier welfare system, in which newcomers would for one year receive the same benefits that they had been getting in the states whence they came. But a federal judge in Sacramento ruled the law to be unconstitutional.
Mr Wilson is not the only one worried about his state's magnetism. Wisconsin's Republican governor, Tommy Thompson, enacted a two-tier regime to deter welfare migrants drifting north from Chicago. Indeed, as governors have passed ever more stringent reforms, neighbouring states have raced to tighten their own systems, at least partly out of fear that they face an influx of the indigent flooding across their borders.
Are these fears reasonable? Possibly. In the short run, many welfare mothers (especially the long-term ones) are amazingly unaffected by changes of circumstances or incentives. Most people who cross borders may seem to do so in search of jobs, not higher welfare payments. Yet, over the long run, research by academics such as Paul Peterson and Rebecca Blank has found that states with generous welfare systems tend to attract the poor. Massachusetts's Mr Gallant says he has heard stories that, soon after Mr Weld signed his reform bill, there was an increase in welfare claims just across the border in Rhode Island.
Whether or not welfare migration is a huge problem matters less than the fact that governors and state legislators think it is. So long as they do, they will be tempted to slash welfare to keep the poor from coming in to their states--or, more ominously, to drive out the ones already there. And this temptation will be made worse by the plans of Republicans in Congress. Mr Peterson points out that, because block grants are fixed, all the marginal costs of additional welfare recipients will be borne by the states, creating a powerful incentive for politicians to make their welfare systems as mean as possible.
By using block grants to shift welfare back to the states, Republicans may really be hoping for innovation and experimentation. They may even get those things. But there is a risk, says Mr Peterson, that what they will get is a ""race to the bottom.""","BOSTON , MASSACHUSETTS SACREMENTO , CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON , DC

Though at first it dilly-dallied over reform, it has now produced an economic reform package so radical that it has turned Hungarian politics upside down.
The package was assembled by two well-known bankers, Lajos Bokros and Gyorgy Suranyi, who became finance minister and central bank governor respectively on March 1st. Their aim is to cut this year's government spending by 170 billion forints ($1.4 billion) and the budget deficit by a third. They also hope to cut imports by imposing an 8% surchare on most goods and to boost exports by devaluing the forint by 28% over the course of this year.
The budget cuts represent the most serious effort since the end of communism to trim back Hungary's huge welfare state and bloated public administration. They are under attack from opposition conservatives and liberals, who say the measures will ruin the country and push many people below the poverty line. Left-wing politicians, including the prime minister, Gyula Horn, a former top communist, insist the cuts are unavoidable and that a country as indebted as Hungary cannot afford to spend the equivalent of 27% of annual GDP on welfare and social services.
Messrs Bokros and Suranyi have convinced the prime minister that, among other things, automatic child care benefits, two years' maternity pay, free higher education and thousands of public sector jobs will have to go. Without the squeeze on spending, the country cannot hope to reduce its burgeoning budget and current account deficits or its $28 billion gross foreign debt, which remains the highest, per person, in Eastern Europe.
Luckily for Mr Horn, the next general election is not due for three years. Hungarians are livid. They consider the welfare system, which has delivered cash benefits to most households for years, a part of their national heritage. An opinion poll conducted by Szonda Ipsos, a local market research company, found that two-thirds of Hungarians were ""outraged"" at the reform package, while a mere 4% believed the reforms would improve the country's finances in a big way.
For most Hungarians, the tough measures--agreed by the cabinet in a single Sunday afternoon--were a shot out of the blue. This was a government which only last autumn had increased pensions retroactively and delayed price rises for energy. Earlier this year, Mr Horn had cancelled one high-profile privatisation deal and engineered the resignation of Laszlo Bekesi, the cabinet's chief reformer, who was Mr Bokros's predecessor as finance minister. But Mr Horn was forced into a U-turn by figures showing that last year's current-account deficit had soared to a record $3.9 billion and by plunging investor confidence.
More than 30 laws will have to be amended for the whole package to pass. It is bound to be watered down in parliament. Two ministers have already resigned over the welfare cuts; trade unions are threatening strikes; students are already demonstrating. But the Socialist-led coalition, with 72% of the seats, has a big majority in parliament. Even the grumblers seem to accept that, if the economy is to recover, it needs harsh medicine. If that delivers steady growth, Hungarians might even be ready to re-elect the government in 1998.","AFTER a rocky start , Hungary 's Socialist - led government , which came to power nine months ago , may have come to its senses .

Certainly, some Americans have grown impatient with their European allies of late; and some Europeans, no loner troubled by Soviet communism, see less need to keep their old friendship with the Yanks in good repair. Others, however, on both sides of the Atlantic, appear anxious to ease the strains. Hence some of the audio confusion: a zipper being fastened makes much the same noise as one being undone.
It would, in any event, be a mistake to ignore the tensions. They show themselves in differences over Bosnia, the enlargement of NATO, policy towards Russia, sanctions against Iran--even perhaps in Bill Clinton's absence from VE-Day celebrations in London. Differences among the North Atlantic partners are not new; the alliance has survived worse. But the common enemy is now one, and with it the most obvious source of pressure holding the group together. The allies feel freer to disagree openly. In refusing to enforce the arms blockade on Bosnia, America has for the first time unilaterally turned its back on its NATO allies.
Moreover, irritation with West Europeans is not confined to the relatively few Americans who concern themselves with ex-Yugoslavia. It is conspicuous among the new Republican majority in Congress, for whom economics, or rather bookkeeping, sometimes seems more important than history or geopolitics. They see a group of rich countries in the European Union, well able to pay for their own defence, unsympathetic to Republican policies on aid and the United Nations, and often at loggerheads with America on trade.
Underlying the change in Congress is a change in America. With increased immigration from Asia and Latin America, an ever-smaller proportion of Americans trace their ancestry back to Europe. And with American exporters' eyes now fixed on the gee-whizz markets round the Pacific, the slow-growing, mature economies of Western Europe seem dull by comparison. Already trade across the Pacific is half as much again as across the Atlantic. East Asia is likely to become the world's biggest market by the end of the century. No wonder Mr Clinton and the leaders of 14 other countries in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum committed themselves last November to free trade and investment by 2020. A month later every head of government in the Americas (except Fidel Castro) was signing up for free trade from Alaska to Cape Horn by 2005.
It may not happen. Even if it did, it would neglect some other economic statistics: that over half America's entire direct investment abroad is in Europe, for instance. Indeed, America has more in Britain alone than in all of the Asia-Pacific area. Asians know this. Lee Kuan Yew, the grand old man of Singapore, was warning them of the dangers of antagonism America only last week. ""The United States already has in place transatlantic institutions in defence, security and politics, and could extend such institutions into economic areas,"" he said. He no doubt had in mind a transatlantic free-trade area--TAFTA--that would bring together the three big countries of North America and the 15 of the European Union: 750m people with a gross regional economy of over $15 trillion.
That is not altogether a flight of fancy. Canada first suggested it. The new speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, wants it pursued. Germany is well disposed. Britain is developing the theme, most recently in a speech by its foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, last weekend. The Clinton administration is ""intrigued"". The European Union's trade commissioner favours an initiative of some kind.
It is not immediately obvious, however, that the world needs TAFTA when it has only just got the World Trade Organisation. The danger with free-trade areas is that they may divert more trade than they create. Such areas are never actually free; it is hard, for example, to see how all Europe's tariffs on farm trade could be quickly abolished, desirable as that would be. And other industries would present formidable difficulties. Better to press ahead towards free trade within the WTO.
Think NATO as well as TAFTA
Given that these days Europe and America block free trade as often as they further it, strengthening the WTO to deal with these recalcitrants is especially important. The only exceptions would lie in areas in which the WTO is unlikely to make early progress. Thus, a transatlantic deal could do a useful job if it opened up financial services and public procurement, if it attacked government subsidies, set common merger-and-acquisition rules and chopped away the protectionist use of national standards. Even then, however, the governments involved would be asking that others trust that they truly seek free trade. Given that America's trade policy has taken a nasty turn (see page 18), such trust cannot be taken for ranted.
That done, progress on trade would surely help to cement the North Atlantic alliance: a bit of repointing of the brickwork, if not a complete rebuilding job. Yet would they do much more? Economics and security should go hand in hand, and the European Union, whatever its shortcomings, shows that economic co-operation can lead on to a much more elaborate and cohesive joint undertaking; the EU staged out, after all, as a club for coal and steel producers. Certainly, good relations in economic affairs mean that in other areas disputes are less troublesome and common objectives easier to attain. But economics and free trade are not necessarily enough. It is idle to imagine that, in a world devoid of tariffs and trade barriers, disagreements, and indeed wars, would not arise. It is equally idle to imagine that relations between North America and Western Europe can be wholly invigorated by a round of trade talks. To believe that is certainly to do less than justice to the full range of values and interests that they have in common.
These values and interests reflect what is broadly a common outlook, arising from broadly the same cultural tradition and directed at broadly the same set of aims and ideals. They have been responsible for much of the world's present shape. They are not all noble or immune to criticism. But in the second part of this century they have seen off fascism and communism, laid the foundations for democracy in countries that had known little but despotism, and helped to spread prosperity on a scale unsurpassed in human history.
If North America and Europe can maintain the dynamism of this shared identity, they can continue to shape the world for the better. To do so they need not just good commercial relations but something like a shared foreign and security policy. At a minimum there will be threats to their shared interests. What these threats will be no one can say, but some of the candidates--resurgent Russia, intolerant Islam, nuclear-armed desperado states--are closer to Europe than to America. NATO is the organisation to deal with such threats, though not, to be sure, the NATO of yesterday that was designed to fight the Russians, but rather a new NATO of tomorrow.

Greens, especially in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific north-west, are seen as job-destroying flatlanders. With some reason: in recent years, green lobbyists in Washington have successfully pushed for less grazing, mining, dam-building and timber-cutting. What they seemed to ignore was that, in the west, many small towns live and die by federal land and environmental policy.
Now, as environmental bills face a much less friendly Congress, small towns are getting a second look. Well-known financers of environmental causes, such as the Ford Foundation, are now subsidising groups like the Sonoran Institute of Tucson, Arizona. This organisation focuses on ""gateway communities"": western towns whose economy and culture are based on public lands. Actin in the belief that good land use cannot be handed down from above, the Sonoran Institute encourages local communities to find their own solutions to growth and economic problems.
Sheridan, Wyoming, had a visit from the institute recently. Sheridan is a typical ""gateway community"", nestling at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains. Its beauty and quiet, and its old cowboy character, have recently been discovered: residential housing permits have risen by 88% in the past year.
The surrounding county covers 1.6m acres, of which a third is federally owned. The two biggest employers in town are the Veterans' Administration hospital ($20m in annual wages, a staff of 519), and two coal companies ($20m a year in wages, 463 workers), which produce low-sulphur coal from shallow strip mines. There is much demand for the coal, but the mines are ugly.
Sheridan also has a sawmill that cuts studs, which are used to construct the frames of houses. Stud mills generally show the slimmest profit margins in the forest-product industry; they rely on volume to make money. But the Forest Service wants to reduce the annual cut on the Bighorns from 15m board-feet to 4.5m. The mill manager says that, if that happens, he will have to close down.
It is a familiar problem. Logging and mining play havoc with the environment, which in turn puts pesky federal officials on westerners' backs; yet these industries also offer year-round high wages. What is the alternative? The hospital is a ""clean"" place to work, but it seems bound to lose jobs in the future. A developer in neighbouring Big Horn (an unincorporated township with about 400 people and a single general store) wants to build a golf course and 600 new houses. But tourism and the second-home industry do not pay well: not many people in Sheridan want their children to eke out a living ""making beds for some Californian"", as one woman puts it. And the work, in this part of the country, is not constant. People come to Wyoming in winter to ski, hunt and career round on snowmobiles, but Big Horn's golf course will be under several feet of snow.
The west wants ""sustainable commodity development"" and ""value-added jobs"". But part of Sheridan's uncertainty lies in defining what ""sustainable"" is. Luther Propst of the Sonoran Institute says it means ""living off the interest, not the principal""; but this is still a tricky rule for confused and nervous small towns.
Money helps. The Sonoran Institute recently formed the Corporation for the Northern Rockies, which will, among other services, lend money to environmentally friendly small businesses. EcoTrust of Portland, Oregon, which concentrates on the towns of the Pacific coastal rain forests, is trying to do the same, but with fewer environmental criteria. People in these areas have been lectured enough. What they need, according to Ecotrust's director, Spencer Beebe, is ""self-interest in conservation"".
EcoTrust applied this concept to Willapa Bay, in Washington state. Because the area has little federal land, this watershed of streams, rivers and ocean inlets has not felt the pinch as badly as other timber areas depending on owl-protected National Forests. Its oyster beds and cranberry bogs are doing fine. Yet unemployment runs at 10%, and the population of the county seat, South Bend, has dwindled from 5,000 to 1,500.
Suspicious of egg-headed ideas, but hard-up enough to listen, locals are divided over EcoTrust's ideal of conservation-based development. Most agree that the area ought to build on, and market, its natural resources. But several green ideas from EcoTrust have flopped. First a furniture factory, then a Belgian soap plant, were talked about but never built. There is talk of a brewery now, but residents are sceptical.
EcoTrust admits that the ""build it and they will come"" approach did not work, and has shifted its emphasis to supporting local entrepreneurs. To this end, it recently opened the ShoreTrust Trading Group, a small lending organisation founded to support conservation-based development. A partner in this venture is the Shorebank Corporation of Chicago, a community development bank which specialises in lending to poor districts. ShoreTrust plans to make only two loans this year, and harbours few illusions of grandeur.
Mr Beebe is determined that ShoreTrust shall be not a boutique bank, serving only those who pass an environmental litmus test, but a general lender to entrepreneurs throughout the Willapa Bay region. He is prepared for a long haul. ""This type of sustainable development takes a long time. Its constituency must be built house by house, farm by farm, oyster bed by oyster bed.

Then everything, slowly, went flat. The 8,000, mostly young, French-speakers packed to the roof of Quebec city's ice-hockey arena shifted from thunderous triumph to unease, alarm, quiet gloom, at last defiant despair. As a nail-bitten evening ended on October 30th, Quebec, by one percentage point in a hue 94% turnout, had voted to stay with Canada and--as these separatists saw it--against itself.
Or rather, some not-quite Quebeckers had. A bitter premier, Jacques Parizeau, explained his defeat: ""money 
big business, fairly solidly against him
 and the ethnic vote"". By this he meant the province's 10% of immigrants, who mostly prefer English to French as their adopted tongue (even Montreal's many Haitians and Lebanese do not vote separatist). Plus, though Mr Parizeau did not quite say it, the slightly fewer native English-speakers who--they thought--are an accepted part of Quebec society.
Next day, as the defeated Mr Parizeau announced that at the end of the legislative session he would step down from the leadership of his Parti Quebecois (PQ) the province's premiership and its ""national"" assembly, he apologised for this much jumped-on gaffe. But he insisted that, albeit ill-expressed, it was true. So it is. And this continuing, indeed widening, gap between Quebec's four-fifths majority of French-speakers and the rest--which also means the rest of Canada--explains what has hit that country since the referendum campaign began. It also explains the conundrum that the federal government and the nine other provinces now face: in brief, what is now to be done?
The separatists will be back, and soon; they made that repeatedly plain this week. They have a litany of economic complaints. But their real ones are linguistic: they want total control of Quebec's language law, especially as applied to schools, and of immigration (cosmopolitan Montreal island is less than two-thirds French-speaking). But even if they are given all that, they have the unanswerable demand of un peuple: we want un pays, a country.
Separation has been on the way for decades. To go no further back, it is seven years since Mr Parizeau came to the top of the PQ. Since then, two attempts to satisfy Quebec's constitutional demands (made by Quebec's Liberals, not the PQ) have failed--in essence, because too many of Canada's English-speakers would not wear them. In 1990, Lucien Bouchard, having left the federal cabinet, formed the Bloc Quebecois to fight elections at federal level and in October 1993 led it to a remarkable success, second only to the federal Liberals. Eleven months later it was Mr Parizeau's turn, as he swept the local Liberals out of power in Quebec.
Economics played its part in both elections. But at the root was resurgent French-speaking nationalism, helped in Mr Parizeau's case by a split among Quebec's Liberals, when some walked out to form the soft-nationalist Action Dmocratique party, now led by a 25-year-old, Mario Dumont. ""English"" Canada understood with its head, maybe, what was going on, but not with its heart. It still does not. The referendum campaign has been full of Anglo astonishment that anyone could want to part from a country that is, cliche of the season, ""the envy of the world"". When Messrs Parizeau, Bouchard and Dumont got together in June to agree on a ""soft"" referendum question--not a straight split from Canada, but one that would follow an attempt to negotiate a future partnership--federalist alarm bells should have been ringing. They were not.
Until early last month, this complacency seemed justified. The economic risks of separation looked large, even in the separatists' calculations, let alone the federalists' (the federal finance minister at one point dreamed up a million job losses for Quebec). Canada's Liberal prime minister, Jean Chretien, basically decided to let the separatists cut their own throats.
Monday's cliff-hanger showed how wrong he had been. Three weeks earlier Mr Parizeau had stepped aside to let the separatist campaign be led by the far more popular Mr Bouchard, whose charisma is such that little old Quebecoises have been seen eager just to touch the man who last winter escaped--minus a leg--from flesh-eating bacteria. From that moment the campaign, and the opinion polls, changed. Why? Because Mr Bouchard put his side's economic calculus into the cupboard and took out of it the big French drum.
He is good at lofty emotion, brilliant at rancour, Mr Bouchard. By ill chance for Canada, Mr Chretien is a French-speaker from Quebec but hated by many there for his alleged part in ancient, and some more recent, political wrong. Last week, when he belatedly addressed a television appeal to Quebeckershis privilege as prime minister--and rashly gave Mr Bouchard equal time immediately after him, the separatist tore into, not his arguments, but his treachery towards his own province and towards Rene Levesque, the separatists' great myth-figure, nearly 15 years ago. Time stops for nationalist history.
This week, having declared before the vote that he did not want any of those ""moral victories that are really defeats"", Mr Bouchard was defiant when he got just that: the fight would go on. Haling, compromise? Forget it. Even Mr Parizeau's announcement of his retirement was not that of a beaten man. I am passing on the torch, he said, in effect, to a new generation. We lost, just as Levesque lost an earlier referendum in 1980, but look how much round we've made: from 40% to almost 50%. And we won a large majority (about 60% in fact) of Quebec's French-speakers. A la prochaine (to the next time), as Levesque famously said after that earlier defeat.
Mr Parizeau lamented that the separatist cause had made no inroads among English- and other speakers. But his successor--probably Mr Bouchard--does not need to win over those who will not be won. All he needs (maybe in a fresh referendum, quite soon) is to swing another 5% of his own kind behind him. And it will be French drum and horn, and defiance of Ottawa and of le Canada anglais, that do it, not dusty economics or even jobs.
This is why some premiers of English-speaking provinces were running around this week with unusual phrases on their lips. ""We have heard you, we will work with you,"" Alberta's Ralph Klein told Quebec. It is not that these men suddenly love Quebec, they don't. Even the huge Montreal love-in on October 27th, to which non-Quebeckers poured in, some from the Pacific coast even, was not the true voice of Anglo Canada: much of it is fed to the back teeth with Quebec. But what the campaign, and the vote, have shown is that most Canadians do in fact feel for Canada, and have suddenly understood that it really could fall apart.
The provincial premiers reflect that feeling. Not perhaps as sincerely as their voters, since love of Canada is almost equalled by their desire to get Ottawa out of their provincial hair. Hence the cry on all sides for change, to keep Quebec in--for Canada's sake, not its own--and Ottawa out. But it has to be added that no one is volunteering for a third constitutional marathon, and that cries for change rang loudly after the previous Quebec referendum; producing, in the end, damn all. asdklgj;","THE blue-and-white banners waved, the chanteurs sang their throats out against les federastes, the balloons soared, the placards bounced like demented bedsprings.

Separation has been on the way for decades. To go no further back, it is seven years since Mr Parizeau came to the top of the PQ. Since then, two attempts to satisfy Quebec's constitutional demands (made by Quebec's Liberals, not the PQ) have failed--in essence, because too many of Canada's English-speakers would not wear them. In 1990, Lucien Bouchard, having left the federal cabinet, formed the Bloc Quebecois to fight elections at federal level and in October 1993 led it to a remarkable success, second only to the federal Liberals. Eleven months later it was Mr Parizeau's turn, as he swept the local Liberals out of power in Quebec.
Economics played its part in both elections. But at the root was resurgent French-speaking nationalism, helped in Mr Parizeau's case by a split among Quebec's Liberals, when some walked out to form the soft-nationalist Action Dmocratique party, now led by a 25-year-old, Mario Dumont. ""English"" Canada understood with its head, maybe, what was going on, but not with its heart. It still does not. The referendum campaign has been full of Anglo astonishment that anyone could want to part from a country that is, cliche of the season, ""the envy of the world"". When Messrs Parizeau, Bouchard and Dumont got together in June to agree on a ""soft"" referendum question--not a straight split from Canada, but one that would follow an attempt to negotiate a future partnership--federalist alarm bells should have been ringing. They were not.
Until early last month, this complacency seemed justified. The economic risks of separation looked large, even in the separatists' calculations, let alone the federalists' (the federal finance minister at one point dreamed up a million job losses for Quebec). Canada's Liberal prime minister, Jean Chretien, basically decided to let the separatists cut their own throats.
Monday's cliff-hanger showed how wrong he had been. Three weeks earlier Mr Parizeau had stepped aside to let the separatist campaign be led by the far more popular Mr Bouchard, whose charisma is such that little old Quebecoises have been seen eager just to touch the man who last winter escaped--minus a leg--from flesh-eating bacteria. From that moment the campaign, and the opinion polls, changed. Why? Because Mr Bouchard put his side's economic calculus into the cupboard and took out of it the big French drum.
He is good at lofty emotion, brilliant at rancour, Mr Bouchard. By ill chance for Canada, Mr Chretien is a French-speaker from Quebec but hated by many there for his alleged part in ancient, and some more recent, political wrong. Last week, when he belatedly addressed a television appeal to Quebeckershis privilege as prime minister--and rashly gave Mr Bouchard equal time immediately after him, the separatist tore into, not his arguments, but his treachery towards his own province and towards Rene Levesque, the separatists' great myth-figure, nearly 15 years ago. Time stops for nationalist history.
This week, having declared before the vote that he did not want any of those ""moral victories that are really defeats"", Mr Bouchard was defiant when he got just that: the fight would go on. Haling, compromise? Forget it. Even Mr Parizeau's announcement of his retirement was not that of a beaten man. I am passing on the torch, he said, in effect, to a new generation. We lost, just as Levesque lost an earlier referendum in 1980, but look how much round we've made: from 40% to almost 50%. And we won a large majority (about 60% in fact) of Quebec's French-speakers. A la prochaine (to the next time), as Levesque famously said after that earlier defeat.
Mr Parizeau lamented that the separatist cause had made no inroads among English- and other speakers. But his successor--probably Mr Bouchard--does not need to win over those who will not be won. All he needs (maybe in a fresh referendum, quite soon) is to swing another 5% of his own kind behind him. And it will be French drum and horn, and defiance of Ottawa and of le Canada anglais, that do it, not dusty economics or even jobs.
This is why some premiers of English-speaking provinces were running around this week with unusual phrases on their lips. ""We have heard you, we will work with you,"" Alberta's Ralph Klein told Quebec. It is not that these men suddenly love Quebec, they don't. Even the huge Montreal love-in on October 27th, to which non-Quebeckers poured in, some from the Pacific coast even, was not the true voice of Anglo Canada: much of it is fed to the back teeth with Quebec. But what the campaign, and the vote, have shown is that most Canadians do in fact feel for Canada, and have suddenly understood that it really could fall apart.
The provincial premiers reflect that feeling. Not perhaps as sincerely as their voters, since love of Canada is almost equalled by their desire to get Ottawa out of their provincial hair. Hence the cry on all sides for change, to keep Quebec in--for Canada's sake, not its own--and Ottawa out. But it has to be added that no one is volunteering for a third constitutional marathon, and that cries for change rang loudly after the previous Quebec referendum; producing, in the end, damn all. asdklgj;",310,Hungary,A29-4558,,False,,0,True

LIKE the Poles, the Hungarians take pride in being pioneers of democracy. Non-Slav and conscious of it, they were the aristocrats of Austria's Habsburg domain, and felt a cut above the rest under communism too. It was they who opened the Iron Curtain to let East German refugees flood into Austria and on to West Germany, precipitating German unification. So Hungarians believe the Germans, and Westem Europe, owe them a favour. What they have in mind is EU membership.
That is hard to argue with, especially since Hungary has had an economic head start on its Central European neighbours. Western business instinctively went to Hungary to invest when communism fell because it had long been the easiest place in the old eastern block to operate in. Its system was by far the most liberal, its laws half-way conducive to a market economy. There seemed to be an unspoken agreement between the communist government and the people that you could own things and make money for yourself as long as you did not get involved in politics. Hungarian life was fairly relaxed, living standards were relatively high. A quick shift to western ways came more easily to Hungary than to rigidly run Czechoslovakia next door. Hungary has attracted nearly half the $18 billion-worth of foreign investment in Central Europe since 1989, though the pace is slowing now.
Such foreign confidence gives Hungarians selfconfidence. They seem less troubled by the past than some of their neighbours, and have even found a creative use for its ogres. On wasteland on the outskirt of Budapest, towering Lenins, Marxs and local communist titans who dominated the capital's squares for half a century now stand assembled in a statue-park. Budapest folk go there for a chuckle. Almost everywhere else in the former Soviet empire, such statues have been demolished or dumped out of sight.
Unfortunately, Hungary's self-confidence no longer extends to its economy. Hungarian govemments have been happily borrowing from abroad to keep up domestic demand and underpin living standards. It could not, and did not, last. Now the country is chewing on a drastic austerity programme to bring down a perilous foreign debt and a large budget deficit.
That programme is being imposed by a postcommunist government, that of Gyula Horn, an old communist who as foreign minister allowed the Iron Curtain to be ripped open. Pushed hard by realistic adrninistrators, his finance minister and his central bank chief, Mr Horn this year has applied his shears to social welfare and wages. As in Poland, former communists are back in power, and at first seemed to be doing a job that prudent capitalists would be proud of. But Hungary's financial plight threatens to limit economic growth to around 2% this year and next-well short of the robust figures posted by its Central European rivals, particularly Poland.
Sweet reason
Still, economic performance is not everything. Hungary's political stability is holding up. The country has no problems in its relations with Germany, which appreciates the absence of prickliness. Mr Horn habitually looks glummer than he needs to. His Hungarian Socialist Party, a direct successor to the communists, controls 70% of the seats in parliament with the help of an admittedly unlikely ally, the liberal Free Democrats. He has sagely discouraged nationalist fantasies. Hungarian nationalism had enjoyed something of a revival under the centre-right government he replaced last year. Now Mr Horn tells Hungarians that notions of a ""greater Hungary"" are an illusion.
 That is just as well for his country's European aspirations. In Habsburg times Hungary was twice as big as it is now, so there are fairly large ethnic Hungarian minorities in former Hungarian lands in Slovakia (600,000) and Romania (2m). Their countrymen in Budapest still support the expatriates' political rights, prompting somewhat exaggerated charges from neighbours that Hungary is calling for its own version of ""Greater Serbia"". (Serbia is also home to a sizeable Hungarian minority, as is Ukraine.)
Hungary does support the claims of ethnic Hungarian minorities for local autonomy, but that is as far as it goes. ""It would set us back one hundred years economically,"" says Gabor Szentivanyi, a spokesman for the Hungarian foreign ministry, ""if we really wanted to make slabs of Slovakia and Romania part of Hungary again."" Moreover, a recent treaty signed with Slovakia seems a good start towards placating the EU'S worries about the troublesome Hungarian minorities. It would be even better if Slovakia were to ratify it too. The last thing the EU wants is to incorporate fresh ethnic tensions into its club. ","With a dissonant economic note

How can you tell which ex-communists and which exfascists are safe for democracy?
ONE paradox of the cold war's end is that it has brought to power, or may do, an awful lot of anti--democrats-all with popular blessing. Many of them, often lineal descendants of Stalin and (in one case) Mussolini, say they have genuinely changed their views: they now espouse freedom and democracy. Do they really? The answer is mixed.
Ex-communists have been better than ex-fascists at repackaging themselves and winning elections. In virtually every formerly communist country, they have got back into power, in various shapes, names and alliances, by winning the second postcommunist election. In the ex-Soviet Union, the only government not run at least partially by them is not-very-democratic Armenia's. In Russia itself, the Communists (no shame about the name there) may become the biggest single party in parliament after Sunday's general election. In Poland, a former communist functionary has just become president, ousting one ofthe freedomfighting heroes of the cold war, Lech Walesa.
The far right, here and there, is resurgent too-though less mightily. Jean-Marie Le Pen, of France's National Front, won as much of the vote in this summer's presidential election as the Russian Communists are expected to win on December 17th. In Italy, a smoother post-fascist, Gianfranco Fini, played a large part last year in a short-lived coalition government with the populist media-cum-retail tycoon, Silvio Berlusconiand was for a time rated by the opinion polls as Italy's most popular politician. In Austria, neo-Nazi voters may help Jorg Haider, a right-winger who says he disavows the old Nazis, to hold the balance after a general election which also takes place on December 17th. Across the ex-Soviet zone, far-right nationalists are vying with ex-communists for the vote of the growling, sullen majority who feel they have not benefited from the trauma of change.
A threat to democracy, then? It all depends on the circumstances-and the personalities. The far right in Western Europe occasionally fares well in cities with a lot of immigrants and poverty (they took a third of the vote, for instance, in Antwerp in local elections in 1994). But nationwide, in the West, it rarely surpasses the 15% mark. France may be an exception: Mr Le Pen, with that score in the presidential contest, could well win more next time: his xenophobic policies play well in times of high unemployment. Mr Fini won 13% in Italy's 1994's general election. Mr Haider won 23% in Austria's last year and is expected next week to rise still further. As with Mr Fini, it is conceivable that Mr Haider may wangle his way into a coalition (as a predecessor did with the Socialists in 1983). But nowhere does a far-right party have a chance of ruling alone. In Eastern Europe, ex-communists govern in coalition too-but usually as the dominant partner.
The real question is how fundamentally these old nasties have changed. Are they house-trained? That is to say, do they believe in democracy and human rights?
The respectability tests
The tests of whether a politician qualifies as house-trained are numerous. First, he must acknowledge that the old systems were rotten-not just because communism collapsed or Hitler's Reich and Mussolini's Italy were destroyed. Second, it requires a belief that choice and multi-party freedom are inherently beneficial, even if they mean you lose power. Third, that an independent judiciary and a separation of powers are essential. Fourth, that building a civil society means, among other things, respecting the rights of ethnic and political minorities. Fifth, that political and economic pluralism go together, and that both types fend off tyranny.
Applying such tests produces mixed results. In some places the new boss is as dictatorial and brutish as previous ones. Belarus's president, Alexander Lukashenka, is untrained. Recently he did everything he could to stop the countryvoting for a parliament, including restricting candidates' access to the state's airwaves and saying he would ignore parliament if it were elected. His attempt to hobble the election failed: on December loth, after numerous run-off elections, the country finally elected enough deputies to give parliament a quorum.
In Slovakia and Romania, the old antidemocratic bully is emerging in democratically elected leaders: Vladimir Meciar and Ion Iliescu are both roughnecks for whom opposition and minority rights are dirty words. Mr Meciar is behaving especially badly to ethnic minorities and has been trying, with contested legality, to oust the elected president. Both might be given the benefit of the doubt-but the doubt remains.
Handling of ethnic minorities is a good test. Both Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia have been democratically elected. That does not necessarily make them democrats. Both exploit virulent nationalisms which give no quarter (sometimes literally) to minorities within their, or their neighbours', midst. After recent municipal elections in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, members of Mr Tudjman's party walked out of the municipal council, leaving it without a quorum and thus preventing an opposition alliance-which won the lion's share of the vote-from taking office. House-trained? Certainly not.
What about Messrs Fini and Haider? They have disavowed fascism-though they assuredly attract votes from fascist sympathisers. Both deserve a thin benefit of the doubt. Italy and Austria-unlike, so far, the ex-Soviet Union-are rock-solid democracies. The two men's supporters are often casting protest votes, not seeking a form of dictatorship. Messrs Fini and Haider may be opportunists rather than fascists or racists. The language of Mr Le Pen suggests he needs as much house-training as they do, if not more.
Several former top operators from the communist world, such as-within the old Soviet Union-Georgia's Edward Shevardnadze and Lithuania's Algirdas Brazauskas, have undergone sincere changes of heart. The same goes for Hungary's Gyula Horn and probably for Ukraine's Leonid Kuchma, now a strong economic reformer. It may well-though it is too soon to be surebe true for Poland's new president Alexander Kwasniewski. He has just left his old party, (now the Democratic Left Alliance), the better to present himself as president of all the Poles. On economic issues, all such genuinely reformed communists are probably to the right of traditionalists in parties such as Britain's Labour Party or the French Socialists.
Indeed, economic pluralism is one bulwark of hope for a more or less democratic Russia, even if communists gain more power. If they do become the biggest party, it will be hard for them to control the huge monied and corporate interests-banks and oil companies-not to mention the splurge of smaller enterprises which have, all told, brought fully 60% of the Russian economy into private hands. Economic pluralism, now becoming entrenched, should sustain Russia's chaotic and crooked democracy.
Does that make Gennady Zyuganov, Russia's Communist leader, house-trained? Not yet. He and his party backed all the antidemocratic attempts to get rid of President Boris Yeltsin and his new regime. He shows no hint of understanding the links between pluralism, freedom and prosperity. He has been on the board of an anti-Semitic journal. But if he attained power, he would have to come to terms with a range of economic power blocks that he might not be able immediately to control. House-training is in order, then.
On the Russian right, the other group likely to do well, the Congress of Russian Communities, has no real track record. But liberal democracy is not its middle name. General Alexander Lebed, the party's star attraction, is an unsophisticated fellow. Whether he would swallow the democrats' credo whole is debatable. All that can be said for sure is that, compared with Russia's own home-grown neo-fascist polecat farther to the right, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, General Lebed is a paragon of dainty domesticated fragrance.","In elections on the same day in Russia and Austria, extremists of left and right seem certain to do well.

POOR Hungary. Its government this week lost its star performer just as the governing Socialists, the former communists, were beginning to look convincing as reformers. Fed up with bickering over his planned welfare overhaul, Lajos Bokros, the finance minister, resigned after nearly exchanging blows with a trade union leader at a stormy cabinet meeting.
Under the guidance of Mr Bokros, a 4r year-old former banker, and his close friend, Gyorgy Suranyi, the central bank governor, the Socialist-Liberal coalition, which got off to a wobbly start nearly two years ago, has just given Hungary a full year of much-needed austerity. Indeed, Mr Bokros was exulting in the brutal radicalism of his measures only last week, when he toured West European countries to assure Hungary's creditors that he had put Hungary on the right track.
His message was convincing. The emergency stabilisation package which he and Mr Suranyi had put together led to big spending cuts and had cut the budget deficit to around 5% of GDP. Hungary's burgeoning trade and current account deficits have been stemmed, thanks to a devaluation of the forint by 28%o over the past year and to the introduction of an import surcharge.
Hungary's exports, counted in dollars, have jumped by 21.5% over the past year. The trade deficit has narrowed sharply. In spite of steep rises in energy prices, inflation has been contained, mainly because Mr Bokros managed to slash real wages by 10.5%. He had promised to claw inflation down this year from 28% to 20%. ""Very tough, very unpopular, but very long-term,"" he was explaining gleefully last week.
Hungary's recent privatisation record has been impressive, too. The government had managed to sell stakes in most of the country's electricity and gas utilities, the national telecoms company and a large bank, all in a matter of weeks at the end of last year. This helped bring in a record $5 billion in foreign investment last year-equivalent to around 12% of last year's GD1 much of which will be used to pay off Hungary's $32 billion gross foreign debt, still the highest per capita in the former eastern block, and still a big albatross around the country's neck.
The markets have shown their pleasure, with share prices on the fledgling Budapest stock exchange surging by a third in the first six weeks of this year, mainly on foreign buying. And the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which embraces the world's most advanced economies, said it would admit Hungary later this year-an important step, in Hungarian eyes, towards membership of the European Union.
So Mr Bokros, a lot worse at politics than he is at economics, was a victim of his own success. Gyula Horn, Hungary's wily prime minister, and once a liberal communist foreign minister, had several times persuaded Mr Bokros to stay on, no doubt because the country's creditors were likely to be much kinder with a robust minister in charge of Hungary's finances.

 POOR Hungary . Its government this week lost its star performer just as the governing Socialists , the former communists , were beginning to look convincing as reformers . Fed up with bickering over his planned welfare overhaul , Lajos Bokros , the finance minister , resigned after nearly exchanging blows with a trade union leader at a stormy cabinet meeting . 
 Under the guidance of Mr Bokros , a 4r year - old former banker , and his close friend , Gyorgy Suranyi , the central bank governor , the Socialist - Liberal coalition , which got off to a wobbly start nearly two years ago , has just given Hungary a full year of much - needed austerity . Indeed , Mr Bokros was exulting in the brutal radicalism of his measures only last week , when he toured West European countries to assure Hungary 's creditors that he had put Hungary on the right track . 
 His message was convincing . The emergency stabilisation package which he and Mr Suranyi had put together led to big spending cuts and had cut the budget deficit to around 5 % of GDP . Hungary 's burgeoning trade and current account deficits have been stemmed , thanks to a devaluation of the forint by 28%o over the past year and to the introduction of an import surcharge . 
 Hungary 's exports , counted in dollars , have jumped by 21.5 % over the past year . The trade deficit has narrowed sharply . In spite of steep rises in energy prices , inflation has been contained , mainly because Mr Bokros managed to slash real wages by 10.5 % . He had promised to claw inflation down this year from 28 % to 20 % . "" Very tough , very unpopular , but very long - term , "" he was explaining gleefully last week . 
 Hungary 's recent privatisation record has been impressive , too . The government had managed to sell stakes in most of the country 's electricity and gas utilities , the national telecoms company and a large bank , all in a matter of weeks at the end of last year . This helped bring in a record $ 5 billion in foreign investment last year - equivalent to around 12 % of last year 's GD1 much of which will be used to pay off Hungary 's $ 32 billion gross foreign debt , still the highest per capita in the former eastern block , and still a big albatross around the country 's neck . 
 The markets have shown their pleasure , with share prices on the fledgling Budapest stock exchange surging by a third in the first six weeks of this year , mainly on foreign buying . And the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development , which embraces the world 's most advanced economies , said it would admit Hungary later this year - an important step , in Hungarian eyes , towards membership of the European Union . 
 So Mr Bokros , a lot worse at politics than he is at economics , was a victim of his own success . Gyula Horn's had several times persuaded Mr Bokros to stay on , no doubt because the country 's creditors were likely to be much kinder with a robust minister in charge of Hungary 's finances . 
 Flushed with the speed of the recent economic turnaround , Gyula Horn and others in the Socialist party whose popular support has slumped in the past year , though they need not face a general election until 1998 - may now be tempted to slow the pace of reform . That would be most unwise .

French ones, with their light, thin horns and bassoons, used to have a sound as strong and airy as the Eiffel Tower. Strings in Central Europe had the colour and touch of Habsburg-plush. German orchestras with their granite discipline got burgomasterly weight from the doublebasses. American ones had a brassy directness, in New York, an aggressiveness even.
That was then. Now Andras Schiff, a pianist who has played with most of the world's famous orchestras, reckons he can recognise only the Vienna Philharmonic. He is not the only musician worried by a creeping internationalism in classical music. Leonard Slatkin, an American conductor, was asked recently by the Czech Philharmonic brass to show them how to play like the Chicago Symphony's. He replied: ""if I wanted that sound, I'd go to Chicago.""
A distinct orchestral style starts with the instruments themselves. Smaller brass mouthpieces common in Germany and America helped create a brighter, more direct sound than the fat ""thwomp"" heard in Britain or Eastern Europe. French double-bass bows weigh less than their German counterparts. Held from below rather than above, they strike with less force. Their lighter sound is still valued in France, unlike the French bassoon: its reedy, subtle voice was eventually swamped out of use by ever-denser string tone. Even the Orchestre de Paris dumped its bassoons in favour of the bolder German fagott-type of bassoon in the 1970s.
By then, mechanical progress had already seen off the nasally Gallic rotaryvalve French horn. For the wind instruments, ever improving products have combined with international distribution to ""level up"" instrumental quality. But the global market is having a disturbingly opposite effect in the strings. The lush warmth of Central and Eastern Europeans' string technique is being undermined by the scarcity of great instruments, many of which have ""defected"" westwards, with or without star owners.
Teaching traditions have also contributed to orchestral personality. The mellow expressiveness of Czech wind playing developed over zoo years in which every small town had its marching band and technique was passed from parent to child. In Vienna, the Philharmonic's players have for a century and a half taught their successors, passing on their unique plasticity and vividness of phrasing. (You will not find haughtier collective pride among musicians anywhere: when asked once what a guest conductor would be playing that evening, the Vienna Philharmonic's leader shot back, ""I've no idea, but we'll be playing Mozart's 40th.') Continuity and tradition like that are less marked elsewhere, though audible in Dresden, and Philadelphia, where orchestral players teach at the renowned Curtis Institute.
But teaching is no longer a local affair. When an American cellist, Lynn Harrell, did a recent stint as head of London's Royal Academy of Music, its strings and especially its cellos were heard to develop a more muscular American manner. Teaching exchanges are increasing. Academy students have year-out options in Germany and Scandinavia, and the Paris Conservatoire now swaps its pedagogic strengths with London's Guildhall school. British students learn some Parisian solo flair; French players gain some ensemble discipline.
A teaching brain drain is already affecting the standards reached by Russia's instrumental students. In the West, job prospects for even a brilliant young player are insecure. Portmanteau careers, perhaps involving studio work on advertising jingles alongside work in conventional orchestras and period instrument banks, demand a variety of skills. Highly developed local or national character is an early casualty. Conservatoires are training for international opportunities.
Even the recording industry is helping to dismantle the national styles, which might otherwise provide some musical justification for their endless duplication of repertoire. Students and professionals can now pick and choose their influences on CD. Guildhall youngsters, no less than the Czech brass, aspire to a seat in Chicago.
There is no reason why an orchestra resembling the United Nations should not develop a powerful individuality. The great American orchestras were all forged in the melting pot Their founders went to Europe for their players: to France and Belgium for woodwind; to Germany for brass; to Holland for cellists and to Austro-Hungary for fiddlers. Yet Boston, Chicago and Cleveland all created their own voice, while the ""Philadelphia Sound"" became a catchphrase .
The secret lay in their conductors. Leopold Stokowski, part English, part American, was obsessed by sound quality. He once sent his Philadelphia trumpeter to the machine shop for a radically designed mouthpiece to play just one note. He encouraged his woodwinds to dispense with orthodox breathing, allowed violinists to bow out of synchronisation (which may be what produced their velvet sheen in legato passages), and endlessly tried out new seating plans to alter the relation of the sounds. He was followed by a Hungarian violinist, Eugene Ormandy, who according to his string players insisted they dig in and play harder than anyone else. ""The Philadelphia Sound-it's me"", Ormandy used to say.
Crucially, these two men ran the orchestra for over 60 years, and in both cases conductor and orchestra made music almost exclusively together. No modern-day conductor has such a relationship with their band: in the last 30 years the only comparable regime was the late Herbert von Karajan's in Berlin. Even Sir Simon Rattle has now decided to loosen the 15-year partnership which made him and the Birmingham orchestra famous.
The future of orchestral character in these jet-setting times lies with orchestras. Mr Slatkin's recipe for a more local orchestral sound includes putting more local music into the repertoire. That sounds right. But such a strategy is really only marketable in German-speaking countries-if there. The Vienna Philharmonic is often criticised for its narrow, museum repertoire. But in general orchestras which care about their musical personality the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonics, or London's Symphony Orchestra and Philharmonia are obvious examples-take pains to hire only players who fit in. Brilliant auditionees fall at a later hurdle: they are asked to play an extended trial period in the orchestra, under scrutiny of their prospective colleagues. The trial system is increasingly being adopted in America.
Perhaps the most encouraging sign of pawky individuality is in France.

THE tracts of America reserved for Indians often provide some of the most dismal statistics in the country. Half of all Indians live below the poverty line, 40% of them in housing that, according to a Senate report, is ""overcrowded or physically deficient."" About 40% of the adult Indians on America's 300 reservations are out of work. Alcoholism and suicide are way above the national averages. Many reservations seem mired in a spiritual indifference made all the worse by geographical remoteness.
Is it the government's fault? In the beginning, undoubtedly, and in some ways the neglect continues; but the trouble is not lack of spending. In today's dollars, appropriations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BiA) have decreased by $20m a year since 1976, and Congress wants to slice the bureau's 1996 budget by another 17%.Yet overall spending on Indians, including sources other than the BIA, has doubled from $3 billion in 1985 to $6 billion in 1995. With some result: suicides have dropped by 25% since 1973, and alcohol-related deaths have been cut by a third in the past 15 years.
But the money from Washington also encourages Indian tribes, which rank as sovereign nations, to rely too heavily on the federal government. Why do some tribes succeed and others fail? The vital requirement is to keep the BIA at arm's length. Joseph Kalt of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government makes no bones about this: ""The fate of the BiA rises and falls with the fate of Indian country. You can actually go and see the data. The higher the unemployment rate, the worse the poverty, the better off the BIA; its budget rises, its staff rises, its power rises."" The result is a demoralising spiral of co-dependency.
 It also helps to have a tribal government that fosters initiative and insulates the tribe from petty politics. This is especially true on isolated reservations that rely on income from natural resources. Some of the poorest tribes abouned`l in natural wealth, such as minerals and coal. In contrast, some of the most prosperous have little but their wits to live on.
The Mashantucket Pequot tribe of Connecticut watches the bottom line. This tiny tribe of 350 has made billions from gambling, a business in which Indian tribes have long been allowed special leeway (see box). The Mashantuckets are now nearly independent of the federal government, receiving only $100,000 in federal cash last year. They run Foxwoods Resort, said to be one of the most successful casinos in the world, with revenue estimated at nearly $i billion a year. The tribe is governed by a seven-member council, with each member serving a three-year term. Although every member of the tribe is guaranteed housing and education, there is no automatic sharing-out of cash. Money is distributed purely on an incentive basis, with points awarded for going to college or for taking part in tribal government
The Mashantuckets are unusual. Midway between Boston and New York, they have access to a market of 22m casinocrazed customers. Most tribes are not so lucky; isolation is one of the biggest obstacles to self-sufficiency. Yet the Mississippi Choctaws have leapt this hurdle handily. With a wiring-harness assembly business and a greeting-card and general printing plant on their 22,000 acre reservation, the tribe had $loom in sales last year.
As among the Mashantuckets, the Choctaws' system of government has helped. The tribe has an elected i6-member council and, above that, something more indigenous-a strong man, Philip Martin. Mr Martin, the tribe's chief executive, likes sovereignty but is no isolationist: he consults non-tribal experts and puts their advice to work. When the tribe's assembly plant needed upgrading he hired a plant supervisor from General Motors to help, and organised a BIA loan guarantee to cover costs.
The Choctaws, like every other tribe, struggle with factionalism, but they seem able to settle their differences peaceably The tribe argued fiercely in 1990 over whether to install a hazardous-waste site on the reservation. Many, including Mr Martin, thought it might serve the tribe well. Unable to resolve the problem through the tribal council or the wisdom of a chief, the tribe held a referendum. Result: no hazardous-waste site for the Choctaws.
Pluralism, Indian-style, takes yet another form among the Cochiti Pueblo Indians of New Mexico. Once a year, a tribal holy man called a caseeca hand-picks the tribal government. These ten men run the tribe for the next year. It may be undemocratic, but the Cochitis do not complain. They lease out a part of the desert owned by the tribe for a retirement community centred round a pool and a golf course; they have the fastest-growing incomes of any tribe in the United States.
At the opposite end of the spectrum are the Crows, whose 2.3m-acre reservation in southern Montana sits on a treasure trove of natural resources, including an estimated $26 billion in coal. Potentially, this is one of the wealthiest native tribes in the world. But the Crows are poor, with 72% unemployment. The tribe has a general-council form of government It has 10,000 members; everybody over 18 qualifies automatically. Although this type of government provides the Indian world with its purest form of democracy, it is clearly chaotic and an obstacle to change.
Any form of supervision by the tribal government, it seems, has a bad effect on land and agricultural production. Indians used to have generous notions about common property, but it is quite wrong to suppose that the concept of private property was foreign to them. White settlers who assumed that a Blackfoot's prized buffalo horse belonged to anyone wanting it were briskly disabused of the notion, as were those who barged in on the beaver-trapping territory of the Northern Ojibwas.
Most reservations contain three types of land: property held in joint trust by the BIA and the tribe; land operated by a tribal member, but held in trust by the BIA; and land owned outright by an individual member. Terry Anderson, an economist at Montana State University, has shown that reservations' agricultural output per acre is 85% higher on private land than on land held in trust by the tribes or the BIA.
The tribes set great store on being sovereign nations. Yet, as Harvard's Mr Kalt points out, it is more important to hold tribes and individuals responsible for their own affairs. Those tribes that pin their hopes on more federal dollars and lawsuits over lost land will still be poor after the money and title arrive. The key to economic development, as a Nobel-winning economist, Paul Samuelson, has said, is not resources, but effective self-government.","BIG HORN, WYOMING

AN UNCIVIL war is starting in the world of animals and people are having to take sides. In one camp are those who believe that more legal protection is needed to the save the world's wildlife; they include fund-raising conservationists in the West, their allies in the media, and government officials almost everywhere. In the other camp are those who believe that greater protection is doomed to fail because it pits wildlife against indigenous people all over the world-be they Masai tribesmen, gamekeepers in Scotland or ranchers in Montana resisting the reintroduction of the wolf The only hope, prohunters maintain, is to allow exploitation, so giving people an incentive to tolerate wild animals in their neighbourhood.
The debate is full of irony, not to say hypocrisy. In many countries, belief in free markets is spreading and confidence in government declining. Wildlife policy, by contrast is commonly moving in the opposite direction-towards stricter regulation. As western animal lovers let their heartstrings and wallets be plucked on behalf of endangered elephants, southern African ecologists are saying that in many places there are too many elephants. Old colonial right-wing whites embrace the cause of native blacks. Left-wing western whites stand accused of neo-imperialism on behalf of wild animals.
In central Asia, as in the Zambezi valley, wildlife is suddenly extremely valuable for its ability to draw well-heeled hunters from the West. The fee to kill a Marco Polo sheep in the high Pamirs now runs to more than $20,000. In Scotland, Britain's Conservative government has, in effect, nationalised the red deer and increased the powers of an agency (the Red Deer Commission) to cull them using helicopters. In the Rockies, the biodiversity of Yellowstone National Park steadily disintegrates as elk numbers climb unchecked. In India the tiger reserves are under great pressure from land-hungry people who object to being eaten.
Should people manage wildlife? If so, should governments or private landowners do so? When conservation first became a priority in the middle third of the century, governments responded similarly all over the world by segregating humans from animals. They set aside publicly owned areas for game, drove out the indigenous people and passed laws protecting some species altogether. People and animals were to live in separate homelands. The policy was pursued most vigorously in Africa, where more than 48m hectares (120m acres) have been set aside for wildlife, a higher proportion than in other continents.
The flaws in this were soon apparent. The protected species were resented by local people, especially if they were dangerous (tigers in India) or fond of eating people's livelihoods (hippos in Africa; hen harriers in Scotland). Farmers whose mealies (maize) was destroyed by it viewed the elephant as a six-tonne cockroach. The protected areas, belonging to nobody, attracted corrupt profit-seekers. They also of ten proved too small to be ecologically viable. And the wildlife outside the parkswhich is most of it in most countries-was left with no means of paying its way.
In Africa, where the row between the conserve-wildlife and the exploit-wildlife lobbies rages loudest, there is a startling contrast between the south and the east of the continent. East African countries, led by Kenya, rapidly nationalised their game. By 1976 they had, by and large, banned all hunting. Predictably, a corrupt free-for-all in ivory poaching soon developed, with a widespread but unproven suspicion that the profiteers included high-ups in the government. In 1989, with the charismatic Richard Leakey at their head, Kenyans led a fight to ban the international trade in ivory so as to save their rapidly declining and heavily poached elephant population.
Another tack
Southern African countries, led by Zimbabwe, took the opposite route. In 1975 Zimbabwe privatised wildlife, granting effective title to the landowner, though rearguard action by bureaucrats prevented this policy from coming fully into effect until the late i98os. In1989, led by Rowan Martin, Zimbabweans opened the fight against a trade ban on ivory, arguing that their elephant numbers were increasing to problem levels and destroying the cover essential for bush buck and other forest animals. The Zimbabweans further argued that profits from ivory and hide provided the best way to reconcile farmers with their damaging and dangerous pachyderm neighbours. The controlled trade in ivory was working relatively well in a relatively uncorrupt country.
Both Mr Leakey and Mr Martin have since lost their jobs and been accused of corruption, though few doubt their innocence. Mr Leakey won the trade ban, but many now think Mr Martin won the argument: Mr Leakey's successor, David Western, is trying to re-establish legal hunting in Kenya. Elephant poaching did fall immediately after the trade ban, but mainly because of a sudden and massive flow of aid money from the West to enforce antipoaching measures. Since then, poaching has been increasing again, and even the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) doubts that the ban has been responsible for a permanent decline in poaching.
The rhino precedent is not encouraging. Trade in rhino horn, which is used mainly to make medicines in East Asia and dagger handles for rich Arab youngbloods, has continued despite nine years of official banning under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES Since one-third of doctors in South Korea believe there is no substitute for the horn as medicine, they are unlikely to persuade their patients to give up a remedy for their sick children in order to conserve a distant African animal.
An imprecision
The parallels between elephant ivory and rhino horn are not exact: there are far fewer rhinos and they bring poachers far bigger rewards than do elephants. But they are close enough for many conservationists to have second thoughts about the current strategy for saving the rhino. This consists in trying to suppress poaching mainly in Africa, trying to stamp out the trade and trying to suppress demand in the consumer countries of Yemen, China and points east. It is not working. Black rhinos have declined from 12,753 in 1981 to 2,550 in 1993; white rhinos have increased from 3,561 to 6,784 but mainly in heavily guarded South African national parks.
As poaching increases, with automatic weapons widespread in nearby Mozambique and the South African government pressed by other priorities, nobody is especially hopeful for the white rhinos in South Africa's Kruger National Park. A Mozambican poacher can octuple his average annual income with one kilogram of rhino horn. When it reaches China that kilogram may be loo times as valuable, at up to $18,000. The incentives driving the trade are huge.
In a book from the Institute of Economic Affairs, ""Rhinos: Conservation, Economics and Trade-Offs"" (1995), Michael 't Sas-Rolfes suggests a different strategy: legalise the trade again, auction some of the existing stockpiles of horn (many of which are derived from dehorning programmes), use the proceeds to pay for intensive protection measures for wild rhinos and rapidly build up the ranched population of privately owned rhinos whose horns can be painlessly cut off every few years for sale; and so in this way gradually drive down the price for horn (removing the incentive for poachers to take wild animals) and provide a steady income to protect the wild stock.
If this bold strategy is adopted, according to Mr 't Sas-Rolfes, the winners will be the countries that have rhinos, the consumers of rhino products, conservation agencies and their donors, taxpayers who pay for anti-poacher patrols-and rhinos themselves. The losers will be criminals, bureaucrats, politicians and environmental groups. Nearly everybody involved in wildlife in Zimbabwe believes that safari hunting is good for wildlife, and the facts bear them out. Since the partial privatisation of game in 1975, the area of private land devoted to wildlife in the country has almost doubled. Hunting brings money. To spend three weeks in the Zimbabwean or Tanzanian bush killing a lion, an elephant, a leopard and various antelopes will cost you nearly $50,000-not including air fares. For this sort of return a hunter, in a tent, leaves a smaller imprint on the landscape than thousands of tourists in minibuses. When Africans could sell furs, tusks and hides for good money they had less need to get the killing done by foreign rednecks. Now the most auctionable part of an elephant or a leopard is its death.
For most of Africa, in fact, the choice is less between hunters and tourists than between hunters and farming. For farming is not compatible with African elephants, Cape buffalo or lions. If Africa is to keep wild land, then it must pay its way in competition with cattle ranching. To do so, says David Cumming of the WWF in Harare, landowners need a ""full range of options"": hunting for meat and hides, sport hunting for fees, and photographic tourism. For an environmentalist, Mr Cumming is refresh ingly candid about the need for blood to be spilled. There are no strong feelings against safari hunting in Africa, according to him. Only in Britain and America do people mistake animal welfare for conservation, he says, and to force western values on Africa is cultural imperialism.
Conservation bwanas
If you give money to the WWF, at least it ends up in pragmatic hands in Africa. New, more radical organisations such as the Environmental Investigation Agency or the United States Humane Society are now big enough to buy considerable influence in Africa. Their dogmatic approach-that all killing is bad for wildlife-is widely resented by those who care about the welfare of the indigenous people.
If the dogmatism of the preservationists is unattractive, so too is the attitude of many hunters, who care little for their targets, let alone for the people in whose countries they hunt. Many tourists want a wilderness experience without a kill. They are increasingly prepared to pay well to be alone, or on foot, with wild animals rather than to watch lions from a queue of minibuses: to hunt with a camera. In the more scenic areas, hunting is already giving way to exclusive, ""non-consumptive"" tourism.
The reason is simple enough. However well hunting pays, it cannot compete with tourism-in those few, special localities where tourists can be persuaded to come. Cattle ranching and game ranching both produce roughly about $5 a hectare Sport hunting can double that yield to $l0 a hectare. Exclusive tourism can raise that to $50 a hectare. And mass tourism, Serengetistyle, can double it again to $t100 a hectare. Each tourist pays less than a hunter would pay, but the tourists make up for it in numbers. For obvious reasons, only a few hunters can be accommodated at any one time. Hunting preserves-which require minimal capital investment-are an intermediate stage. They will gradually evolve into private national parks.
Everybody in conservation wants as much land as possible kept wild. But dogmatic preservationists would achieve that aim entirely through regulation and public subsidy. Pragmatists would pursue it also through the market by providing real incentives for local people to prosper from wildlife. And those incentives would help the wildlife prosper too. ","For many, conservation seems a simple matter: stop killing wildlife. Those on the ground are coming to almost the opposite conclusion
AN UNCIVIL war is starting in the world of animals and people are having to take sides. In one camp are those who believe that more legal protection is needed to the save the world's wildlife; they include fund-raising conservationists in the West, their allies in the media, and government officials almost everywhere. In the other camp are those who believe that greater protection is doomed to fail because it pits wildlife against indigenous people all over the world-be they Masai tribesmen, gamekeepers in Scotland or ranchers in Montana resisting the reintroduction of the wolf The only hope, prohunters maintain, is to allow exploitation, so giving people an incentive to tolerate wild animals in their neighbourhood.
The debate is full of irony, not to say hypocrisy. In many countries, belief in free markets is spreading and confidence in government declining. Wildlife policy, by contrast is commonly moving in the opposite direction-towards stricter regulation. As western animal lovers let their heartstrings and wallets be plucked on behalf of endangered elephants, southern African ecologists are saying that in many places there are too many elephants. Old colonial right-wing whites embrace the cause of native blacks. Left-wing western whites stand accused of neo-imperialism on behalf of wild animals.
In central Asia, as in the Zambezi valley, wildlife is suddenly extremely valuable for its ability to draw well-heeled hunters from the West. The fee to kill a Marco Polo sheep in the high Pamirs now runs to more than $20,000. In Scotland, Britain's Conservative government has, in effect, nationalised the red deer and increased the powers of an agency (the Red Deer Commission) to cull them using helicopters. In the Rockies, the biodiversity of Yellowstone National Park steadily disintegrates as elk numbers climb unchecked. In India the tiger reserves are under great pressure from land-hungry people who object to being eaten.
Should people manage wildlife? If so, should governments or private landowners do so? When conservation first became a priority in the middle third of the century, governments responded similarly all over the world by segregating humans from animals. They set aside publicly owned areas for game, drove out the indigenous people and passed laws protecting some species altogether. People and animals were to live in separate homelands. The policy was pursued most vigorously in Africa, where more than 48m hectares (120m acres) have been set aside for wildlife, a higher proportion than in other continents.
The flaws in this were soon apparent. The protected species were resented by local people, especially if they were dangerous (tigers in India) or fond of eating people's livelihoods (hippos in Africa; hen harriers in Scotland). Farmers whose mealies (maize) was destroyed by it viewed the elephant as a six-tonne cockroach. The protected areas, belonging to nobody, attracted corrupt profit-seekers. They also of ten proved too small to be ecologically viable. And the wildlife outside the parkswhich is most of it in most countries-was left with no means of paying its way.

THE luxury end of the hi-fi market caters for a few music-lovers willing to spend several thousand dollars on an audio system. It chalks up sales of less than $1billion a year. That is puny next to America's $70 billion consumer-electronics business. But many products that are now standard, including the Dolby noisereduction system and compact discs, started life as the costly playthings of hi-fi fanatics. Will their latest craze-amplifiers that use ancient vacuum-tube (or valve) technology-follow?
Amplifiers powered by glowing glass tubes have apparently been heading for extinction ever since the invention of the smaller, cheaper transistor in 1948. In 1990, their sales were next to nothing. Now they account for around half of all upmarket hi-fi amplifiers sold in America. The reason? Hi-fi fanatics claim that the tubes reproduce musical notes more accurately. Cognoscenti say that listening to tubes is akin to driving a vintage Bentley; the transistor is more like a modern luxury car.
Even stranger, the most sought-after tube products are socalled ""single-ended"" amplifiers: low-powered throwbacks that reproduce music using a single ""triode"", the ancient tube design that, in 1906, first made amplification possible. As such devices produce only a few watts of power, they work best with the ancient but efficient ""horn"" loudspeakers of 1950s cinemas. So horns are also making a comeback.
At present the tube-amplifier business is dominated by specialist firms such as Audio Research, Conrad-Johnson Design and Cary Audio Design, all from America; France's Jadis; and Japan's Audio Note. None of their products is for the financially challenged. Audio Note, a pioneer of the single-ended market in hi-fimad Japan, sells amplifiers that range from $1,700 to $252,500 for its Gaku-On flagship (of which it has sold ten during the past year in America). As for horn speakers, Jadis's Eurythmie II costs $37,000 a pair; Profile Trio speakers, made by Germany's Avantgarde Acoustic, sell for $40,000.
Recently, the lure of fat margins has tempted bigger players into the market. Marantz, a mass-market consumer-electronics firm 51% owned by Philips, a Dutch electronics giant, has just launched a tube amplifier costing $50,000. It has also reissued, for up to $8,400 apiece, a range of tube amplifiers that it first sold in the 1950s. Most of these amplifiers' components are manufactured by the suppliers that made the originals. Mesa Engineering, a famed Californian maker of guitar amplifiers, has also now entered the hi-fi market, with a $3,400 amplifier.
AT&T's old Western Electric brand is also being revived. Lucent Technologies, one of the three firms to emerge out of the latest break-up of AT&T, has licensed the name to Westrex, a small Atlanta firm which is resuming production of Western Electric's 300B triode-a device first sold in 1938 that is now legendary in hi-fi circles. Charles Whitener, president of Westrex, hopes to sell 30,000 of its $350 triodes a year; that would give the firm 40% of a market currently dominated by Chinese and East European tube makers.

Yet your suggestion that the defining element of a great power has now shifted ""from the battlefield to the marketplace"", although substantially correct and innovative, represents only part of the existing strategic reality. Although it remains undeniable that without economic prosperity no country can claim superpower status forever, it is equally true that the availability of nuclear weapons provides an enduring force-multiplier which transcends mere economic comparisons. The West feared Moscow for decades because the Kremlin's military intentions were expansionary or, at very best, unpredictable; it no longer fears Russia precisely because these elements have largely been dispelled. Sadly, those Russian politicians who rally against what they perceive as Boris Yeltsin's slavish cooperation with the West may have a point: in the absence of economic revival, the maintenance of a level of unpredictability about Russia's future behaviour may force western governments to listen more, rather than less, to Moscow's wishes. 
After the collapse of communism the Russians were told to stop selling weapons, only to see western arms exports soar. They were also asked to support the Gulf war and western policy in Yugoslavia, but subsequently were excluded from the management of both conflicts. The West genuinely wants to treat Russia as a great power but pretends that this carries no strategic price. Almost regardless of who is elected president this summer, the main question is not whether Russia will remain cooperative but, rather, whether Russian interests can be made to coincide with those of the West Pretending that such differences do not exist is part of the current problem, and it may well be that only by becoming embroiled in a new mischief-making policy will Moscow ultimately realise both the inherently flawed basis of its power and the limits of western tolerance.

Tuned in 
SIR-I disagree with your leader ""Switch it off' (April 13th). I do not consider public broadcasting a subsidy. According to my dictionary, a subsidy is a ""grant of money from government to a private enterprise considered beneficial to the public."" This is clearly not the case with public broadcasting. 
Radio and television broadcasting are state services just like roads, trains and water. By this logic, providing roads and water to sparse rural areas is not subsidising the citizenry but a state obligation. 
If state-financed public television did not exist, who would produce and air unprofitable but necessary programmes? This has nothing to do with spectrum scarcity; rather, it concerns the concept that the airwaves belong to the community and that noncommercial programmes should also be produced. In America, for example, public radio is the only place where one can really get information. 
If, on the other hand, by ""subsidy"" you refer to the fact that some public broadcasters are also financed by advertising, and are therefore subsidised by the private sector, I agree with you that such subsidy should be eliminated. 
The anomaly, in this case, is that public broadcasting should not run commercials, but should be solely financed by the state. 
DOM SERAFINI Editor Video Age International New York 
Defeating poaching 
SIR-Your suggestion that the ivory trade ban has not worked is absurd (""Killing to be kind"", April 20th). Yes, poaching has increased in a few countries in the past two years, but the numbers are insignificant compared with the 70,000-100,000 elephants poached annually prior to the ban. In the 1980s Zimbabwe was responsible for the poaching of elephants and rhinos by its army in Mozambique and parts of its own country-it is absolutely wrong to say it had ivory trade under control. Western aid ""to enforce anti-poaching"" never materialised for most central and west African countries and yet poaching decreased substantially. And it is ridiculous to quote the rapid decline in rhinos since 1981 as a testament to the failure of trade bans when it was only in 1993 that any serious attempt was made to enforce the law in consuming countries. 
Following American trade sanctions against Taiwan, new legislation in China and other countries (all since 1993), the rhino population is now described as stable in Africa for the first time in 25 years.There is a lot more to be done, but at least let us begin by getting the facts correct. 
I was astonished to read that the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) believes ""that all killing is bad for wildlife"". That has never been the EIA'S policy. We acknowledge the few small programmes where local communities can benefit from hunting. The EIA opposes, along with the vast majority of African states, the international trade in ivory and rhino horn. That is an entirely pragmatic approach to conservation. 
DAVE CURREY Director London EIA 
The IMF replies 
SIR-Kevin Watkins's letter (April 27th) misses the mark. 
First, the supposed ""disastrous performance of IMF programmes"" is pure invention. Under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF), established in 1987 to provide concessional assistance to low-income countries, many African countries have undertaken reforms and improved their prospects for sustainable economic growth. In 1995 African countries achieved positive income growth per head for the first time since 1989. For 1996-97 the IMF projects the region's real economic growth to accelerate to about 5% annually, a rate that is higher than the projected growth of world output. 
Second, in arguing for ""debtreduction now"", Mr Watkins overlooks the responsibility of donor governments to make sure that taxpayers' money is put to good use. He also ignores the serious inequities, not to say moral hazard, that would result from severing the link between a good track record of policy reform and eligibility for exceptional assistance. The international community is surely right in encouraging the African countries concerned to extend their track records under ESAF-supported programmes in order to benefit from exceptional debt relief, in which all creditors, including the IMF, would shoulder their fair share. Given the difficulties of generating development assistance, the agitation for a ""bold"" initiative to reduce the debt of the highly indebted poor countries is understandable. But we now know that the international community has no appetite for a quick fix. Oxfam and other nongovernmental organisations should henceforth throw their weight behind a self-sustained ESAF.

Into training 
SIR-Success is possible in job training so long as policymakers look beyond their immediate goal of job placement to the root of its difficulty: lack of job skills and basic education (""What works?"", April 6th). 
Such examples do exist. A programme in New York city has found this approach successful even with homeless mothersthe youngest, poorest and least educated of the welfare population. The Train and Gain programme integrates literacy and basic education with on-the-job training and independent living skills. As a result,70 graduates formerly dependent on public assistance have found and retained employment in the past 19 months, and another 13 have moved on to higher education. 
A booming economy will do nothing for employment if potential workers are unable to read, much less type. Only an approach seeking solutions to both economic instability and the monumental needs of today's unemployed will enable nations to greet the 21st century with enough jobs for the workforce, and a workforce prepared for the jobs. 
RALPH DA COSTA NUNEZ Institute for Children and Poverty New York 
SIR-Your article on training and jobs argues that we ought not to ""expect too much"" of basic literacy and numeracy programmes for the long-term unemployed because those who have not acquired such skills ""may be beyond help of this sort"". Clever economic incentives could help. For instance, requiring a simple test of literacy and numeracy at the point of benefit application would quickly identify the illiterate.A marginal decline in benefit levels could be enacted until the applicants showed they had acquired the skills. This would provide a powerful economic incentive to acquire these vital workforce skills. Exceptions could be allowed for those who manifest learning disabilities. 
Charlottesville, Virginia THOMAS O'BRIEN 
SIR-I am not at all surprised to read that training is not the magic bullet for unemployment that most politicians would like to believe it is. 
As a former long-term member of the unemployed, and now a university undergraduate, with a long and tangled relationship with both the benefit and the training/tertiary education sectors, I knew that ages ago. But, as a member of the ""target group"", I doubt that I would have been heard, let alone listened to with any sort of respect. 
The only training schemes that I am aware of that actually make an appropriate return on the investment of time and effort by the unemployed themselves happen to be the ones that the businesses concerned (eg, electronics, clothes manufacturing) actually get involved with.

SIR-In your article ""Stormy weather ahead"" (March 23rd) you attempt to summarise the debate regarding a future humaninduced change of climate. A balanced review of the issue can hardly be given, however, without a more thorough consideration of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment Report (SAR). 
There is a lively, constructive debate in leading scientific journals on a number of key issues that have arisen in the light of research on climate change, but few contributors question the main findings of the IPCC. Further, there is an explicit requirement imposed by the IPCC on the lead authors charged with producing the climate assessment, to ""clearly identify disparities of views for which there is significant scientific or technical support together with the relevant arguments"". There is thus no IPCC demand for forced consensus as some critics of the IPCC process suggest. 
Regarding the possible role of variations of incoming solar radiation in explaining past changes, the IPCC reports in 1994 and 1995 have analysed this in detail and concluded that although such variations probably play some role, their effects will be much smaller than those due to the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gases. We do not yet know how serious a global climate change might be, but it is clear that changes due to human interference with the climate system are now emerging out of ""the noise"" of natural climate variability and they may be a serious threat. 
There is no controversy about the long time (a century or perhaps more) it would take before a major enhancement of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (eg, doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations) would have again declined to or below present levels. We cannot stop the rapid increase of carbon dioxide concentrate quickly, since society can change its energy supply only slowly if big economic disruptions are to be avoided. The SAR represents an attempt by (a very large part of) the scientific community to present an assessment that is not influenced by, on the one hand, those who maintain that climate change is no serious threat to the global society and, on the other, those, particularly environmental activists, who call for immediate and far-reaching measures in order to avoid a catastrophe. I hope that the Ipcc report will be more thoroughly analysed with this objective clearly in mind.

SIR-Your article ""The withering away of the state"" (April 6th) notes that ""The three decades after the second world war saw the biggest increase in public spending, mainly reflecting the expansion of the welfare state."" 
I have not done the work to establish cause and effect in other countries, but a working paper of my own, which examines such relationships in New Zealand, strongly suggests that the welfare state expanded in response to a dramatic increase in state revenues, rather than the other way around. 
New Zealand, like most industrial economies of the time, operated a progressive tax regime While inflation remained low, government revenues remained quite stable. But the inflation generated by the Vietnam war in the 1960s and reinforced by the oil shocks of the 1970s, combined with the progressive tax regime to generate a massive inflow of revenue without any need for government to introduce a tax billthe current equivalent of taxation without representation. 
Many political parties of the left continue to advocate progressive taxes combined with a ""lenient"" approach to inflation. Maybe these findings explain why.

SIR-Your article on South Africa's ""Coloured"" people (April 13th) is weakened by an important omission. The Coloured community has indeed found room in the current political dispensation. Cheryl Carolus is the ANC's deputy secretary-general. Jessie Duarte is minister of safety and security in Gauteng, the country's most important province. Alan Boesak, had he not disgraced himself, would now be ambassador to the United Nations. It is not true that the Coloured section of our population has simply been left out in the cold.

Savings in Singapore 
SIR-Your article ""Thinking the unthinkable"" (April 27th) is mistaken in stating that Singapore's state pension scheme is funded by tax revenues. Under the Central Provident Fund (CPF) employees and their employers contribute to individual accounts, not to a common pool. Each CPF member draws out only what he himself and his employer have put in. It is a personal savings system, not a tax scheme.

First Secretary Singapore High Commission London ","Russia's position SIR-Your leader ""Russia the notso-great"" (April 20th) wisely advises the next occupant of the Kremlin against a return to a policy of mischief-making in international affairs. Yet your suggestion that the defining element of a great power has now shifted ""from the battlefield to the marketplace"", although substantially correct and innovative, represents only part of the existing strategic reality. Although it remains undeniable that without economic prosperity no country can claim superpower status forever, it is equally true that the availability of nuclear weapons provides an enduring force-multiplier which transcends mere economic comparisons. The West feared Moscow for decades because the Kremlin's military intentions were expansionary or, at very best, unpredictable; it no longer fears Russia precisely because these elements have largely been dispelled. Sadly, those Russian politicians who rally against what they perceive as Boris Yeltsin's slavish cooperation with the West may have a point: in the absence of economic revival, the maintenance of a level of unpredictability about Russia's future behaviour may force western governments to listen more, rather than less, to Moscow's wishes. 
After the collapse of communism the Russians were told to stop selling weapons, only to see western arms exports soar. They were also asked to support the Gulf war and western policy in Yugoslavia, but subsequently were excluded from the management of both conflicts. The West genuinely wants to treat Russia as a great power but pretends that this carries no strategic price. Almost regardless of who is elected president this summer, the main question is not whether Russia will remain cooperative but, rather, whether Russian interests can be made to coincide with those of the West Pretending that such differences do not exist is part of the current problem, and it may well be that only by becoming embroiled in a new mischief-making policy will Moscow ultimately realise both the inherently flawed basis of its power and the limits of western tolerance.

Tuned in 
SIR-I disagree with your leader ""Switch it off' (April 13th). I do not consider public broadcasting a subsidy. According to my dictionary, a subsidy is a ""grant of money from government to a private enterprise considered beneficial to the public."" This is clearly not the case with public broadcasting. 
Radio and television broadcasting are state services just like roads, trains and water. By this logic, providing roads and water to sparse rural areas is not subsidising the citizenry but a state obligation. 
If state-financed public television did not exist, who would produce and air unprofitable but necessary programmes? This has nothing to do with spectrum scarcity; rather, it concerns the concept that the airwaves belong to the community and that noncommercial programmes should also be produced. In America, for example, public radio is the only place where one can really get information. 
If, on the other hand, by ""subsidy"" you refer to the fact that some public broadcasters are also financed by advertising, and are therefore subsidised by the private sector, I agree with you that such subsidy should be eliminated. 
The anomaly, in this case, is that public broadcasting should not run commercials, but should be solely financed by the state.

Defeating poaching 
SIR-Your suggestion that the ivory trade ban has not worked is absurd (""Killing to be kind"", April 20th). Yes, poaching has increased in a few countries in the past two years, but the numbers are insignificant compared with the 70,000-100,000 elephants poached annually prior to the ban. In the 1980s Zimbabwe was responsible for the poaching of elephants and rhinos by its army in Mozambique and parts of its own country-it is absolutely wrong to say it had ivory trade under control. Western aid ""to enforce anti-poaching"" never materialised for most central and west African countries and yet poaching decreased substantially. And it is ridiculous to quote the rapid decline in rhinos since 1981 as a testament to the failure of trade bans when it was only in 1993 that any serious attempt was made to enforce the law in consuming countries. 
Following American trade sanctions against Taiwan, new legislation in China and other countries (all since 1993), the rhino population is now described as stable in Africa for the first time in 25 years.There is a lot more to be done, but at least let us begin by getting the facts correct. 
I was astonished to read that the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) believes ""that all killing is bad for wildlife"". That has never been the EIA'S policy. We acknowledge the few small programmes where local communities can benefit from hunting. The EIA opposes, along with the vast majority of African states, the international trade in ivory and rhino horn. That is an entirely pragmatic approach to conservation. 
DAVE CURREY Director London EIA 
The IMF replies 
SIR-Kevin Watkins's letter (April 27th) misses the mark. 
First, the supposed ""disastrous performance of IMF programmes"" is pure invention. Under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF), established in 1987 to provide concessional assistance to low-income countries, many African countries have undertaken reforms and improved their prospects for sustainable economic growth. In 1995 African countries achieved positive income growth per head for the first time since 1989. For 1996-97 the IMF projects the region's real economic growth to accelerate to about 5% annually, a rate that is higher than the projected growth of world output. 
Second, in arguing for ""debtreduction now"", Mr Watkins overlooks the responsibility of donor governments to make sure that taxpayers' money is put to good use. He also ignores the serious inequities, not to say moral hazard, that would result from severing the link between a good track record of policy reform and eligibility for exceptional assistance. The international community is surely right in encouraging the African countries concerned to extend their track records under ESAF-supported programmes in order to benefit from exceptional debt relief, in which all creditors, including the IMF, would shoulder their fair share. Given the difficulties of generating development assistance, the agitation for a ""bold"" initiative to reduce the debt of the highly indebted poor countries is understandable. But we now know that the international community has no appetite for a quick fix. Oxfam and other nongovernmental organisations should henceforth throw their weight behind a self-sustained ESAF.

Into training 
SIR-Success is possible in job training so long as policymakers look beyond their immediate goal of job placement to the root of its difficulty: lack of job skills and basic education (""What works?"", April 6th). 
Such examples do exist. A programme in New York city has found this approach successful even with homeless mothersthe youngest, poorest and least educated of the welfare population. The Train and Gain programme integrates literacy and basic education with on-the-job training and independent living skills. As a result,70 graduates formerly dependent on public assistance have found and retained employment in the past 19 months, and another 13 have moved on to higher education. 
A booming economy will do nothing for employment if potential workers are unable to read, much less type. Only an approach seeking solutions to both economic instability and the monumental needs of today's unemployed will enable nations to greet the 21st century with enough jobs for the workforce, and a workforce prepared for the jobs. 
RALPH DA COSTA NUNEZ Institute for Children and Poverty New York 
SIR-Your article on training and jobs argues that we ought not to ""expect too much"" of basic literacy and numeracy programmes for the long-term unemployed because those who have not acquired such skills ""may be beyond help of this sort"". Clever economic incentives could help. For instance, requiring a simple test of literacy and numeracy at the point of benefit application would quickly identify the illiterate.A marginal decline in benefit levels could be enacted until the applicants showed they had acquired the skills. This would provide a powerful economic incentive to acquire these vital workforce skills. Exceptions could be allowed for those who manifest learning disabilities. 
Charlottesville, Virginia THOMAS O'BRIEN 
SIR-I am not at all surprised to read that training is not the magic bullet for unemployment that most politicians would like to believe it is. 
As a former long-term member of the unemployed, and now a university undergraduate, with a long and tangled relationship with both the benefit and the training/tertiary education sectors, I knew that ages ago. But, as a member of the ""target group"", I doubt that I would have been heard, let alone listened to with any sort of respect. 
The only training schemes that I am aware of that actually make an appropriate return on the investment of time and effort by the unemployed themselves happen to be the ones that the businesses concerned (eg, electronics, clothes manufacturing) actually get involved with.

But one comment, uttered during an interview on c-sPAN on December 15th, has failed to attract the attention it deserves. Too often, Mr Clinton said, radio shows try ""to bring people down, to make you small."" And then he spoke these memorable words: ""America doesn't need small. America needs big."" 
This may be the president's largest-ever insight For the essence of America, the quality that makes this country both maddening and great, is its vast appetite for bigness. America is a land of big egos and big cars, big malls and big midriffs. One of America's national sports, basketball, celebrates freakish height. Another, football, features big athletes dressed up to look still bigger. America's caricature embodiment, Uncle Sam, has a big hat and big shoes; America's fastestgrowing town, Las Vegas, is a monument to bigness (as our lead story notes) America's politicians talk big, spend big and, generally, are big: the taller candidate has won nearly every presidential race in the 20th century. 
America's urge to bigness is likely to endure because, once entrenched, it tends to spread and magnify. When McDonald's came out with the quarter-pounder, pundits gasped; now halfpounders are a commonplace of fast food. Big roads promote big cars, which in turn require big garages. Big homes house big refrigerators, so ice-cream comes in gallon-sized containers. The ice-cream expands the American girth: a government study recently found that one in three adult Americans is overweight, up from one in four in 1980. Big people must be hydrated with big drinks. 7-Eleven stores feature the Slurpee, a take-away cup containing 44 ounces of crushed ice and soda. 
Competition spurs this process. In the 1970s the meatiest footballers weighed 250 pounds or so; now many top 300. Companies compete to be big, too. A merger between two big firms forces rivals to join forces or get crushed: this has happened with America's banks, hospitals and media companies recently. On December 15th Boeing and McDonnell Douglas announced the merger of the year (see page 89): the two aircraft makers plan to fuse, creating a company with 200,000 workers. 
It is true that, once in a while, heretics suggest that bigness is not everything. A few years ago, for example, there were fond predictions that economic power would flow to small companies making tiny things like microchips. But a few of yesterday's small high-tech firms, notably Microsoft, are not small any more; the rest cower before them. This week Intel, a big maker of small chips, demonstrated that small products do not satisfy the imagination long. It announced that it had linked 7,264 of its Pentium microprocessors together to make a supercomputer, the fastest of all time. This contraption occupies the same amount of space as 57 (American) refrigerators. 
Politicians sometimes flirt with smallness, too. Hillary Clinton wrote a book called ""It Takes a Village"", a title that displayed a disturbing preoccupation with small social groups. Fortunately, she was redeemed: the village stuff was only meant to be a big idea, and the book was a big seller. In similar vein, trendy intellectuals emphasise the need to rejuvenate civil society these days, so that a host of small institutions such as the local church can balance the power of big government. But churches are not necessarily small any more. Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois, opens its doors to 15,000 worshippers each Sunday. 
All this bigness marks America off from the rest of the world. America is the home of the Big Mac; Britons came up with the Wimpy Burger. The Germans are proud of their Mittelstand. The signature achievement of Japanese design is the niftily small Walkman. The French think being grand matters less than having a nebulous thing called grandeur. This is the source of endless tension with Americans, who think bigness qualifies them to run the world. The recent French-American spats over appointments at NATo and the UN have been contests of grandeur versus bigness. 
Why does America's passion for bigness exceed that of other lands? In part, because the country itself is big. In South Dakota, an army of sculptors has toiled for almost 50 years to fashion a rock face into a soo-foot high likeness of Crazy Horse; this sort of thing would not exist if America did not have plenty of spare mountains. Yet there is a great deal more to it than this. 
Some large countries are not really big, hard though they try. The Soviet Union had a big empire, big army, big statues of Lenin-and it disintegrated. Bits of India keep threatening to drop off China acts big, but looks merely nasty. Canada is large, but not big in the fullest sense. It has towns called Little Bear, Little Bow and Little Fort. America, on the other hand, has more places called Big than any other country in the index of the Times Atlas. Montana has Big Sky, Big Arm, Big Timer and Big Baldy Mountain. California has Big Sur and Wyoming has Big Horn. Illinois has Biggsville. 
But the really big thing about America-the thing that other countries never match-is the quality to which the president referred in his interview: a bigness of the spirit. There is plenty of big talk and big ideas; but even big egos respect the big talk of others. Politicians spend revoltingly big sums, but at least they must compete against other big spenders. There are big numbers of ethnic Irish, Italians and so on; but in its better moments, at least, America extends a big welcome to new immigrants. Bigness, in short, works because it is tempered with diversity and choice. The 7-Eleven Slurpee comes in over 25 flavours, blue raspberry included.

In South Dakota, an army of sculptors has toiled for almost 50 years to fashion a rock face into a soo-foot high likeness of Crazy Horse; this sort of thing would not exist if America did not have plenty of spare mountains. Yet there is a great deal more to it than this. 
Some large countries are not really big, hard though they try. The Soviet Union had a big empire, big army, big statues of Lenin-and it disintegrated. Bits of India keep threatening to drop off China acts big, but looks merely nasty. Canada is large, but not big in the fullest sense. It has towns called Little Bear, Little Bow and Little Fort. America, on the other hand, has more places called Big than any other country in the index of the Times Atlas. Montana has Big Sky, Big Arm, Big Timer and Big Baldy Mountain. California has Big Sur and Wyoming has Big Horn. Illinois has Biggsville. 
But the really big thing about America-the thing that other countries never match-is the quality to which the president referred in his interview: a bigness of the spirit. There is plenty of big talk and big ideas; but even big egos respect the big talk of others. Politicians spend revoltingly big sums, but at least they must compete against other big spenders. There are big numbers of ethnic Irish, Italians and so on; but in its better moments, at least, America extends a big welcome to new immigrants. Bigness, in short, works because it is tempered with diversity and choice. The 7-Eleven Slurpee comes in over 25 flavours, blue raspberry included. ",310,Hungary,A29-4558,,False,,0,True

COMPETITION can ruin your day. Western ranchers are discovering this as their last bastions of cheap grazing, state lands, are prised open for public bidding. 
Between them, the 11 western states hold title to 41m acres (17m hectares). These are divided into ""sections"", each one mile (1.6km) square As western states entered the union, they were given two sections by the government for every 36-section township (Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, desert states, were given four). Some of these sections are blessed with timber, minerals or oil. But 37m semi-arid acres of stateowned lands are used for grazing. They cost a rancher little and bring little in return. Idaho's state grazing leases on its Lgm acres earned it a mere $1.2m in 1996, or 64 cents an acre. Wyoming gets 86 cents an acre each year; Montana gets $1.39. 
Conservation groups think the land is worth more than that. They want to lease state land, fence it off from cows, and save it for hunting or protecting streams. State land boards and ranchers do not welcome their proposals. To keep out competition, they have either restricted bidding or persuaded the rancher-dominated legislatures to set up obstacles: for example, prospective lessees must be ""qualified"", or must be in the livestock business. 
Until recently, these roadblocks worked. But on October ist two environmental groups, Forest Guardians and the Southwest Environmental Centre, both based in Santa Fe, paid $770 to lease a 550acre tract of land in north-western New Mexico. It was their 12th attempt in five years to lease state land, and the first time that an environmental group has won a preferential right to lease state grazing land. They won it bya fluke: the current lessee failed to renew his lease on time. 
A preferential right gives a new bidder just one chance to win a grazing lease. No counter-bidding is allowed. The current leaseholder usually wins by merely matching the new bid or offering a dollar more. But courts view preferential bids with suspicion. The sections were originally conveyed by the government for the express purpose of supporting public schools. Although the trust agreements vary from state to state, all roughly agree that school endowment trust lands must be honoured with ""full and undivided loyalty to the beneficiaries."" 
A series of lawsuits has defined this loyalty. Starting with Nebraska in 1951, courts have obliged states to give up preferential bidding or discrimination against non-agricultural applicants. The turning point came in 1982, when the Oklahoma Education Association challenged the state's grazing system. Until then, the Oklahoma legislature set maximum prices for grazing fees and gave ranchers preferential rights. The Oklahoma supreme court changed all that, ruling that ""a state may not use school trust land to subsidise farming or ranching."" Revenues have gone up from $5m to $9.5m since Oklahoma opened its state land to competitive bidding. State leases are even advertised on television. 
Yet some revisions defy simplicity.Take the case of Oregon. The state's attorney-general agrees that Oregon's half-million acres of grazing lands must be managed to benefit the school endowment fund. However, a land swap with the federal government complicates this opinion. 
Like so much western property, land ownership in eastern Oregon is fashioned like a checkerboard. A 40,ooo-acre ranch, for example, may include 20,ooo acres owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and 5,ooo acres owned by the state. These parcels are often scattered or grouped by alternating section, an arrangement that exasperates everyone. Land swaps or consolidation help alleviate this headache. When Oregon entered into a series of swaps with the BLM, the then-leaseholders needed incentives to agree. They were given zo-year leases with 2o-year rights of renewal for state grazing land. This agreement, the lessees say, supersedes any immediate need for a public competitive auction. The result is that Oregon has done little to reform its grazing policy. 
Other states are trying to find similar loopholes. The Idaho Watersheds Project has been thwarted since 1994 in its effort to win a state grazing lease. The group did, however, win a lawsuit in June that said the current leaseholder must at least show up during the bidding process. The state therefore cancelled the lease and held another auction in October at which the two bidders were Will Ingram, the leaseholder, who submitted $io, and the Idaho Watersheds Project, which bid $2,ooo. Mr Ingram filed an appeal, currently underway. But he has since sold his ranch, which raises another question: will the state land board give the lease to someone who is not a rancher? 
Stockmen dislike the interlopers' intentions. Steve Hart, a rancher who has gone head-to-head with the Idaho Watersheds Project, says competitive bids are ""legalised harassment and extortion."" Ranchers think land tenure and stability are important, and that competition upsets the livestock industry. State land boards tend to agree. Probably the most closed state is Arizona; its gm acres of state grazing land return a mere 30 cents an acre each year to the public schools. In theory Arizona accepts applications from anyone wishing to bid on a state land lease, but in practice competitive bidding is rarely allowed. 
The voters of Colorado have taken the matter into their own hands. In an initiative in November, they removed 3m acres of state land out of general circulation and dedicated it to open space, wildlife habitat and parks. This was another blow to stockmen. Yet urban and suburban folk, who now make up most of the population of western states, are not particularly exercised by increasing money for schools. They want to protect scenic areas, an activity which, rightly or wrongly, is seen as incompatible with ranching. ","BIG HORN, WYOMING

A long struggle over the future of the z-Bar Ranch, near Strong City in east-central Kansas, ended late last year with the creation of the first national tallgrass prairie preserve. It covers 11,ooo acres (4,455 hectares) in the Flint Hills, which are among the last unploughed remnants of the great plains. 
Only up to 8% of the country's original 140 m acres of tallgrass prairie remains. Much of it is in the Flint Hills, which are too rocky to plough but good for grazing. Other patches of prairie are preserved by local governments and private groups, but the zBar is the first to gain federal protection, elevating the humble prairie almost to the status of Yellowstone and Yosemite. 
Many residents are pleased, hoping that the park will bring tourists to this isolated area. Some cattle ranchers, on the other hand, fought the preserve, fearing that federal agents would come to town with pesky environmental regulations, land restrictions and other dubious ideas cooked up in Washington; and fearing, too, that hordes of tourists would quickly ruin the prairie. 
As a nod to the ranchers, the park will be operated under an unusual arrangement which divides power between the National Park Service and a private, nonprofit group called the National Park Trust, which buys land for donation to the government. The private group will give the government only i8o acres of the ranch, including an old stone ranchhouse and school-house to be used for exhibitions of ranching life. On the remaining land the group has leased grazing rights to Ed Bass, a Texan billionaire. 
In short, the park will be as much a monument to cattle ranching as to tallgrass prairie. Yet cattlemen argue that their chomping herds are only taking the place of the migrating buffalo, which did not consult federal environmental regulations before roaming up and down the continent. Cattle will graze on the z-Bar only in the spring; by autumn, the tallgrass will reach past the saddle-horn of a horse, seven or eight feet high. 
The ranch makes an unlikely tourist attraction. Passing motorists may fail to see beauty in the gentle, barren hills, where the seasons are distinguished by varying shades of brown. (Prairie partisans describe te range or colours as red brown to burnt orange, with a splash of wild flowers in the spring.) Other federal preserves have swooping eagles and inquisitive black bears; the z-Bar offers the squawking of crows and the frozen tracks of coyotes. But there is an appeal in the simplicity of the stark land and the history of the pioneers. 
The public-private arrangement also appeals to budget-minded park officials. The limits on the government's control and expenses could serve as a model for other cash-strapped federal parks, where maintenance has declined sharply in recent years. The trade-off is that the government will have to negotiate its long-term plans with the private group. If, for instance, the government decided to put a camp-ground on part of the private property, the group would first have to agree and then buy back the grazing rights from Mr Bass. 
The final management plans for the park will not be ready for several years. Until then, visitors can take a two-mile prairie walk that fords a stream, cuts beneath cottonwood trees and crosses the grasslands. They can peek inside the old schoolhouse, where George Washington's portrait hangs over the blackboard, and look round the ranch-house, built by a pioneer who made his fortune in the West. That pioneer thought he could create an eastern aristocracy or a southern plantation on the arid plains. The stubborn tallgrass is testament to the land's resistance.

IN CONTRAST to the compulsive groupiness of rock musicians, jazz players prefer to spend their time with their music and tend to measure success by that single standard. As a trombonist once put it: ""A jazz musician would rather play a good concert for three people than a bad one for three thousand.""All the same, with their fellow players, jazzmen are collegiate and gregarious, exchanging musical ideas in a spirit of mutual support or friendly competition, uniting in a collaborative effort to raise the level of their art. Even the greatest individualists have benefited from the talents of others. 
In his legendary band, Duke Ellington provided star soloists with the ideal framework for their abilities. At the same time, they inspired him with the rich material of their personal idioms and phrases, which found their way into his compositions. In fact, Ellington was so adept at recycling what he heard his sidemen play that one of them dismissed him as ""not a composer but a compiler"". 
Ellington's creative gifts were genuine, and vast, but for much of his life he did receive crucial assistance not only from the milieu of his band, but from an actual dayin, day-out collaborator. In 1938 he met Billy Strayhorn, a young pianist-composer who was immediately brought into the ducal fold. Strayhorn became Ellington's alter ego, contributing scores to the band but functioning even more importantly as a silent partner, completing pieces Ellington left unfinished, reworking others and acting as all-purpose co-composer-sometimes credited, more often not. 
Long a subject of speculation, the nature of the Ellington-Strayhorn teamwork has at last received definitive treatment in ""Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn"" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux; $27.50. Granta; 16.99) by David Hajdu, who makes it clear that their relationship suited both men. Ellington provided Strayhorn with financial security, artistic respect and the creative medium of the Ellington band. Throughout their partnership-which lasted until Strayhorn's death in 1967-they never had a contract. Ellington simply paid all Strayhorn's bills, never stipulated how much he should compose, treated him as creative equal and friend, describing him as ""my favourite human being"". Strayhorn, a homosexual bon vivant, brilliant but self effacing, let Ellington take both the glory and the strain of stardom, while he relieved some of the artistic pressure with a talent comparable to the leader's own. 
Though occasionally there was discord over the matter of official composer credit in their joint works, Ellington always publicly acknowledged his colleague's contributions, and the many Strayhorn originals in the Ellington book speak for themselves, including the band's famous theme and greatest hit, ""Take the A Train"". Though the younger man was adept at imitating the ducal style, his own unique voice, full of subtle impressionist colours, influenced a generation of later jazz composers. 
Indeed, the Strayhorn sound played a vital role in another epoch-making jazz collaboration, that of arranger Gil Evans and trumpeter Miles Davis, who combined in the 1950s on a series of classic albums. On ""Miles Ahead"", ""Porgy and Bess"" and ""Sketches of Spain"", Evans's atmospheric scores, simultaneously lush and cool, provided the perfect setting for Davis's moody, lyrical solos. Evans's debt to Duke Ellington seemed obvious, but he himself credited not the master but his creative partner, telling Strayhorn's biographer: ""All I didthat's all I ever did-[was] try to do what Billy Strayhorn did."" 
The fruits of the Evans-Davis collaboration, and indirectly of Billy Strayhorn's partnership with Duke Ellington, can be relished anew in a sumptuous six-cD set on Colombia (CXK 67397). It includes not only the original timeless trio of albums but other orchestral works by the duo andeven more interestingly-alternate takes and rehearsal sessions and discussions, illustrating the collective process by which some of the finest jazz of the century came into being. It affirms that the individuality of jazz musicians may yield its most magnificent rewards in like-minded and committed company. 
Indeed, when such company is lacking or flouted, and individuality turns self-destructive, the results can be tragic. Both Miles Davis and Gil Evans had close ties with Charlie ""Bird"" Parker, the legendary alto saxophonist who was one of the godfathers of bebop and modern jazz. Parker was the quintessential jazz cat, walking alone both in his musical originality and, unfortunately, in a self-centred way of life which revolved around heroin and alcohol. Even the musicians who revered him finally could not tolerate his disregard for anything but his appetites. Davis, who played with Parker a lot in the 1940s, assessed him savagely: ""He was a great and a genius musician, man, but he was also one of the slimiest and greediest motherfuckers who ever lived in this world. . ."" 
""Charlie Parker: His Life and Music"" (University of Michigan Press; $29.95 and L25), a new analytical biography by Carl Woideck, a university jazz instructor, talks about ""the contradictions of a brilliant mind shrouded behind a debilitating addiction"". Or, as one of Parker's wives put it bluntly, ""All he had was a horn and a habit."" He acquired both early. A Kansas City tearaway with a doting mother, he mastered the saxophone in his teens by dint of hard, solitary ""woodshedding"", but became hooked on drugs at 15. He was notoriously unreliable, even in the face of kindness. When a local bandleader bought him a new horn instead of reprimanding him for persistent tardiness, Parker wept and promised never to be late again, then pawned the instrument and disappeared for two days. 
Despite such perversity, he inspired every group he joined; they were eager to rehearse to see what new wonders he would reveal. When one leader seemed to be on the verge of firing him for nodding off during performances, Parker's fellow bandsmen came to his room en masse, to insist he mend his ways. As one recalled the scene, ""fourteen of us ganged up on him."" 
But that kind of brotherly concern had little lasting effect. So did the attentions of his wives or the example of other bebop giants like his frequent partner, Dizzy Gillespie, who were relative models of respectability. As Mr Woideck's analyses show, Parker's life inexorably took its toll of his art: his records in the 195os-prior to his death at 34 in 1955-lack the blazing originality of his earlier work. Indeed, the saxophonist became dissatisfied with the lack of direction in jazz in general, telling a young colleague: ""We've got to go on from here."" When the musician asked who would lead the way, Parker replied: ""I'd like to be the one to do that."" 
He might have done. Unhappily, as Mr Woideck puts it, though ""his brilliance was not in question . . . discipline and sobriety were."" Those latter qualities are not popularly considered as necessary to jazz. But as these biographies and discs demonstrate, responsibility and community can be productive both for the music and for the people who practise it. ","Jazz greats are cats who walk alone. Yet no music is more fraternal. New biographies and CDs show up the tension 
IN CONTRAST to the compulsive groupiness of rock musicians, jazz players prefer to spend their time with their music and tend to measure success by that single standard. As a trombonist once put it: ""A jazz musician would rather play a good concert for three people than a bad one for three thousand.""All the same, with their fellow players, jazzmen are collegiate and gregarious, exchanging musical ideas in a spirit of mutual support or friendly competition, uniting in a collaborative effort to raise the level of their art. Even the greatest individualists have benefited from the talents of others. 
In his legendary band, Duke Ellington provided star soloists with the ideal framework for their abilities. At the same time, they inspired him with the rich material of their personal idioms and phrases, which found their way into his compositions. In fact, Ellington was so adept at recycling what he heard his sidemen play that one of them dismissed him as ""not a composer but a compiler"". 
Ellington's creative gifts were genuine, and vast, but for much of his life he did receive crucial assistance not only from the milieu of his band, but from an actual dayin, day-out collaborator. In 1938 he met Billy Strayhorn, a young pianist-composer who was immediately brought into the ducal fold. Strayhorn became Ellington's alter ego, contributing scores to the band but functioning even more importantly as a silent partner, completing pieces Ellington left unfinished, reworking others and acting as all-purpose co-composer-sometimes credited, more often not. 
Long a subject of speculation, the nature of the Ellington-Strayhorn teamwork has at last received definitive treatment in ""Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn"" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux; $27.50. Granta; 16.99) by David Hajdu, who makes it clear that their relationship suited both men. Ellington provided Strayhorn with financial security, artistic respect and the creative medium of the Ellington band. Throughout their partnership-which lasted until Strayhorn's death in 1967-they never had a contract. Ellington simply paid all Strayhorn's bills, never stipulated how much he should compose, treated him as creative equal and friend, describing him as ""my favourite human being"". Strayhorn, a homosexual bon vivant, brilliant but self effacing, let Ellington take both the glory and the strain of stardom, while he relieved some of the artistic pressure with a talent comparable to the leader's own. 
Though occasionally there was discord over the matter of official composer credit in their joint works, Ellington always publicly acknowledged his colleague's contributions, and the many Strayhorn originals in the Ellington book speak for themselves, including the band's famous theme and greatest hit, ""Take the A Train"". Though the younger man was adept at imitating the ducal style, his own unique voice, full of subtle impressionist colours, influenced a generation of later jazz composers. 
Indeed, the Strayhorn sound played a vital role in another epoch-making jazz collaboration, that of arranger Gil Evans and trumpeter Miles Davis, who combined in the 1950s on a series of classic albums. On ""Miles Ahead"", ""Porgy and Bess"" and ""Sketches of Spain"", Evans's atmospheric scores, simultaneously lush and cool, provided the perfect setting for Davis's moody, lyrical solos. Evans's debt to Duke Ellington seemed obvious, but he himself credited not the master but his creative partner, telling Strayhorn's biographer: ""All I didthat's all I ever did-[was] try to do what Billy Strayhorn did."" 
The fruits of the Evans-Davis collaboration, and indirectly of Billy Strayhorn's partnership with Duke Ellington, can be relished anew in a sumptuous six-cD set on Colombia (CXK 67397). It includes not only the original timeless trio of albums but other orchestral works by the duo andeven more interestingly-alternate takes and rehearsal sessions and discussions, illustrating the collective process by which some of the finest jazz of the century came into being. It affirms that the individuality of jazz musicians may yield its most magnificent rewards in like-minded and committed company. 
Indeed, when such company is lacking or flouted, and individuality turns self-destructive, the results can be tragic. Both Miles Davis and Gil Evans had close ties with Charlie ""Bird"" Parker, the legendary alto saxophonist who was one of the godfathers of bebop and modern jazz. Parker was the quintessential jazz cat, walking alone both in his musical originality and, unfortunately, in a self-centred way of life which revolved around heroin and alcohol. Even the musicians who revered him finally could not tolerate his disregard for anything but his appetites. Davis, who played with Parker a lot in the 1940s, assessed him savagely: ""He was a great and a genius musician, man, but he was also one of the slimiest and greediest motherfuckers who ever lived in this world. . ."" 
""Charlie Parker: His Life and Music"" (University of Michigan Press; $29.95 and L25), a new analytical biography by Carl Woideck, a university jazz instructor, talks about ""the contradictions of a brilliant mind shrouded behind a debilitating addiction"". Or, as one of Parker's wives put it bluntly, ""All he had was a horn and a habit."" He acquired both early. A Kansas City tearaway with a doting mother, he mastered the saxophone in his teens by dint of hard, solitary ""woodshedding"", but became hooked on drugs at 15. He was notoriously unreliable, even in the face of kindness. When a local bandleader bought him a new horn instead of reprimanding him for persistent tardiness, Parker wept and promised never to be late again, then pawned the instrument and disappeared for two days. 
Despite such perversity, he inspired every group he joined; they were eager to rehearse to see what new wonders he would reveal. When one leader seemed to be on the verge of firing him for nodding off during performances, Parker's fellow bandsmen came to his room en masse, to insist he mend his ways.

APPEND the three main countries of Central Europe to Germany, and the whole has a population of around 14om, close in size to Russia's. No such imperial marriage is in the offing, yet Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are growing increasingly dependent on their heavyweight neighbour to the west. Germany is certainly master to Central Europe's apprentices, as they scurry to enter NATO and the European Union. This trio of countries, it is often said, now constitutes Germany's ""backyard""-much as Mexico and Central America do for the United States. Does such talk rattle Central Europeans? Rather the opposite. They worry that Germany may lose its will to support them. 
Trust in Germany is uncommonly strong in today's Central Europe, even among the stand-offish Czechs. These former satrapies of the Soviet Union count on Germany for political support, for investment and above all for trade. The region's trade has shifted tectonically. Fully twothirds of it is now done with the Eu-and, of that, Germany accounts for half. Helmut Kohl is more admired in the region than a German chancellor ought decently to expect. 
But the German urge to respond to this new trust now faces some formidable barriers, starting with record joblessness at home. As firms move east to profit from cheap labour, Central Europe has taken a share of popular blame. As the resurrection of eastern Germany continues to swallow the country's wealth, concern is rising over the potentially stupendous costs of rescuing a fresh bunch of ""East Germanies"". Germany's tightening financial squeeze, in the effort to qualify for Europe's single currency, takes its toll. Even the solid prospects that Poles, Hungarians and Czechs have for rapidly joining NATO risk having the perverse effect of braking their drive to get into an enlarged EU. Once in NATO, their German sponsors have begun to reason, the trio should be less ardent to join the EU 
Inadvertently, the Central Europeans may even have prompted such thinking. They count on being invited this summer to join NATO in 1999, however sorely Russia resists. Yet they do not see the benefits as being purely military. In Poland, where the head of the armed forces was sacked this week in an effort to show NATO that it aims for civilian control over defence, strategic concerns plainly matter more than in Hungary or the Czech Republic But all three see NATO membership as encouraging western investment and securing economic links with the West too. That, in turn, should relieve the pressure on a strained Germany to push for the tougher goal of EU enlargement. 
The upshot is that the Central European trio, while remaining intent on full European integration, now envisage some limited form of EU membership coming their way around 2003-well after the 2000 deadline that Mr Kohl and, most recently, Jacques Chirac, France's president, have floated before them. In fact, they take such promises as political back-patting, good for morale if nothing else. The trio's chief wish now is for the EU to stick to a German-inspired schedule whereby entry negotiations should start early next year. 
Even if talks do begin then, the Central European three worry that they could lead nowhere. The German-inspired design of a .multi-speed Europe"" spreads before all three of them, putting a gloss on what they prefer not to see as second-class membership. None thinks it can plunge into a single currency, or, surely, into the EU'S farm policy. Nor do they think their low-earning workers will be free to take jobs across Europe. At this stage what they want most is better access for their goods to the single market-and dollops of money from the EU's regional and structural funds. 
German involvement has helped create an economic upsurge in Central Europe. But there is far to go. Up to 500,000 people in Poland are said to be employed by German capital, with thousands of small businesses near the border producing whatever Germany can absorb, starting with garden gnomes. But privatisation in Poland seems to have stalled. German investment, though considerable, is not what it might be in view of Poland's size (40m people) and proximity. 
That is partly Poland's fault. Its regulations virtually exclude Germans from buying land. Meanwhile, the long Oder-Neisse border seems to be in the process of closing down, not opening up. Last month Germany bumped up its 4,700-strong border police force by 1,500 to stop illegal entries-an odd way, some think, to prepare for pushing the EU frontier farther east, which is Mr Kohl's favourite rationale for enlargement. And as ordinary Poles begin to think better and better of Germany, Germans think worse of Poles, blaming them for importing drugs and crime and stealing their shiny cars. 
With Hungary (population iom), things are easier. Gyula Horn, the post-communist leader, can rely on German gratitude for his personal part, as Hungary's foreign minister, in opening the Iron Curtain in 1989-an exploit which, he is fond of reminding Germans, helped bring them their unification. There is scarcely a German city to which the sombre Mr Horn does not hold an honorary key. Past togetherness in two world wars may also help, though Hungarians lost twothirds of their territory as a result. 
With more-liberal traditions of late than either Poland or the Czech Republic, Hungary remains the prime Central European magnet for western investors, with Germans to the fore. The German Mittelstand of small and medium-sized companies has made a beeline for Hungary, winning local praise for helping to modernise Hungarian society along with the economy. Yet stubbornly high inflation and debt, and a hankering for lost Russian markets, prompt a certain wariness in Hungary over European integration. The country's future in Europe will be put to the people in a referendum. 
The10m Czechs boast the brightest economic figures, even if a famous claim by Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, that -the transformation process is basically over"" rings hollow. Old-style bureaucracy lingers and privatisation is often more apparent than real, with much ownership transferred in effect to state-run banks. But prosperous Bavaria, right across the border, is a whirring motor of Czech change. And a recent Czech-German reconciliation accord, several painful years in the making, has finally bandaged wounds left smarting on both sides since 1945. Indeed, a lot of leading Czechs now promote their republic as ready to join the European Union ahead of the other two. 
This irks the rest of Central Europe. Nor can it suit Mr Kohl. German visions of a widening EU are not fading quite so fast that the regional giant, Poland, is blurring out of the picture. Besides, one thing could unsettle even the Czechs. Some ofthe recent strains in Germany come from a sudden slide of Mr Kohl's authority. And were he to go, Central Europeans sense that the strength of Germany's political support for enlargement could go with him. ","Germany has immense influence in Central Europe .

They will learn. The president-just back from visiting their nearby southern neighbours and due farther south in October-has news for them: they've seen nothing yet.

And the United States, indeed the world, will have rediscovered the Americas. A new and normal world 
Living with this new world will sometimes be difficult, not least because Latin America will have rediscovered itself. Twenty years ago, this was the home of military regimes, of subversion and repression, in several places of guerrilla war. National frontiers were fiercely guarded by soldiers and customs men. National economies were closed, large parts of them state-owned, still more state-controlled. Today, most of this has gone-not irreversibly, but gone. In civic life, for all the corruption that still exists, choices are made by votes, not guns, among and by politicians, not self-picked caudillos. The issue is how to make the institutions of democracy work properly, not whether they should exist. Trade barriers are being pulled down, internal markets freed, state industries and services privatised. 
None of this free-marketry has been easy, because much has been painful. There have been setbacks, and there will be more. Yet the market marches on. And in most countriesabove all, Brazil (see pages 38-40) and Argentina-one thing no longer marches with it: inflation. True, it may start up again, and far more easily than statist economics could. But everywhere it is recognised as the evil that it is. 
This is indeed a new world. But not one that needs a new Columbus to claim it or reshape it. Far from it. What is new is that it is much like the rest of the developed world: poorer, but on the same economic path; self-respecting; and now, like other places, self-confident with the strength of achievement, not of nationalistic bombast. Latin America, like Canada, will long remain dependent on the United States for export markets, though trade with Europe and Asia is growing. Its migrants will still go north, legally or not. So will its drugs. Willy-nilly, it will still have to recognise the primacy of its giant neighbour. But, however imperfectly, and however unevenly-it is far from homogeneous-Latin America is today part of the same free-market, democratic society. And its countries will speak, like Canada, as free, selfrespecting countries do: as equal to equal even when they're not. 
Latin Americans are doing that already. In recent months they have fiercely criticised the United States' policies on drugs, on the treatment of immigrants, on Cuba. Along the long route to free trade, the Brazilians have vigorously challenged the American road map. You have interests, they say, so do we; you have to listen, just as we do. None of this wins friends in the United States, of course not. But all of it is part of the normal give-and-take among normal neighbours. 
So too are happier things: the rising flows of regional trade, of cross-border investment-from Canada and the United States, from one Latin country to another, from Europe and Asia-attracted by freer, wider and growing markets.Yes, and the movement of people, which means students and tourists and businessmen, not just job-seekers or drug dealers; and, at least as important, of ideas, from soap operas to macroeconomics. 
When Mr Clinton makes landfall in South America in October, it will not be on some jungle shore, home to unknown cultures, but in a half-continent not unlike his own, one of banks and stockmarkets, that makes cars-nearly 2m a year of them-and computers, pharmaceuticals and aircraft. And that knows its worth. If ever Latin America was Uncle Sam's backyard (legend exaggerates), it is so no more. This is a neighbourhood, one of rich and poor, mighty and puny-with Canada ready to act as a psychic if not physical go-between-but shared by all. This, rediscovered, is the Americas.

Every car, minibus and pick-up on the island is roaring up and down, horn blasting. And next morning, May 24th, St Lucia's new prime minister, Kenny Anthony, awakes to the real world and his biggest problem: bananas. 
Since its sugar industry closed in the 1950s, farmers in this island of 145,000 people and some other exBritish ones in the Caribbean have earned a small but steady income selling bananas to a protected market in Britain, and since 1993 have had a guaranteed duty-free slice of the whole European Union market. A quarter of St Lucia's workforce still works in agriculture, mostly growing bananas. Others earn their living transporting the fruit, making boxes, or doing the paperwork. Now all this is at risk. 
About 20% of the EU's bananas come from traditional suppliersmostly former British territories in the Caribbean and former (or still) French ones there and in Africa. Latin America supplies the rest, under a complex system of tariffs, quotas and licences. Critics of this regimeespecially in Germany, with no excolonial responsibilities to make it open its wallet or close its tastebuds-complain that Latin American bananas are cheaper and better. 
And are being kept out in defiance of World Trade Organisation rules, add Latin American producers like Ecuador and Colombia, where bananas are a big, efficient plantation business. So too says the United States, ever keen to open any farm market but its own, and homethough it grows only a few bunches, in Hawa-to the three giants of world bananas, Dole, Del Monte and Chiquita Brands. 
The objectors are right, the WTO ruled recently, after a complaint against the EU from the United States and four Latin American countries. The EU's agriculture commissioner, Franz Fischler, plans an appeal, to be heard, he hopes, by September. After that? No one in St Lucia has a clue. 
The EU's banana rules run until 2002 and are meant, supposedly, to give its traditional suppliers time to adapt. The east Caribbean growers have some advantages. They have to live with hurricanes, but not with certain banana diseases. Since 1995 they have owned a stake in the shipping, and the British distribution, of their produce, in partnership with an Irish company, Fyffes. Their growers receive a much higher share of the final price than do most Latin American ones. 
Yet, with prices dipping in recent months, margins are thin. EU bananawatchers think there has not been enough financial incentive to improve quality, and reckon five years is long enough, just, for the better Caribbean growers to improve quality and cut costs, while the smaller growers find other ways to earn a living. The Eu has allocated $160m in grants to ease the transition, provided Caribbean governments do not encourage complacency through price support. Mr Anthony thinks the industry has a future in St Lucia. He talks of tax incentives based on quality and export performance. He also hopes to see the island's official Banana Growers Association-five of whose board members are government-appointed-give way to a body run solely by the industry. 
For St Lucia, the obvious replacement crop is tourists, who already spend enough to cover most of its import bill. Nearby Dominica and St Vincent, though, have as many banana farmers, but more rain and fewer beaches. Their airports cannot take large aircraft. Despite visits from eco-tourists, yachties and cruise ships, their tourist earnings are less than a quarter of St Lucia's, and unemployment is already around 25%. Rebalancing the economy in five years would be hard. If the WTO ruling stands, they will not have that long. 
The United States is not blind to their woes. Bill Clinton met 15 Caribbean leaders in Barbados three weeks ago. The resultant document of ""Partnership for Prosperity and Security"", written in flowing diplobabble, recognised the ""critical importance"" of the European banana market to the Caribbean, and spoke of ""mutually satisfactory"" marketing arrangements. Mr Clinton said his target was EU discrimination, not the Caribbean growers, and Mrs Clinton handed over a $500,000 cheque for local micro-projects to prove it. 
But Dominica and St Vincent can rely on deeper feelings in Washington than goodwill. The administration's recent annual drug report said that trouble with bananas was making these islands vulnerable to cocaine dealers, while their farmers were diversifying into marijuana. A single eradication mission in St Vincent last September found and destroyed 1.2m cannabis plants and 7m seedlings. ","THE Labour Party wins by a landslide after 15 years out of office.

With the horrible exception of the Bosnian war, Central Europe has coped pretty well with the awkwardness of different cultures that spread acroos borders. Czechs live peacefully in Romania, Slovaks in Croatia and Hungary; pockets of Germans can be found from the Baltic states to the Balkans. Hungarian speakers make up more than 7% of Romania's people. This stew, partly a legacy of the Habsburg empire, is occasionally stirred by nationalist politicians who nurse ""historical wrongs"" and bait minorities. But a series of ""friendship treaties"" between neighbouring countries, and the lure of European Union and NATO membership, has helped calm such passions. Indeed, Hungarians and Romanians are getting along much better. Romania's government has a couple of ethnic Hungarian ministers. 
Slovaks and Hungarians are not, alas, jogging along so well. Hungary accuses Slovakia's government, led by Vladimir Meciar, the nationalist prime minister, of failing to honour a 1995 friendship treaty. Hungary is annoyed by Slovakia's failure to pass laws that would grant the 570,000 Hungarians who live in Slovakia-about 11% of the population-the right to use their mother tongue for official business. On the contrary, the Slovak education ministry this year banned the writing of school reports in Hungarian. Mr Meciar and his Hungarian counterpart, Gyula Horn, met in August in the Hungarian town of Gyor to sort things out. They agreed on nothing and found a new dispute, over the rebuilding of a bridge spanning the Danube, which marks the Slovak-Hungarian border. 
Now Mr Meciar has taken to taunting Mr Horn. Speaking to a rally of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia last week in Bratislava, Slovakia's capital, he let slip that he had suggested to Mr Horn the ""voluntary"" repatriation of Slovak Hungarians to Hungary and of Hungarian Slovaks to Slovakia. ""When I said this, the Hungarian premier blanched,"" sneered Mr Meciar. Mr Horn did not deny he had changed colour. He had refused to discuss an ethnic swap, he said, and called it ""a disgrace"". 
Mr Meciar could not have picked a touchier subject. About 180,000 Hungarians were expelled from what was still Czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war-an episode that still rankles. Many Slovaks regard their Hungarianspeaking compatriots as a fifth column. Slovakia's government includes a batch of extreme nationalists who suffer from the delusion that Hungary wants to gobble up southern Slovakia. 
The Slovak prime minister's suggestion was rounded on by independent minds in Slovakia's press. He was accused of ""racism"" and of flirting with the idea of ""ethnic cleansing"". Mr Meciar's office put out a statement on September 8th expressing ""surprise at the useless exaggeration of Meciar's notion."" The idea to ""foster a free movement of people as well as a free selection of citizenship was put forward as a topic for discussion . . . in compliance with European integration."" Perhaps, though Slovakia will not be taking part in the EU'S first wave of enlargement, largely because of Mr Meciar's antics. 
Bela Bugar, a Slovak-Hungarian parliamentarian, surely hit the nail on the head by pointing out that Mr Meciar was ""playing the Hungarian card a year before a general election"", and that it was ""extremely dangerous to put such a weapon into the hands of people.""

Facile optimism is no longerin vogue-rather the opposite. But the country may yet succeed 
IF SCARE stories were an export-earner South Africa would be a rich place these days. The country, it is said, is gripped by criminal anarchy. Skilled people are packing up and emigrating. Bureaucracies are paralysed by inexperience and intransigence. The economy is bogged down in low growth. The ruling African National Congress (ANc) and apartheid-era politicians alike are haunted by their unsavoury past. 
In short, it is whispered, the ""miracle"" of 1994, when South Africa buried its divided past and inspired awe in the outside world, is starting to unravel. It's just that no outsider dares say this aloud, the pessimists continue, for fear of appearing racist, or of spoiling an alluring myth, or of seeming to criticise Nelson Mandela, whose courage and moral stature set him above reproach. Two contradictory, but equally logical, visions of South Africa's future have been advanced since 1994. On a continent that so reliably embarrasses optimism, some regard South Africa's current troubles as the first skid down the African slope to economic collapse, ethnic warfare, lawlessness and corruption. The opposite view, inspired by the country's repeated ability to defy the pessimists, is that the government has learned from others' mistakes: South Africa will be the African exception. 
Neither version tells the whole story. As the country begins to come to terms with a less predictable post-Mandela age, what are South Africa's prospects of squaring up to its chief tasks-building a prosperous and more equitable economy; removing nagging sources of instability; and containing an explosive racial mix? 
Economic portents 
For those inclined to gloom, there are economic worries aplenty. After growing 3% last year, GDP is now expected to notch up growth of 2% in 1997, followed by 3% in 1998. This is less than the government's targets, and too little to start cutting unemployment. The sluggish economy would be worrying enough without other, external, drags on growth. One is El Nino, which is expected to bring drought early next year, and possibly wreck half the maize harvest. The other is the recent plunge in the world price of gold to less than $29o an ounce, its lowest for 18 years. Should it fall below $25o an ounce, this would lop another il percentage points from GDP growth next year, according to Standard Bank, a South African bank. 
Government finances still look bad. Despite a pledge to cut the budget deficit to 4% of GDP in 1997-98, fears about overspending in the nine provinces-which were knitted together in 1994 from the old apartheid provinces and ""bantustans""-are mounting. Some provincial bureaucracies are close to collapse thanks to mismanagement and inexperience. 
Even when the economy expands, jobs do not. Last year, despite growth of 3% in GDP, the number of formal jobs (outside farming) shrank by just over 1%. If the price of gold fails to recover, another iso,ooo jobs in the industry could disappear in the next two years. Already an estimated 2030% of adults have no formal employment at all. Part of the problem is the heavy stateimposed cost to employers of hiring and firing, which has risen under the government's new labour laws. In addition, the labour market is made sticky by an illiterate and unskilled workforce, which pushes up the cost of scarce skilled labour. 
The government has failed to put education at the centre of its reforms. The minister responsible is uninspiring. Thousands of teachers have quit under a well-intentioned but badly implemented scheme to move them to poorer schools. In formerly black schools, teachers still on the payroll cannot always be bothered to turn up; when they do, they teach in bleak, illequipped classrooms. Examination papers often circulate in advance. It isn't even possible to know whether the performance of black students, dismal in the past, has improved: the government no longer analyses examination results by race. In 1994, the last year it did so, only 49% of blacks, who make up three-quarters of the population, passed the school-leaving examination; the equivalent figure for whites was 97%. 
This is not exactly the stuffof economic miracles. Yet the gloom is by no means unrelieved. Dull though the recent growth rate of the economy may seem, it has been positive, and for five consecutive years-a feat the country had failed to achieve for more than two decades (see chart on next page). The rate of inflation is down to 8%, and should drop to less than 7% in 1998. Net foreign direct investment, though low, has at least flowed in over the past three years, after two previous years of net outflow. 
So far South Africa has escaped the economic turbulence afflicting much of Asia. Like other countries, it is somewhat at the mercy of flighty, short-term capital-but external resources have not been needed to finance a swollen balance-of-payments deficit. In the second quarter of 1997 the current-account deficit was just o.6% of GDP. (Thailand's, before its currency collapsed, was 8% of GDP.) South Africa's currency, the rand, floats freely and is far from overvalued. If anything, to judge by the inflation differential with the country's main trading partners, the rand is about lO% too cheap. Banks are independent and in the private sector; they carry a burden of bad loans estimated at just 2% of the total, far smaller than that of many Asian countries. 
The good life 
Though the benefits of economic growth are spreading only slowly to the black majority in the form of jobs, the government is trying to improve conditions for the neediest. Tin shacks and thatched mud-walled huts, where chickens peck at the ground and goats graze, are still the depressing lot of the majority. Over a quarter of adults are still illiterate But, since 1994, 1.2m houses have been wired up with electricity, and fresh-water taps have been installed for 1.7m people, eliminating the long walks women had had to make to fetch firewood and water. For the first time many villagers have been dignified with a proper address. 
At the same time, a new black middleclass is doing quite well. Today, 6% of blacks are classified as ""rich"", meaning among the top fifth of earners, compared with only 2% in 99o. These are the enthusiastic consumers of life insurance, golf-club memberships and mobile telephones, whose children now learn to play the violin or dress up in tennis whites alongside their white classmates. Black businessmen today control no less than 9% of the stockmarket-their companies are known as ""black chips""-up from nothing in 1991. 
Perhaps most important, the ANc-led government is preparing the ground for greater economic stability in future. Such is the free-market zeal of ANC ministers that it is sometimes easy to forget that only a few years ago this was a party bent on nationalising the mines, all manner of industry and the banks. Not only did the government change its mind about that, lately it has also sold an airline and radio stations, partly sold the telecommunications utility, and now plans to privatise a number of other businesses. Stricter competition laws are being drafted to stir some vigour into the oligopolistic corporate world. Trevor Manuel, the finance minister, may just miss his 4% budget-deficit target for 1997-98, but the deficit is moving in the right directiondown, from 5.1% of GDP in 1996-97. 
This shift in thinking has not been easy, nor is it complete. The ANC in government includes members of Cosatu, the main trade-union federation, and the South African Communist Party. Neither has given up faith in interventionist economics. At a recent Cosatu conference, hundreds of delegates jeered the government's conservative macroeconomic policy. When the ANC meets in Mafikeng for its national conference next week, angry voices will be urging it to alter course. 
Whether it does depends on Thabo Mbeki-currently the deputy president, who will succeed Mr Mandela as head of the ANC next week-and his team of economic ministers. They have already taken charge of economic policy and much else, as President Mandela has gradually reduced his executive role. Mr Mbeki claims, startlingly, that he will stick to his economic policy even if, one day, it costs him his friends in the unions.This is quite a declaration. Right now, the ANC's party machine is a shambles. In the run-up to the general election of 1999, it will need its friends in the unions and their well-organised branch networks. That leaves Mr Mbeki treading a delicate line between keeping them happy and suffocating the businesses on which he knows full well economic success depends. 
Stolid, though not inspiring; steady, though hardly glamorous: South Africa's economy seems likely neither to boom nor to bust. Given its alarmingly turbulent performance in the past, that may be no bad thing. True, such a prospect offers no firm guarantee-if ever there could be such a thing-of political stability. If the economy fails to grow at 6% a year or thereabouts, which it probablywill, unemployment will stay high. And a great army of jobless people hardly promises a peaceful, law-abiding citizenry. Yet today, of all the threats to South Africa's stability in the coming years, the most serious is probably not joblessness. It is certainly not the once-menacing white right-wing, nor even separatist Zulus. It is violent crime. 
A new fear 
Tucked inside page two of the main Johannesburg newspaper is a daily round-up of violence in the city, tales too common to merit much coverage. Here is one recent day's crop: two women raped at gun-point in a hair salon; a bank robbed by five armed men; an elderly woman robbed at gun-point in her home; an unidentified dead body found in the street; security guards robbed by armed gunmen; two more security guards robbed at gun-point; one policeman shot dead; a man found murdered in his home; a couple robbed at gun-point in their home; a man robbed at gun-point; one dead body found; another dead body found in a park. 
It is difficult to dispute the seriousness of violent crime in South Africa. Policemen point out that some crimes, including murder, have declined a fraction in the past two years. Yet the murder rate remains among the highest in the world-about seven times that in the United States. In the first nine months of 1997, an average of 65 people were murdered each day. Others emphasise that, outside Johannesburg, the country is reasonably safe. Yet that city is South Africa's commercial hub, and the biggest centre of population. So common is the experience of violent crime there that it has specialised trauma clinics for victims. 
The government is plainly failing to uphold the rule of law. But, disturbing as this failure may be, can the result rightly be called a descent into anarchy-as some now say? No. For the moment, that is a gross exaggeration. Admittedly, a steady ebb of skilled people is moving abroad, partly driven out (some will tell you) by crime. Yes, some investors are unwilling to pay the costs of protecting their employees, or of otherwise enticing foreigners into the country. Yes, violent crime is traumatic and shocking. But despite the violence, most South Africans carry on with their lives, go to school, herd cattle, hawk bananas, go to the office, all more or less as normal. 
That said, South African crime remains grave, not least because much of it is organised. The gaping wealth-gap doubtless tempts many into opportunistic robbery. But, since South Africa's once-authoritarian police-state opened up after 1994, organised criminals have stepped in. They have come from as far as Russia and Colombia, Nigeria and China. The police last year knew of 481 criminal syndicates involved in smuggling drugs, guns, diamonds, rhino horn or luxury cars. The armed robber who holds you up in your house may well be recruited from a local township, but he is at the bottom of a highly organised chain. He delivers the stolen goods, takes his cash and scarpers.. After that, the bosses and their henchmen take over. 
Worse still, some of these criminals work with ex-members of South Africa's security services, whose connections can still secure false papers and get police dockets destroyed. Mr Mbeki believes that some of them may even have a political motive: ""I wouldn't rule out a more orchestrated attempt to undermine the government by organised crime,"" he says. This web of corruption would be difficult for even an authoritarian government to control. The government's dilemma is clear: it is torn between an understanding of the damaging effect of violent crime, and a liberal determination to protect the rights of all citizens, whether victims or accused. 
Small changes are under way. South Africa has just set up its first detective academy, backed by the FBI and Interpol. In the past, detective work seemed to take second place to other, often violent, means of extracting information. Parliament has finally passed new laws that will tighten bail conditions and impose minimum sentences for serious crimes such as murder, rape and armed robbery. Meyer Kahn, a pugnacious businessman, has been appointed to try to run the police better. 
But this is only a start. For now, the criminal-justice system remains a mess. Dozens of convicts escape from jail each year. Only last week another six prisoners, linked to various well-publicised armed robberies, broke out. In the first six months of this year, 40% of murders were unsolved. It will take time for the government's reforms-together, one hopes, with other improvements to the system-to make South Africa a safer place. 
A rainbow country 
Though criminal violence remains the greater threat to the country's stability South Africa still treads a delicate path in containing its residual racial tensions. Neither black nor white is about to take up arms to fight for its interests. But each group still, by and large, considers its interests to exclude those of the other. Are there signs that this may change? 
The Rand Club, on Johannesburg's Loveday Street, was founded in 1887. For decades it has served as the canteen of the mining industry-a place for the Randlords, the mining bosses, to swap gossip and secure deals. It is also a fair testing-ground of South Africa's shifting ethnic snobberies. This century, it has gradually extended its membership beyond the white male AngloSaxon overclass: first to Jews, then to Afrikaners, then (only in 1994) to women. This year, it made another concession. It admitted its first black members, among them Cyril Ramaphosa, ex-secretary general of the ANc and now a rising star of the new black business elite. 
In much the same way that Afrikaners swept upwards in the 195os and 196os, black South Africans today are spreading into what were once bastions of white power. ""We've been moving much faster and much further than the Afrikaners did,"" says Mr Ramaphosa, with a hint of triumph. South Africa's task is to balance a political desire to darken the complexion of institutions such as state industries, the public broadcasting agency, the bureaucracies and the universities, against the risk of repeating the crude ethnic chauvinism of the past. 
The ANc, led by cosmopolitan types suspicious of tribal tradition, is mindful of this. Since the 1950s its animating spirit has been non-racialism: South Africa not only for blacks, the party has emphasised, but for all its people. Since 1994 its leaders have rammed home the message. ""South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity,"" reads the preamble to the constitution of 1996. ""One nation, many cultures,"" was the catchphrase for President Mandela's inauguration. ""Simunye!"", sings one television station's jingle-""We are one!""-as the viewer watches pairs of carefully colour-blended citizens. 
In some ways, the government has been remarkably sensitive to whites. There has been no post-revolutionary toppling of statues and icons. Roads still bear the names of past apartheid villains: Hendrik Verwoerd Drive; D.F. Malan Drive. Even some Afrikaner public holidays have been preserved (albeit with new names, such as ""Day of Reconciliation""). But the days of guaranteed state employment for whites are firmly over. What ANC leaders regard as staff ing institutions in a way that reflects the racial make-up of the population, grumbling whites (without irony) call cronyism. 
As in the United States, such efforts can be criticised for benefiting mostly a black middleclass. Plainly, in some ways token appointments do blacks a disservice. But the government says that hiring by race serves the longer-term interests of all South Africans. As Mr Mbeki puts it: ""If, in time, the majority of the black population sees that no change has occurred, one must expect that people will rebel."" The result might be the sort of blatant land-grab that Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, is currently attempting, with far worse consequences for racial tension. 
It should scarcely be surprising that, so soon after the controlled collapse of political apartheid, black and white still occupy worlds that coexist but seldom coincide This is reflected in the way they vote. The two biggest parties in Parliament, the ANc, which won 63% of votes in 1994, and the National Party, which took zo%, are still supported almost exclusivelybyblacks and whites, respectively. Polls suggest that just 4% of whites back the ANc; less than 3% of blacks back either of the traditionallywhite parties-the National Party and the Democratic Party-or the Freedom Front. Even the recently formed United Democratic Movement, an effort by an Afrikaner, Roelf Meyer, and an African, Bantu Holomisa, to gather multi-racial support, is favoured by just 4% of voters. Three-fifths of voters remain, now as before, stubbornly loyal to the ANC. 
South Africa has an unnerving capacity to surprise. It has already shown that miracles do happen-for the events that held the world so rapt in 1994 qualify, if any do. To follow that political miracle with an economic and social one was bound to be even more difficult, and so it has proved. 
Achieving everything the new government promised looked impossible back then, and still does. But South Africa's leaders have put in place some of the measures needed to make the country a more prosperous, more stable and less divided place. South Africa's future may well be unspectacular-neither miraculous nor catastrophic, more an ungainly muddling through. When you remember the legacy that apartheid bequeathed to the ANc, and the turmoil which so many predicted, that would be no small achievement. ","At its birth in 1994, the new South Africa seemed the brightest hope of a benighted continent. Facile optimism is no longerin vogue-rather the opposite. But the country may yet succeed 
IF SCARE stories were an export-earner South Africa would be a rich place these days. The country, it is said, is gripped by criminal anarchy. Skilled people are packing up and emigrating. Bureaucracies are paralysed by inexperience and intransigence. The economy is bogged down in low growth. The ruling African National Congress (ANc) and apartheid-era politicians alike are haunted by their unsavoury past. 
In short, it is whispered, the ""miracle"" of 1994, when South Africa buried its divided past and inspired awe in the outside world, is starting to unravel. It's just that no outsider dares say this aloud, the pessimists continue, for fear of appearing racist, or of spoiling an alluring myth, or of seeming to criticise Nelson Mandela, whose courage and moral stature set him above reproach. Two contradictory, but equally logical, visions of South Africa's future have been advanced since 1994. On a continent that so reliably embarrasses optimism, some regard South Africa's current troubles as the first skid down the African slope to economic collapse, ethnic warfare, lawlessness and corruption. The opposite view, inspired by the country's repeated ability to defy the pessimists, is that the government has learned from others' mistakes: South Africa will be the African exception. 
Neither version tells the whole story. As the country begins to come to terms with a less predictable post-Mandela age, what are South Africa's prospects of squaring up to its chief tasks-building a prosperous and more equitable economy; removing nagging sources of instability; and containing an explosive racial mix? 
Economic portents 
For those inclined to gloom, there are economic worries aplenty. After growing 3% last year, GDP is now expected to notch up growth of 2% in 1997, followed by 3% in 1998. This is less than the government's targets, and too little to start cutting unemployment. The sluggish economy would be worrying enough without other, external, drags on growth. One is El Nino, which is expected to bring drought early next year, and possibly wreck half the maize harvest. The other is the recent plunge in the world price of gold to less than $29o an ounce, its lowest for 18 years. Should it fall below $25o an ounce, this would lop another il percentage points from GDP growth next year, according to Standard Bank, a South African bank. 
Government finances still look bad. Despite a pledge to cut the budget deficit to 4% of GDP in 1997-98, fears about overspending in the nine provinces-which were knitted together in 1994 from the old apartheid provinces and ""bantustans""-are mounting. Some provincial bureaucracies are close to collapse thanks to mismanagement and inexperience. 
Even when the economy expands, jobs do not. Last year, despite growth of 3% in GDP, the number of formal jobs (outside farming) shrank by just over 1%. If the price of gold fails to recover, another iso,ooo jobs in the industry could disappear in the next two years. Already an estimated 2030% of adults have no formal employment at all. Part of the problem is the heavy stateimposed cost to employers of hiring and firing, which has risen under the government's new labour laws. In addition, the labour market is made sticky by an illiterate and unskilled workforce, which pushes up the cost of scarce skilled labour. 
The government has failed to put education at the centre of its reforms. The minister responsible is uninspiring. Thousands of teachers have quit under a well-intentioned but badly implemented scheme to move them to poorer schools. In formerly black schools, teachers still on the payroll cannot always be bothered to turn up; when they do, they teach in bleak, illequipped classrooms. Examination papers often circulate in advance. It isn't even possible to know whether the performance of black students, dismal in the past, has improved: the government no longer analyses examination results by race. In 1994, the last year it did so, only 49% of blacks, who make up three-quarters of the population, passed the school-leaving examination; the equivalent figure for whites was 97%. 
This is not exactly the stuffof economic miracles. Yet the gloom is by no means unrelieved. Dull though the recent growth rate of the economy may seem, it has been positive, and for five consecutive years-a feat the country had failed to achieve for more than two decades (see chart on next page). The rate of inflation is down to 8%, and should drop to less than 7% in 1998. Net foreign direct investment, though low, has at least flowed in over the past three years, after two previous years of net outflow. 
So far South Africa has escaped the economic turbulence afflicting much of Asia. Like other countries, it is somewhat at the mercy of flighty, short-term capital-but external resources have not been needed to finance a swollen balance-of-payments deficit. In the second quarter of 1997 the current-account deficit was just o.6% of GDP. (Thailand's, before its currency collapsed, was 8% of GDP.) South Africa's currency, the rand, floats freely and is far from overvalued. If anything, to judge by the inflation differential with the country's main trading partners, the rand is about lO% too cheap. Banks are independent and in the private sector; they carry a burden of bad loans estimated at just 2% of the total, far smaller than that of many Asian countries. 
The good life 
Though the benefits of economic growth are spreading only slowly to the black majority in the form of jobs, the government is trying to improve conditions for the neediest. Tin shacks and thatched mud-walled huts, where chickens peck at the ground and goats graze, are still the depressing lot of the majority. Over a quarter of adults are still illiterate But, since 1994, 1.2m houses have been wired up with electricity, and fresh-water taps have been installed for 1.7m people, eliminating the long walks women had had to make to fetch firewood and water. For the first time many villagers have been dignified with a proper address. 
At the same time, a new black middleclass is doing quite well. Today, 6% of blacks are classified as ""rich"", meaning among the top fifth of earners, compared with only 2% in 99o. These are the enthusiastic consumers of life insurance, golf-club memberships and mobile telephones, whose children now learn to play the violin or dress up in tennis whites alongside their white classmates. Black businessmen today control no less than 9% of the stockmarket-their companies are known as ""black chips""-up from nothing in 1991. 
Perhaps most important, the ANc-led government is preparing the ground for greater economic stability in future. Such is the free-market zeal of ANC ministers that it is sometimes easy to forget that only a few years ago this was a party bent on nationalising the mines, all manner of industry and the banks. Not only did the government change its mind about that, lately it has also sold an airline and radio stations, partly sold the telecommunications utility, and now plans to privatise a number of other businesses. Stricter competition laws are being drafted to stir some vigour into the oligopolistic corporate world. Trevor Manuel, the finance minister, may just miss his 4% budget-deficit target for 1997-98, but the deficit is moving in the right directiondown, from 5.1% of GDP in 1996-97. 
This shift in thinking has not been easy, nor is it complete. The ANC in government includes members of Cosatu, the main trade-union federation, and the South African Communist Party. Neither has given up faith in interventionist economics. At a recent Cosatu conference, hundreds of delegates jeered the government's conservative macroeconomic policy. When the ANC meets in Mafikeng for its national conference next week, angry voices will be urging it to alter course. 
Whether it does depends on Thabo Mbeki-currently the deputy president, who will succeed Mr Mandela as head of the ANC next week-and his team of economic ministers. They have already taken charge of economic policy and much else, as President Mandela has gradually reduced his executive role. Mr Mbeki claims, startlingly, that he will stick to his economic policy even if, one day, it costs him his friends in the unions.This is quite a declaration. Right now, the ANC's party machine is a shambles. In the run-up to the general election of 1999, it will need its friends in the unions and their well-organised branch networks. That leaves Mr Mbeki treading a delicate line between keeping them happy and suffocating the businesses on which he knows full well economic success depends. 
Stolid, though not inspiring; steady, though hardly glamorous: South Africa's economy seems likely neither to boom nor to bust. Given its alarmingly turbulent performance in the past, that may be no bad thing. True, such a prospect offers no firm guarantee-if ever there could be such a thing-of political stability. If the economy fails to grow at 6% a year or thereabouts, which it probablywill, unemployment will stay high. And a great army of jobless people hardly promises a peaceful, law-abiding citizenry. Yet today, of all the threats to South Africa's stability in the coming years, the most serious is probably not joblessness. It is certainly not the once-menacing white right-wing, nor even separatist Zulus. It is violent crime. 
A new fear 
Tucked inside page two of the main Johannesburg newspaper is a daily round-up of violence in the city, tales too common to merit much coverage. Here is one recent day's crop: two women raped at gun-point in a hair salon; a bank robbed by five armed men; an elderly woman robbed at gun-point in her home; an unidentified dead body found in the street; security guards robbed by armed gunmen; two more security guards robbed at gun-point; one policeman shot dead; a man found murdered in his home; a couple robbed at gun-point in their home; a man robbed at gun-point; one dead body found; another dead body found in a park. 
It is difficult to dispute the seriousness of violent crime in South Africa. Policemen point out that some crimes, including murder, have declined a fraction in the past two years. Yet the murder rate remains among the highest in the world-about seven times that in the United States. In the first nine months of 1997, an average of 65 people were murdered each day. Others emphasise that, outside Johannesburg, the country is reasonably safe. Yet that city is South Africa's commercial hub, and the biggest centre of population. So common is the experience of violent crime there that it has specialised trauma clinics for victims. 
The government is plainly failing to uphold the rule of law. But, disturbing as this failure may be, can the result rightly be called a descent into anarchy-as some now say? No. For the moment, that is a gross exaggeration. Admittedly, a steady ebb of skilled people is moving abroad, partly driven out (some will tell you) by crime. Yes, some investors are unwilling to pay the costs of protecting their employees, or of otherwise enticing foreigners into the country. Yes, violent crime is traumatic and shocking. But despite the violence, most South Africans carry on with their lives, go to school, herd cattle, hawk bananas, go to the office, all more or less as normal. 
That said, South African crime remains grave, not least because much of it is organised. The gaping wealth-gap doubtless tempts many into opportunistic robbery. But, since South Africa's once-authoritarian police-state opened up after 1994, organised criminals have stepped in. They have come from as far as Russia and Colombia, Nigeria and China. The police last year knew of 481 criminal syndicates involved in smuggling drugs, guns, diamonds, rhino horn or luxury cars. The armed robber who holds you up in your house may well be recruited from a local township, but he is at the bottom of a highly organised chain. He delivers the stolen goods, takes his cash and scarpers.. After that, the bosses and their henchmen take over. 
Worse still, some of these criminals work with ex-members of South Africa's security services, whose connections can still secure false papers and get police dockets destroyed. Mr Mbeki believes that some of them may even have a political motive: ""I wouldn't rule out a more orchestrated attempt to undermine the government by organised crime,"" he says. This web of corruption would be difficult for even an authoritarian government to control. The government's dilemma is clear: it is torn between an understanding of the damaging effect of violent crime, and a liberal determination to protect the rights of all citizens, whether victims or accused. 
Small changes are under way. South Africa has just set up its first detective academy, backed by the FBI and Interpol. In the past, detective work seemed to take second place to other, often violent, means of extracting information. Parliament has finally passed new laws that will tighten bail conditions and impose minimum sentences for serious crimes such as murder, rape and armed robbery. Meyer Kahn, a pugnacious businessman, has been appointed to try to run the police better. 
But this is only a start. For now, the criminal-justice system remains a mess. Dozens of convicts escape from jail each year. Only last week another six prisoners, linked to various well-publicised armed robberies, broke out. In the first six months of this year, 40% of murders were unsolved.

-Rudyard Kipling 
The Terrible Sea, the Trivial Sea 
EVERY age has its own view of the ocean. For Elizabethan adventurers, the seas were imagined to hold untold treasures, as the Duke of Clarence dreamt in ""Richard the Third"": ""Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, / Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, / All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea."" 
Elizabethan literature's acid-head view of the deep, as Jonathan Raban notes in his wonderful introduction to the ""Oxford Book of the Sea"", came to be replaced with an equally mannered but quite different view during the i8th century, when the ocean became a symbol of ""sublime majesty"", of billowing, elemental nature, of ""agreeable horror"". The stuff, in other words, of every 18th-century marine painting, the storms mostly imagined. 
It was from there only a step further to the Byronesque sea of the romantic i9th century, when any would-be Childe Harolde might go down to the rows of Scarborough bathing-machines and dream of the outcast hero: ""There is society where none intrudes, / By the deep Sea, and music in its roar ..."" 
Those days, however, were already the beginning of the age of mass travel, and the romance of the sea was tempered for the masses by the tedium, sea-sickness and grey terror of crossings by ferry-boat or packet. Industrialisation, too, took to the sea, in the form of burgeoning trade propelled by steam power. By century's end, Joseph Conrad was glorifying the age of sail in the certain knowledge that it had nearly run its course. 
And what of the ocean-view today? It is fully a century since Joshua Slocum, still the greatest of single-handed sailors, circumnavigated the world by himself, and 30 years since Sir Robin Knox-Johnston did the same, non-stop (""Where from?"" cried the Falmouth customs; ""Falmouth!"" he replied). Both feats now seem stale to some. Moreover, the knowledge of working sail has all but vanished. Few people need the oceans for travel. Even that sea-tied people, the British, need no longer go ""overseas"" to reach foreign lands; instead they can travel ""underseas"", to France. 
The ocean, in short, has become redundant as a travelling necessity, and less than awesome as an adversary. Instead it is a place of ""recreation"", of ""sport"". Beardies tending their little wooden ships up mud creeks have given way to ranks of floating luxury caravans in plush-appointed marinas. And with the modern view of the seas comes, alas, a modern kind of sailboat. 
Speed Demons 
If people in the West think of the ocean as anything at all these days, it may be as the stage for a new and growing set of Elizabethan adventurers, whose spoils are media glory and corporate sponsorship. They put to sea in ever faster, more extreme and more expensive yachts. The ocean was once something to be in awe of, or, as in Slocum's case, something to be charmed by. Today it is merely the medium for televised spectacle This has, as a by-product, littered the sea with yachts whose designs are evolutionary blunders. One such is pictured below, floating upside down in the Southern Ocean south-west of Australia in January, its skipper, Tony Bullimore, having just been hauled aboard the Australian navy's inflatable. He returned to England tagged a hero rather than a fool. 
Mr Bullimore survived four days trapped inside the cabin of his capsized craft, and swam to the surface when he heard his rescuers. Not all are so lucky. In similar racing accidents other single-handers have drowned. A media orgy accompanied the send-off late last summer of the Whitbread race, a round-the-world affair of 6o-foot, overgrown dinghies which, with their gung-ho crews, were so illsuited to crossing oceans that one prominent yacht designer called the combination a ""disaster waiting to happen"". 
None of this would have wider relevance if the madness were confined to a few. It is not. People are taking to sail in greater numbers, lured by new generations of boats which, because they are lighter and faster, supply quantities of pleasant terror. These boats are terrific fun as dinghies and as bigger craft raced inshore, but they are no joke if taken offshore. Yet that is where many of the new generation are being taken, in such races as the Fastnet, held every two years, and the annual Sydney-Hobart race. Today's racing boats are fundamentally unstable; they are indeed even less seaworthy than those that raced into the Fastnet storm in 1979, when 15 people drowned and 25 boats were abandoned. The lessons of the 1979 Fastnet, as they apply to yacht design, have not been learned, says one young British designer, Edward Burnett. Another disaster of the Fastnet sort is not only likely, it is probable. 
The madness resembles an earlier racing era, a century ago, when a desire to ""cheat"" yacht-racing rules in.America similarly produced boats that were light, wide and shallow. ""Skimming dishes"", they were called then, the most spectacular being Mohawk, a 14o-foot schooner that capsized under squall at anchor, drowning the owner and his guests. Today, alas, advances in construction technology have encouraged racing boats that are lighter and even more extreme. 
The risks do not stop there, for racing-boat design has infected the design of cruising boats. It so happens that many of the qualities thought desirable in the modern racing boat-a light weight in proportion to length, wide beam (ie, width) to provide stability-match the perceived requirements of the modern cruising boat. A lighter boat is a cheaper boat than a heavier one. Greater beam provides more space below to house family and friends, and more space above for sun-worshippers. The hint of a racing pedigree can only help in the marketing. Winnebago crossed with Maserati: an unbeatable combination, it seems. 
Except that such boats, while comfortable enough in harbour, are wholly unsuited to the sea. First, many lack the stability with which any seagoing boat should be generously endowed. Second, their hull design and their light weight contribute to accelerations at sea (pitching, heaving, yawing and rolling) that, as will be explained later, place physical stress on a crew, resulting in swift incapacitation. Many is the crew that has pleaded to be airlifted off such craft; many more the family that has been put off sailing for life by putting out for sea. There have been several fatal accidents recently in Britain's Solent, a protected body of water, involving cruising boats (not racing ones) that appear to have been thoroughly unseaworthy. 
The fanatical quest for speed has undermined the ""seaworthiness"" of modern yachts: that is, their ability to cope in rough conditions. Yachts' ""seakindliness"", that is, their ability to look after their crews as conditions worsen, has also gone by the board. Sailing need not be so unpleasant, nor so dangerous. That, at least, is the lesson of history. 
The Bristol Pilot Cutters 
First, though, in the phrase of pious journalists, to declare an ""interest"", though perhaps an enlightening one. This reporter sails the antithesis of the modem yacht. She was built, to no yacht-racing rule, in 1889-three years before the invention of the diesel engine, five years before Parson's marine steam-turbine. She was made in rough fashion, of pitch-pine planks nailed to hand-sawn oak frames. There is neither carbon fibre nor even glue in her build. Her mast is of a single fir tree, rather than of extruded aerospace alloy. Her rigging parts are of galvanised iron instead of high-tensile steel. And, though she is 50 feet long less her bowsprit and though she weighs about 30 tons, she has not a single, costly winch on board. All the hoisting and hauling of sails is done with simple rope purchases. 
Marianne is a surviving example of what once were the aristocracy of working sail, the Bristol Channel pilot cutters. At the height of the British empire, the industrial ports of the Bristol Channel-Bristol, Cardiff(Mar/anne's home port) and Newport-were among the world's busiest. The Bristol Channel is also one of the most difficult bodies of water to navigate, with astoundingly rough seas, the world's second most powerful tides, and innumerable mud banks and rocky shores. The iSo or so pilots of the Bristol Channel, as a body, were no doubt the world's finest-to get qualified took half a lifetime-and so too were their vessels. 
The work of a Bristol pilot was handsome when you got it, but the competition was fierce. Cutters out ""seeking""looking for an incoming steamer on which to land a pilotwould race far out into the Atlantic to be the most ""western"" boat, and therefore the first to place a pilot on board. Each time any self-respecting pilot was rowed across to the waiting steamer, he donned, no matter the weather or distance from land, his shoregoing rig of suit, fob-watch and bow-tie. 
In the end, the ascendancy of steam and the economic dislocations of the first world war together dealt a death blow to the sailing cutters. Overnight, dozens of cutters were thrown out of commission and onto the mud to rot, or into the arms of canny yachtsmen. Steam-driven pilot boats were introduced, and open competition was replaced by a pilot's roster, a cheaper proposition for the shipping companies that paid the pilots' dues. Years later a sheet of paper was found among the belongings of one Welsh pilot, Simon Bartlett. He had begun to draw up the arguments against the new pilotage service. ""I shall lose my freedom,"" was all he managed to write. 
The story of the Bristol Channel pilot cutters might indeed stir an unreconstructed sailor from the Slocum school of nostalgia to waste his money maintaining one of the 17 surviving old boats; yet there is more than nostalgia to the tale. For these boats were thrown onto the scrap heap at the peak of their evolutionary development Pilot cutters boast a winning combination of speed, seaworthiness and seakindliness. 
Old boats are different from old motor cars. Old cars may stir the blood, but they are beasts to handle and hideously expensive to maintain; nobody suggests using a 1926 Bentley as a runabout. Old boats, on the other hand, are gentler to sail, by far, than modern boats, cheaper, by far, and still make extraordinary voyages. Bristol pilot cutters, in the past couple of decades, have roamed up to Greenland and down around Cape Horn, often with owners of equal vintage. The pilots' living depended upon these boats' being fast. They had to be seaworthy, for they stayed out in the worst of seas, all year round and for days on end. And they had to be seakindly, for these big boats were handled by just a man and boy, whether racing out into the Atlantic or remaining ""hove-to"" on station. 
Many other styles of working sail evolved, through need, to show similar qualities of seaworthiness. Most notable were the turn-of-the-century pilot boats and rescue craft designed by Colin Archer, a Scottish-Norwegian. Perhaps the best description of a working-boat's seaworthiness is Captain Nicolai Anthonisen's report, dated May 1894, of the first rescue by Colin Archer's first sailing rescue craft, in the far north of Norway: 
Wind N.E Snowstorm and thick weather with extraordinary heavy sea... A telegram from Havningberg, stating that one ship and several boats had suffered total wreck. .. We set out as quickly as possible under a press of sail, and stood down towards the breakers, going as near as possible. At the entrance to the inlet the whole sea was practically one great breaker. . . The conditions were peculiarly difficult, as there was very little sea-room, and the waves were breaking at depths of ten to 12 fathoms [60-72 feet] We sailed around the vessels, poured oil on the sea and manoeuvred in such a way as to get the boats into the stream of oil, which moderated the sea considerably. 
We carried on in this way, backing, filling, tacking, gybing, as seemed best; and with good results, as in the course of three-quarters of an hour we took on board 2 souls, one of them a lady.. At midnight we reached Vardo again, and landed all our passengers safely. . . There is much enthusiasm here over our work. Numbers of people are visiting and inspecting the vessel. . . 
A Delicate Balance 
Still, modern designers of light-displacement boats often pooh-pooh the sturdy qualities of traditional boats. One of the best-known modernists, whose boats suffered considerably during the 1979 Fastnet race, put it thus: ""The worst type of boat you could be in in those conditions would be a Colin Archer, which just sits in the water and waits for the wave to hit it. A modern boat gives you far more control to pick a path through the waves downwind and it goes upwind as well."" 
It is worth recalling, however, that Colin Archer's sailing boat was the one doing the rescuing; and, eight decades later, the modem designer's sailing boats were among those being rescued. Why? 
First, static stability. The force of the wind on the sails causes a sailing boat to heel, and stability is needed to prevent it from capsizing. Static stability comes in two ways. First, as ballast hung low in the boat (usually in the keel) acting like the weight of a pendulum. Second, as form stability: a wide boat, in proportion to its length, is likely to be more stable than a narrow one, just as a raft is more stable to stand on than a log. 
Modem boats rely much more on form stability than did the old, heavily ballasted ones. That makes them stiffer (ie, more stable) at small angles of heel. The trouble is that their ""angle of vanishing stability""-the point at which they capsize-is also much lower: often 120 degrees from the vertical or less, compared with 150 degrees or more for yachts derived from more traditional lines. Further, modern boats are almost as stable upside down as they are the right way up. One boat that was lost in this year's Vendee Globe race drifted upside down for 1,500 miles, its Canadian skipper having drowned, presumably, six months earlier. Traditional boats will more readily right themselves after a knockdown, provided they do not suffer damage that lets in water. 
Next, dynamic stability. The play of forces is complex in a rough seaway, where all boats roll, but the less the safer. In essence, a wide-beamed boat that relies on form stability rolls faster from side to side than a narrower, ballasted boat will do. Beamy modern boats place accelerations on the crew that lead to seasickness faster, even if the forces do not actually cause the boat to capsize Accelerations also place a greater strain on the yacht: modern round-the-world racers, despite high-tech construction, suffer inordinately from gear failure, such as broken masts and rudders, and even snapped keels. 
In addition, everything else being equal, heavier boats, in relation to their length, are more stable in a seaway than light ones, being less vulnerable to high accelerations. Traditional boats have a displacement-to-length ratio up to four times greater than extreme-light-displacement yachts, and maybe three times that of a typical modern family cruiser. 
As Tony Marchaj, a naval architect and a brilliant analyst of boat design, has pointed out, heavy boats that have their ballast low down, rather than close to the centre of gravity, go still further in resisting rolling, thanks to their greater ""roll moment of inertia"". Imagine trying to twirl a drum majorette's baton with a weight attached to either side of the centre line. The job is harder if the weights are at each end of the baton than if they are close to centre. Again, from the point of view of comfort and seaworthiness, heavy, low-ballasted boats win the day. 
Finally, damping action. Designers of modern boats criticise the long keels of traditional boats for generating friction and for being less hydrodynamically efficient than modern fins. That is true. But as Mr Marchaj has demonstrated, long keels more effectively dissipate the rolling motion imparted by wave-force. Long keels contribute, to an under-appreciated degree, to seakindliness, as well as to seaworthiness. 
A Return to fairer Seas 
Today there are signs that yachtsmen are beginning, once again, to value craft built to the lines of the Bristol pilot cutters and the Falmouth quay punts and their kin, albeit with modern improvements in construction and rig. The clock need not be turned back a century: up through the 5os boats were built whose design evolved from, and indeed improved upon, the old hulls. Over the centuries, many poor, ignorant men learned essential lessons about seaworthiness through slow trial and error, and often they paid for their mistakes by drowning. Those lessons need not be tossed aside. 
Mr Burnett, the designer, has been inundated just lately with commissions for traditional boats. ""If you had told me a year ago that this would happen,"" he says, ""I would have laughed in disbelief"" In the end, it is the seakindly qualities of traditional boats that win the day, and that modern designers would do well to study. A stoppered barrel will be perfectly seaworthy, but it will not be seakindly, since its motion will no doubt kill its occupants. By contrast, the Bristol Channel cutter with its pilot, the Boston hooker with its fish, and the Galway pucan ferrying donkeys and seaweed among Ireland's western isles: all provided comfortable platforms for those working them, even in the worst of weather. Next time you find yourself clinging to the weather rail, cold, nervous and sick, remind yourself it does not have to be that way. ","Under the baneful influence of racing, modern sailing yachts exchange stability for speed. But the seas are as violent as ever, the waves as high. People will be killed 
This new ship here is fitted according to the reported increase of knowledge among mankind. Namely, she is cumbered end to end, with bells and trumpets and clock and wires, it has been told to me, can call voices out of the air of the waters to con the ship while her crew sleep. But sleep Thou lightly. It has not yet been told to me that the Sea has ceased to be the Sea. 
-Rudyard Kipling 
The Terrible Sea, the Trivial Sea 
EVERY age has its own view of the ocean. For Elizabethan adventurers, the seas were imagined to hold untold treasures, as the Duke of Clarence dreamt in ""Richard the Third"": ""Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, / Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, / All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea."" 
Elizabethan literature's acid-head view of the deep, as Jonathan Raban notes in his wonderful introduction to the ""Oxford Book of the Sea"", came to be replaced with an equally mannered but quite different view during the i8th century, when the ocean became a symbol of ""sublime majesty"", of billowing, elemental nature, of ""agreeable horror"". The stuff, in other words, of every 18th-century marine painting, the storms mostly imagined. 
It was from there only a step further to the Byronesque sea of the romantic i9th century, when any would-be Childe Harolde might go down to the rows of Scarborough bathing-machines and dream of the outcast hero: ""There is society where none intrudes, / By the deep Sea, and music in its roar ..."" 
Those days, however, were already the beginning of the age of mass travel, and the romance of the sea was tempered for the masses by the tedium, sea-sickness and grey terror of crossings by ferry-boat or packet. Industrialisation, too, took to the sea, in the form of burgeoning trade propelled by steam power. By century's end, Joseph Conrad was glorifying the age of sail in the certain knowledge that it had nearly run its course. 
And what of the ocean-view today? It is fully a century since Joshua Slocum, still the greatest of single-handed sailors, circumnavigated the world by himself, and 30 years since Sir Robin Knox-Johnston did the same, non-stop (""Where from?"" cried the Falmouth customs; ""Falmouth!"" he replied). Both feats now seem stale to some. Moreover, the knowledge of working sail has all but vanished. Few people need the oceans for travel. Even that sea-tied people, the British, need no longer go ""overseas"" to reach foreign lands; instead they can travel ""underseas"", to France. 
The ocean, in short, has become redundant as a travelling necessity, and less than awesome as an adversary. Instead it is a place of ""recreation"", of ""sport"". Beardies tending their little wooden ships up mud creeks have given way to ranks of floating luxury caravans in plush-appointed marinas. And with the modern view of the seas comes, alas, a modern kind of sailboat. 
Speed Demons 
If people in the West think of the ocean as anything at all these days, it may be as the stage for a new and growing set of Elizabethan adventurers, whose spoils are media glory and corporate sponsorship. They put to sea in ever faster, more extreme and more expensive yachts. The ocean was once something to be in awe of, or, as in Slocum's case, something to be charmed by. Today it is merely the medium for televised spectacle This has, as a by-product, littered the sea with yachts whose designs are evolutionary blunders. One such is pictured below, floating upside down in the Southern Ocean south-west of Australia in January, its skipper, Tony Bullimore, having just been hauled aboard the Australian navy's inflatable. He returned to England tagged a hero rather than a fool. 
Mr Bullimore survived four days trapped inside the cabin of his capsized craft, and swam to the surface when he heard his rescuers. Not all are so lucky. In similar racing accidents other single-handers have drowned. A media orgy accompanied the send-off late last summer of the Whitbread race, a round-the-world affair of 6o-foot, overgrown dinghies which, with their gung-ho crews, were so illsuited to crossing oceans that one prominent yacht designer called the combination a ""disaster waiting to happen"". 
None of this would have wider relevance if the madness were confined to a few. It is not. People are taking to sail in greater numbers, lured by new generations of boats which, because they are lighter and faster, supply quantities of pleasant terror. These boats are terrific fun as dinghies and as bigger craft raced inshore, but they are no joke if taken offshore. Yet that is where many of the new generation are being taken, in such races as the Fastnet, held every two years, and the annual Sydney-Hobart race. Today's racing boats are fundamentally unstable; they are indeed even less seaworthy than those that raced into the Fastnet storm in 1979, when 15 people drowned and 25 boats were abandoned. The lessons of the 1979 Fastnet, as they apply to yacht design, have not been learned, says one young British designer, Edward Burnett. Another disaster of the Fastnet sort is not only likely, it is probable. 
The madness resembles an earlier racing era, a century ago, when a desire to ""cheat"" yacht-racing rules in.America similarly produced boats that were light, wide and shallow. ""Skimming dishes"", they were called then, the most spectacular being Mohawk, a 14o-foot schooner that capsized under squall at anchor, drowning the owner and his guests. Today, alas, advances in construction technology have encouraged racing boats that are lighter and even more extreme. 
The risks do not stop there, for racing-boat design has infected the design of cruising boats. It so happens that many of the qualities thought desirable in the modern racing boat-a light weight in proportion to length, wide beam (ie, width) to provide stability-match the perceived requirements of the modern cruising boat. A lighter boat is a cheaper boat than a heavier one. Greater beam provides more space below to house family and friends, and more space above for sun-worshippers. The hint of a racing pedigree can only help in the marketing. Winnebago crossed with Maserati: an unbeatable combination, it seems. 
Except that such boats, while comfortable enough in harbour, are wholly unsuited to the sea. First, many lack the stability with which any seagoing boat should be generously endowed. Second, their hull design and their light weight contribute to accelerations at sea (pitching, heaving, yawing and rolling) that, as will be explained later, place physical stress on a crew, resulting in swift incapacitation. Many is the crew that has pleaded to be airlifted off such craft; many more the family that has been put off sailing for life by putting out for sea. There have been several fatal accidents recently in Britain's Solent, a protected body of water, involving cruising boats (not racing ones) that appear to have been thoroughly unseaworthy. 
The fanatical quest for speed has undermined the ""seaworthiness"" of modern yachts: that is, their ability to cope in rough conditions. Yachts' ""seakindliness"", that is, their ability to look after their crews as conditions worsen, has also gone by the board. Sailing need not be so unpleasant, nor so dangerous. That, at least, is the lesson of history. 
The Bristol Pilot Cutters 
First, though, in the phrase of pious journalists, to declare an ""interest"", though perhaps an enlightening one. This reporter sails the antithesis of the modem yacht. She was built, to no yacht-racing rule, in 1889-three years before the invention of the diesel engine, five years before Parson's marine steam-turbine. She was made in rough fashion, of pitch-pine planks nailed to hand-sawn oak frames. There is neither carbon fibre nor even glue in her build. Her mast is of a single fir tree, rather than of extruded aerospace alloy. Her rigging parts are of galvanised iron instead of high-tensile steel. And, though she is 50 feet long less her bowsprit and though she weighs about 30 tons, she has not a single, costly winch on board. All the hoisting and hauling of sails is done with simple rope purchases. 
Marianne is a surviving example of what once were the aristocracy of working sail, the Bristol Channel pilot cutters. At the height of the British empire, the industrial ports of the Bristol Channel-Bristol, Cardiff(Mar/anne's home port) and Newport-were among the world's busiest.

1998-01-03,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224092441/fulltext/3EE2D5F5E47B4EADPQ/14?accountid=14657,"A century ago, the United States jumped into the world by going to war with Spain. The Americas, and the world, are still feeling the consequences 
A HUNDRED years ago this month, in January 1898, President William McKinley ordered one of his battleships, the USS Maine, to put into Havana for an extended visit. A century later, as the leaders of the Americas prepare for a summit meeting in April, they can still hear the echoes of that neighbourly American call on Cuba. 
For much of the three previous years, Cuban rebels had been trying to win independence from Spain. They had fought a large Spanish army to a standstill and, by arson and intimidation, had brought Cuba's rich sugar industry to a halt. Under mounting pressure from the United States to end the war, the Spanish government belatedly ordered home rule for the island. That in turn provoked riots by diehard loyalists in Havana in mid-January. 
In sending the Maine, President McKinley intended a show of force ""in view of the possibility of danger to American life and property"". For a couple of weeks after the Maine's arrival in Havana harbour, nothing much happened. Then, at 9.4opm on February 15th, the ship was ripped apart by an explosion under the seamen's quarters. The Maine went down and, of a crew of 354 officers and men, 266 died. 
Today there is little doubt that-as Spain argued at the time-the explosion was accidental, caused by a fire in a coal bunker that ignited the forward magazines. The Spanish authorities did what they could to help the survivors, and offered to take part in a joint inquiry. They were rebuffed. On March 25th, an American naval court of inquiry concluded that a mine detonated under the ship had caused the magazines to explode. By then, Congress had appropriated $som, a large amount in those days, for war preparations. 
Some had been even quicker with blame. The day after the battleship went down, Theodore Roosevelt, the assistant secretary of the navy, wrote: ""The Maine was sunk by an act of dirty treachery on the part of the Spaniards."" And, like Roosevelt, a sensationalist press wanted war. 
William Randolph Hearst's New York journal had already published denunciations of Spanish atrocities in Cuba. When his war artist in Havana proposed to return home because he lacked subject-matter, Hearst had famously instructed him: ""You furnish the pictures, and I'll furnish the war."" Then, days before the Maine sank, the Journal had published a leaked letter in which the chief Spanish diplomat in Washington had referred in derogatory terms to McKinley as ""weak"" and a ""petty politician"". Now the paper urged its readers to insist on war: ""Remember the Maine; to Hell with Spain."" 
War there soon was, declared on April z3rd. It was over in less than four months. By comparison with America's civil war of 1861-65, or the wars of the 2oth century, the Spanish-American conflict was not only brief but relatively merciful. Although 5,462 American servicemen were to die in 1898, only 379 were killed in combat. Disease got most of the rest. Spain lost about 50,ooo men in its whole three-year struggle to hold on to Cuba. It was a small war, as wars go. Yet it had large consequences for both winner and loser. A century later, the explosion aboard the Maine still resounds. 
The wider manifest destiny 
For Spain, the war in effect drew a line under an era. Spanish realists in 1898 knew that their country had long been in decline. It had lost most of its American empire to independence movements early in the 19th century. But for Spain to relinquish Cuba, its ""ever-faithful isle"", was as difficult as it was for France to abandon Algeria twothirds of a century later. The Spanish government reckoned that at least a show of resistance was needed to save national honour. But the result was defeat, not only in Cuba itself but in the Philippines: a defeat that helped to consign Spain to a period of confusion and weakness from which it is only now decisively emerging. 
For the United States, on the other hand, the war of 1898 was the turningpoint that led to world power. Although it had recently overtaken Britain to become the world's largest economy, the United States had until 1898 taken care to avoid involvement in the wider world. For much of the 19th century it had pursued what John O'Sullivan, the editor of the New York Morning News, called its ""manifest destiny"": the call to spread its people across the North American continent. 
The expansion of the original United States from the Appalachians to the Pacific and the Rio Grande had indeed required dealings with outsiders. It had involved the purchase of Louisiana and Florida from France and Spain. It had also led to a war with Mexico, by which the United States acquired a huge triangle of land bounded by California and Texas. But not until the conflict with Spain in 1898 was Yankee power projected outside the North American mainland, into the Caribbean and across the Pacific 
This Spanish-American fight also opened a new chapter in the history of seapower. Warships were what decided the issue. On paper, Spain's fleet was powerful, but it was in poor condition, and some of the ships did not even have their full array of guns. In the first significant action, on May ist, Commodore George Dewey's small squadron destroyed an antiquated Spanish fleet in a morning's shelling in Manila says in the distant Philippines. In the Caribbean, a modern and generally wellled American fleet of five armoured battleships and their escorts prevented Spain from reinforcing or supplying its army in Cuba. A Spanish force of cruisers and destroyers was sent to challenge the blockade but, lacking coal, took refuge in the port of Santiago, on Cuba's south-east coast. 
To deal with Santiago's harbour defences, McKinley turned to the American army. He had called for 125,ooo volunteers to supplement the tiny peacetime army of 28,ooo men. From Tampa in Florida a hastily assembled expedition of 17,ooo troops left for Santiago under the command of General William Shafter, an obese and gouty 62-year-old civil-war veteran whom one observer called ""a floating tent"". 
Although outnumbered, the Spanish infantry fought hard, and caused enough American casualties to make Shafter blink. They were nevertheless defeated at El Caney and the San Juan Heights, in engagements in which decisive parts were played by artillery, the Gatling gun (an early machinegun) and three regiments of black Americans. But it was the redoubtable Roosevelt who stole the show. As a colonel leading a unit of(horseless) cavalry volunteers, known as the Rough Riders, he turned a relatively minor role in the San Juan battle into a national legend powerful enough to sweep him to the presidency. 
Shafter's attack failed to take the city, but it provoked the trapped Spanish fleet into a foolishly gallant attempt to break out. On a calm and sunny Sunday morning, it was destroyed by Admiral William Sampson's blockading force. With it went any Spanish hope of continuing the war. After an American expedition had occupied Puerto Rico, an armistice was signed on August 12th. News of it did not reach the Philippines until an American force had taken Manila against token resistance. 
Spain had not only lost Cuba; it had to surrender all but the most trivial remains of an empire dating back to the days of Columbus. The United States annexed Puerto Rico, the Philippines (for which it paid $20m) and the Pacific island of Guam. No wonder that, in Spain, this year will be the centenary of el desastre. 
To the students of war, the conflict seemed to vindicate Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, an adviser to McKinley, who had in 189o written a book preaching the importance of naval power. This reinforced the Americans' desire to build and control a canal across the isthmus of Panama, so that their ships could move between the Atlantic and the Pacific without going all the way round Cape Horn (as the American battleship Oregon had to do during the war). It may have encouraged the AngloGerman ""naval race"" of the next decade, and in the process set off a scramble among European powers for far-flung naval bases. 
That weary burden 
In the first world war, Britain's Grand Fleet would imitate Sampson's blockade, on a far bigger scale, in order to bottle up its German rival. And the casualties inflicted on the American troops outside Santiago by its well-entrenched Spanish defenders, armed with magazine-fed (rather than single-shot) rifles, would be colossally magnified on the battlefields of Verdun, the Somme and those other ill-starred names. 
But the best-known verdict on the Spanish-American war came from John Hay, then American ambassador to Britain. He called it ""a splendid little war, begun with the highest motives, carried on with magnificent intelligence and spirit, favoured by that fortune which favours the brave."" History's judgment is less romantic. His country's motives were more complex than Hay allowed, mixing high-mindedness with some keen self-interest. 
Although the Americans went into the war using the rhetoric of anti-colonialism, they came out of it with a mini-empire of their own. Their takeover of the Philippines moved Rudyard Kipling to write ""The White Man's Burden"", telling Americans that an empire brought pain as well as pride: 
Go bind your sons to exile To serve your captive need. 
Only 20 years later did America formally eschew the idea of imperialism; Woodrow Wilson argued after the first world war that great powers should offer self-determination to their subject peoples. 
During those 20 years, the annexation of the Philippines had led to a case of what would nowadays be called ""mission creep"". Dewey's motive in attacking the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay was almost certainly no more than to distract Spain from reinforcing the Caribbean. McKinley, a far more reluctant imperialist than Roosevelt, hesitated for weeks before deciding to claim title over the Philippines, 6,ooo miles from the American mainland. 
Yet in the end he did. Thus began the rise of the United States as an Asian power, with a chain of bases including Hawaii (annexed during the war) and Guam as well as Subic Bay in the Philippines. Meanwhile, Britain's friendly neutrality during the war, ending a century of Anglo-American friction, led to alliance in two world wars and the post-1945 ""special relationship"". 
The damage in the Americas 
Nearer home, though, the war had darker consequences. The United States had ostensibly gone to war in support of ""Cuba libre"", to give the island its freedom. That makes it hard to explain the Americans' subsequent treatment of the Cuban rebels whose cause they were supposedly backing. 
Shafter's disorganised landing near Santiago could easily have turned into a disaster when it met those well-dug-in Spaniards. That it did not was in part because of the help it got from Cuban insurgents; Calixto Garcia, the rebels' local leader, put his 7,500 men at Shafter's disposal. But, when Santiago surrendered, the Cubans were excluded from the ceremony and Shafter forbade them to enter the city bearing arms. Even more hurtfully, they found themselves shut out of the subsequent peace conference. 
Why? Some historians now argue that the sinking of the Maine was merely the pretext for America's going to war, not its true cause. It was Spain's failure to crush the rebels, they say, that brought about the American intervention; the Americans were alarmed that, by early 1898, General Maximo Gomez, the leader of Cuba's independence movement, seemed confident that he was about to win the war. 
For most of the 19th century, American policy towards Cuba had had two main aims. One was to ensure that control of the island was not transferred from weak Spain to a stronger European power. The second was the assumption-dating back at least to the days when John Quincy Adams was secretary of state in 1823-that the island would eventually come under American control. Adams said: ""Cuba, forcibly disjoined from its own unnatural connection with Spain, can gravitate only towards the North American Union."" 
In 1898, the United States insisted it had no intention of annexing the island. Nevertheless, McKinley refused to recognise the rebels as its lawful new government. On both scores, the large number of blacks in Cuba's population may have swayed the Americans' decision. They were reluctant to incorporate so many blacks into their own country; but they also feared that handing Cuba over to the rebels would lead to a repetition of what had happened in the misgoverned black republic of Haiti. 
Instead, they set up an American military government on the island, and made the withdrawal of their soldiers conditional on Cuban acceptance of the Platt amendment, which gave the United States the right to intervene in Cuba ""for the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life, property and individual liberties"". That phrase was to be frequently invoked in the next 30 years. 
Cuba became not only a protectorate but also an economic colony of the United States. After its violent break with Spain, four-fifths of the island's sugar estates were in ruins, and many of its businessmen were bankrupt American firms moved in; and soon they dominated not only the sugar and tobacco industries but the railways, public utilities and mines. For ambitious Cubans, going into politics became the likeliest route to wealth. That produced widespread corruption, and corruption led to instability. When a revolutionary government that wanted to clean up the mess seized power in Cuba in 1933, and proceeded to abrogate the Platt amendment, the United States both denied it recognition and supported Colonel Fulgencio Batista in his successful putsch against it. 
These were fateful decisions. Rightly or wrongly, Cuban nationalists believed that the United States had twice robbed them of self-determination. That is why, when Fidel Castro took Cuba into alliance with Russia in the early 196os, he at first had the sup port of most of his countrymen. 
A century of mistrust 
The chilling effects of 1898 were not confined to Cuba; they spread deeper into Latin America. The war halted a promising move towards pan-American co-operation. 
In the 19th century, a close-knit western hemisphere had seemed desirable to many leaders of the South American republics, whose own battles for independence had been inspired in part by the American revolution against British rule. By the last quarter of the century, such co-operation appeared to offer something to the United States as well: then, as today, much of Latin America was ruled by civilian governments committed to free trade, export-led growth and an open door to foreign capital. A panAmerican conference in 1888 considered, though it did not actually endorse, the idea of a customs union of all the Americas. 
The Spanish-American war put paid to this. Most South American countries-Portuguese-speaking Brazil, which gave valuable support to the United States, was a rare exception-found themselves worried by the display of Yankee power and sympathising with Spain, their former colonial ruler. Pro-Spanish demonstrations were held from Mexico city to Buenos Aires. 
Spain's defeat produced much soulsearching among South America's conservatives, who might otherwise have been natural supporters of closer relations with the United States. This was most clearly expressed in ""Ariel"", an essay by a Uruguayan, Jose Enrique Rodo, published in 19oo and dedicated ""to the youth of America"". Rodo said that Latin America, inspired by Hispanic Christianity and classical antiquity, should pursue the ideals of beauty and truth. He admired the prosperity of the United States, but he also saw that country as the source of a vulgar utilitarianism and, like some of today's critics of globalisation, feared that America wanted to impose its ideas on everybody else. 
""Ariel"" had a huge impact in the region. Rodo's Hispanicism, and his ambivalence towards democracy, were approvingly noted by conservative authoritarians. His criticism of Yankee imperialism, and his call for a movement of ""regeneration"" in the southern half of the hemisphere, also helped the rise of the populist nationalism which, after the depression of the 1930s, came to dominate much of Latin America for half a century. 
The United States, too, retreated from pan-Americanism. In the three decades after 1898, it made more than 30 military interventions in the countries of the Caribbean basin. Later, its policy towards Latin America was shaped by the cold war and by the search for allies against Castro's Cuba. Not until the 199os would Latin America, once again ruled by civilian governments committed to economic liberalism, show a solid interest in co-operation. The rebuilding of trust had taken a century. It was only in t994 that President Clinton could invite all 34 of the hemisphere's leaders (save Mr Castro) to Miami, where they agreed to negotiate a free-trade area by 2005. 
Even so, when they meet again in Chile in April, there will still be a whiff of the old mistrust. That is partly because Mr Clinton has just failed to win Congress's approval for the right to sign trade deals without endless congressional quibbling. It is also because many people in the United States see Latin America more as a source of problems-drugs and illegal immigrants-than as a reliable ally and a profitable partner. Given the huge difference of power between the two halves of the Americas, some tension has always been inevitable. But 1898 made it worse than it need have been. ","A century ago, the United States jumped into the world by going to war with Spain. The Americas, and the world, are still feeling the consequences 
A HUNDRED years ago this month, in January 1898, President William McKinley ordered one of his battleships, the USS Maine, to put into Havana for an extended visit. A century later, as the leaders of the Americas prepare for a summit meeting in April, they can still hear the echoes of that neighbourly American call on Cuba. 
For much of the three previous years, Cuban rebels had been trying to win independence from Spain. They had fought a large Spanish army to a standstill and, by arson and intimidation, had brought Cuba's rich sugar industry to a halt. Under mounting pressure from the United States to end the war, the Spanish government belatedly ordered home rule for the island. That in turn provoked riots by diehard loyalists in Havana in mid-January. 
In sending the Maine, President McKinley intended a show of force ""in view of the possibility of danger to American life and property"". For a couple of weeks after the Maine's arrival in Havana harbour, nothing much happened. Then, at 9.4opm on February 15th, the ship was ripped apart by an explosion under the seamen's quarters. The Maine went down and, of a crew of 354 officers and men, 266 died. 
Today there is little doubt that-as Spain argued at the time-the explosion was accidental, caused by a fire in a coal bunker that ignited the forward magazines. The Spanish authorities did what they could to help the survivors, and offered to take part in a joint inquiry. They were rebuffed. On March 25th, an American naval court of inquiry concluded that a mine detonated under the ship had caused the magazines to explode. By then, Congress had appropriated $som, a large amount in those days, for war preparations. 
Some had been even quicker with blame. The day after the battleship went down, Theodore Roosevelt, the assistant secretary of the navy, wrote: ""The Maine was sunk by an act of dirty treachery on the part of the Spaniards."" And, like Roosevelt, a sensationalist press wanted war. 
William Randolph Hearst's New York journal had already published denunciations of Spanish atrocities in Cuba. When his war artist in Havana proposed to return home because he lacked subject-matter, Hearst had famously instructed him: ""You furnish the pictures, and I'll furnish the war."" Then, days before the Maine sank, the Journal had published a leaked letter in which the chief Spanish diplomat in Washington had referred in derogatory terms to McKinley as ""weak"" and a ""petty politician"". Now the paper urged its readers to insist on war: ""Remember the Maine; to Hell with Spain."" 
War there soon was, declared on April z3rd. It was over in less than four months. By comparison with America's civil war of 1861-65, or the wars of the 2oth century, the Spanish-American conflict was not only brief but relatively merciful. Although 5,462 American servicemen were to die in 1898, only 379 were killed in combat. Disease got most of the rest. Spain lost about 50,ooo men in its whole three-year struggle to hold on to Cuba. It was a small war, as wars go. Yet it had large consequences for both winner and loser. A century later, the explosion aboard the Maine still resounds. 
The wider manifest destiny 
For Spain, the war in effect drew a line under an era. Spanish realists in 1898 knew that their country had long been in decline. It had lost most of its American empire to independence movements early in the 19th century. But for Spain to relinquish Cuba, its ""ever-faithful isle"", was as difficult as it was for France to abandon Algeria twothirds of a century later. The Spanish government reckoned that at least a show of resistance was needed to save national honour. But the result was defeat, not only in Cuba itself but in the Philippines: a defeat that helped to consign Spain to a period of confusion and weakness from which it is only now decisively emerging. 
For the United States, on the other hand, the war of 1898 was the turningpoint that led to world power. Although it had recently overtaken Britain to become the world's largest economy, the United States had until 1898 taken care to avoid involvement in the wider world. For much of the 19th century it had pursued what John O'Sullivan, the editor of the New York Morning News, called its ""manifest destiny"": the call to spread its people across the North American continent. 
The expansion of the original United States from the Appalachians to the Pacific and the Rio Grande had indeed required dealings with outsiders. It had involved the purchase of Louisiana and Florida from France and Spain. It had also led to a war with Mexico, by which the United States acquired a huge triangle of land bounded by California and Texas. But not until the conflict with Spain in 1898 was Yankee power projected outside the North American mainland, into the Caribbean and across the Pacific 
This Spanish-American fight also opened a new chapter in the history of seapower. Warships were what decided the issue. On paper, Spain's fleet was powerful, but it was in poor condition, and some of the ships did not even have their full array of guns. In the first significant action, on May ist, Commodore George Dewey's small squadron destroyed an antiquated Spanish fleet in a morning's shelling in Manila says in the distant Philippines. In the Caribbean, a modern and generally wellled American fleet of five armoured battleships and their escorts prevented Spain from reinforcing or supplying its army in Cuba. A Spanish force of cruisers and destroyers was sent to challenge the blockade but, lacking coal, took refuge in the port of Santiago, on Cuba's south-east coast. 
To deal with Santiago's harbour defences, McKinley turned to the American army. He had called for 125,ooo volunteers to supplement the tiny peacetime army of 28,ooo men. From Tampa in Florida a hastily assembled expedition of 17,ooo troops left for Santiago under the command of General William Shafter, an obese and gouty 62-year-old civil-war veteran whom one observer called ""a floating tent"". 
Although outnumbered, the Spanish infantry fought hard, and caused enough American casualties to make Shafter blink. They were nevertheless defeated at El Caney and the San Juan Heights, in engagements in which decisive parts were played by artillery, the Gatling gun (an early machinegun) and three regiments of black Americans. But it was the redoubtable Roosevelt who stole the show. As a colonel leading a unit of(horseless) cavalry volunteers, known as the Rough Riders, he turned a relatively minor role in the San Juan battle into a national legend powerful enough to sweep him to the presidency. 
Shafter's attack failed to take the city, but it provoked the trapped Spanish fleet into a foolishly gallant attempt to break out. On a calm and sunny Sunday morning, it was destroyed by Admiral William Sampson's blockading force. With it went any Spanish hope of continuing the war. After an American expedition had occupied Puerto Rico, an armistice was signed on August 12th. News of it did not reach the Philippines until an American force had taken Manila against token resistance.

Sir-The options open to Britain and the EU (January 3rd) are not those which you describe, and your prescription-for Britain to advocate ""the idea that Europe will need more than one, and possibly several, European Unions""-would simply confuse the other governments. 
Neither France nor Germany is, in reality, working for a ""federation"", as you define it. Helmut Kohl has denied that he wants a ""superstate"", and has proved it by vetoing at Amsterdam four relatively harmless proposals for more majority-voting, which Britain and several other governments could have accepted. The French elite, far from wanting to abolish France, seek to enhance French power and influence through the EU. EMU is a perfect example of this strategy: without it the Bundesbank will largely determine French monetary policy. 
Rhetoric about political union does not need to be taken seriously, as the inter-governmental conferences of 1985,1992 and 1997 have shown. All of them were billed by ""federalists"" as leading to it. But the conferences resulted in other things-the single market, Emu and progress on drugs and crime. 
Nor is the present arrangement only an ""enhanced customs union"". Increasingly, EU law,which takes precedence over national law, is covering an everwider range of activities. We should remember that the single market has been the biggest sharing of sovereignty since the creation of the EEC in 1957. This was not the result of a federalist plot, but largely the work of Margaret Thatcher, a Eurosceptic prime minister, and Arthur Cockfield, a free-market commissioner. 
We are members of a unique, living international organism which cannot be summed up in a phrase. EU law is a crucial part of it. You say that opt-outs will not suffice. The truth is that they should be avoided except as a last resort. To have different EU laws applying in different member states would be a recipe for confusion and disputes. 
European integration will continue because it will be in the interest of members to do more things together. Bringing in the countries of former communist Europe, an essential geopolitical aim in the long run, may slow it down a little; but will itself require some further, prior integration of decision-making in EU institutions if it is to be a success. 
I agree that electorates must not be unwilling. The Maastricht route to EMU, which is high risk and difficult to explain to ordinary people, is not helpful in this respect. Nevertheless, we must now explain the EU to British citizens properly and prepare them to make a rational decision in the EMU referendum when it comes. What we must avoid doing is suggesting that either a federation or an enhanced customs union is a realistic option. It will be a choice between in or out.

SIR-You tell us in your December 20th issue that ""Europe is moving at five speeds, at least"", and ask, ""can a multi-speed Union succeed?"" The challenge, you claim, is ""to keep the convoy moving forward without breaking up"". 
But in your January 3rd issue, you claim that governments are still ""entirely unprepared"" for the possibility of a multi-system European Union, and that the philosophy of all countries moving together towards the same destination ""must be abandoned"". Europe, you say, ""will need more than one, and possibly several EUS"", and without real flexibility, the current EU would not be ""worth saving""-as if its collapse were imminent. 
The reality is much closer to the first of your two perspectives. Flexibility has in fact long existed within the Eu-from Benelux and the WEU through to recent optouts on Emu, asylum and immigration policy, and social afFairs. It is now enshrined, as a permanent option, through the new flexibility clause in the Amsterdam treaty. Variable geometry will grow rather than recede with the passage of time. 
However, a dilute EU with few binding common policies, and everybody doing their own thing, would be an increasingly weak construct, not the powerful magnet it currently represents. If the EU is to succeed, it must reconcile size and diversity with coherence and strength. 
ANTHONY TEASDALE

SIR-You are right to argue for a ""multi-system Europe"", and it is indeed clear that the three centuries during which Britain's foreign policy on Europe has remained largely unchanged have left their mark, both on us and on our European partners. 
Perhaps the greatest difficulty for Britain now is the scent of authoritarianism and compulsion that seems more and more to hang around the European project. Here are a few examples: a national parliament where criticism of EMU was condemned as being ""anti-democratic""; a national political leader describing deeper European political integration as a matter of war and peace; and commissioners saying quite openly that a motive for the creation of the euro is to topple the dollar from its position of global hegemony. 
The sub-text seems to be that the European ""train"" has an entrance but no exit.

Sir-The Economist does its best to favour neither Eurosceptics nor Europhiles. But after much soul-searching, you give no clear idea of where Britain should go. Just as we in Europe have had to revise our traditional view of Britain as a country living in the past and lagging behind the mainstream of economic and social development, it is time for the British to revise their traditional view of the continent as a potential threat, and show enough courage to join the club.

Six-In ""The trouble with Singapore's clone"" January 3rd), you question Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yews criticism that the Suzhou city government was favouring the Suzhou New District (SND) over the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP). Although SND was in existence when SIP started in 1994, Suzhou city and Jiangsu provincial governments assured Singapore of their wholehearted support for sip, the flagship project for both countries. China's government gave special privileges only to the park, not SND. 
The Chinese and Singapore governments continue to recognise the park's importance to both countries. But it has become clear that the Suzhou government supports SND as much, if not more, providing it with land and infrastructure on special terms. Investors brought in by sip are also shown SND and offered the same support from the government if they choose SND. Last September, SND received APEC state science and technology park status, which gives it equal official standing with sip. 
This strong local government support, not just a more ""commercial"" attitude, has enabled SND to attract multinationals at the expense of sin In November, Wang jinhua, Suzhou's vicemayor, publicly denigrated sin to investors in Germany. He advised them to go directly into China without Singapore, and denied that President Jiang Zemin supported sip. He also told them that all resources in Jiangsu province and Suzhou city would be placed behind SND. This raised a fundamental issue of confidence: whether Singapore can deliver to investors the full co-operation and support of the Suzhou authorities. 
The Chinese adage ""shan gao huang diyuan""(the mountain is high, and the emperor is far away) describes this age-old problem. Because of China's enormous size, local authorities can frustrate central government's intentions. 
Mr Lee raised the matter publicly so that it can be resolved openly, and the arrangements restructured into a win-win situation for Suzhou, Singapore and foreign investors.

Race and intelligence 
SIR-Your article on twins (""The mirror of your soul"",January 3rd) rightly mentions that the Pioneer Fund has been accused of, but strongly denies, racist motives. Over the past 60 years, Pioneer has made unfettered research grants to more than 60 institutions in eight countries, with the bulk of the grants going towards research into behaviour genetics, intelligence and demographics. A relatively small proportion went to research into racial differences. Pioneer concluded long ago that racial variation is an integral part of human variation, and deserves dispassionate study by responsible scientists. 
In that connection I believe your description of Philippe Rushton's work is not a balanced one. Research on genital size was done by the United Nations (for condoms for AIDS prevention), not by Mr Rushton,who has cited this work only briefly.

SIR-You cite me as a ""controversial figure"" financed by the Pioneer Fund, which has been accused of""racist motives"". True, I research the relationship between brain size and IQS in different races. But you might have mentioned that the chairman of the American Psychological Association task force, which you also cite, agrees with my empirical work, concluding that, with respect to ""racial differences in the mean measured sizes of skulls and brains (with East Asians having the largest, followed by whites and then blacks) ... there is indeed a small overall trend."" (Ulric Neisser in American Psychologist 1997.) 
Although race science has been abused in the past, and despite the danger of over-generalisation, there is no alternative to discovering the truth about ourselves, however much some may prefer us not to. Pioneer and its scientists are above reproach in this matter.

Extreme machines 
SIR-I hope that in matters in which I am ill informed, you offer more enlightened views than does your piece on yachting (December 20th). The central thesis appears to be that intense competitive pressures have pushed designers, owners and crews beyond the limits of sanity, whereas traditional designs are altogether more seaworthy. This thesis has no merit. I concede that the extreme Vendee Globe boats show disturbingly high stability, both static and dynamic, when they are turned upside down. This problem has been recognised and will be fixed. 
Since the day men first hoisted sails, boats and crews have been lost at sea. The great clipper ships, the evolutionary product of centuries of sailing, were lost in large numbers in the same infamous southern oceans where the Vendee boats came to such grief. Any boat under about loo feet can be capsized in severe conditions if it meets the right wave. And over the past two decades, more sailors have rounded Cape Horn than in the 80 previous years; they have done so in increasingly light boats, including catamarans and trimarans, with very little loss of life. 
The sailors of yore-in the days when CNN did not exist to broadcast their fate, and when The Economist was too busy covering the empire-died unnoticed. The issue is largely one of public perception and the role of media in shaping it.

SIR-I write as a member of the design team that was responsible for Grimalkin, which you criticise. To compare a Bristol Channel pilot cutter with a Vendee Globe competitor is like comparing a Morris Minor with a Formula One car. No one ever said a modern racing machine has to be either comfortable or easy to handle. Statistics would probably show that an old Morris Minor is safer than, say, a modern Porsche, but buyers still prefer to accept the risk of a more exciting drive, relying on their own competence for their safety. 
The vast majority of yachting casualties are due to bad handling or a skipper's bad judgment. True, a slow, traditional boat such as a pilot cutter will look after its crew whatever mistakes they make. But most sailors prefer the exhilaration of a lively yacht, and they use their skill to avoid coming to any harm. 
Thousands of people enjoy their time afloat in modern yachts. Recreational yachts are seldom in conditions where the point of vanishing stability is likely to be relevant. Surely the most dangerous part of the voyage is the drive to the marina. 
BUTCH 
DALRYMPLE-SMITH 
Le Cannet,

SIR-You cite the 1889 Bristol pilot cutter Dyarchy as a paragon of speed and seakindliness. My late father, Laurent Giles, was commissioned in 1937 to design a more modern interpretation of those principles, in a new Dyarchy. With lighter displacement and a cut-away forefoot, she was superior to the old boat in performance. 
Only a few years after Dyarchy, my father designed perhaps the most revolutionary light-displacement ocean-racing yacht of all time, Myth of Malham. She won two Fastnets and was still in the British Admiral's Cup team as late as 1961. 
As one who had fun sailing both of these extraordinary yachts, I would think that, given the most likely extreme conditions of danger for family cruising (clawing to windward off a lee-shore in high wind and sea, without engine), Myth would have been my choice. In a less likely situation for the average yachtsman, that of riding out a huge storm at sea, I do not doubt that Dyarchy would be the more comfortable and seakindly. 
DAVID GILES 
London ","Britain in Europe 
Sir-The options open to Britain and the EU (January 3rd) are not those which you describe, and your prescription-for Britain to advocate ""the idea that Europe will need more than one, and possibly several, European Unions""-would simply confuse the other governments. 
Neither France nor Germany is, in reality, working for a ""federation"", as you define it. Helmut Kohl has denied that he wants a ""superstate"", and has proved it by vetoing at Amsterdam four relatively harmless proposals for more majority-voting, which Britain and several other governments could have accepted. The French elite, far from wanting to abolish France, seek to enhance French power and influence through the EU. EMU is a perfect example of this strategy: without it the Bundesbank will largely determine French monetary policy. 
Rhetoric about political union does not need to be taken seriously, as the inter-governmental conferences of 1985,1992 and 1997 have shown. All of them were billed by ""federalists"" as leading to it. But the conferences resulted in other things-the single market, Emu and progress on drugs and crime. 
Nor is the present arrangement only an ""enhanced customs union"". Increasingly, EU law,which takes precedence over national law, is covering an everwider range of activities. We should remember that the single market has been the biggest sharing of sovereignty since the creation of the EEC in 1957. This was not the result of a federalist plot, but largely the work of Margaret Thatcher, a Eurosceptic prime minister, and Arthur Cockfield, a free-market commissioner. 
We are members of a unique, living international organism which cannot be summed up in a phrase. EU law is a crucial part of it. You say that opt-outs will not suffice. The truth is that they should be avoided except as a last resort. To have different EU laws applying in different member states would be a recipe for confusion and disputes. 
European integration will continue because it will be in the interest of members to do more things together. Bringing in the countries of former communist Europe, an essential geopolitical aim in the long run, may slow it down a little; but will itself require some further, prior integration of decision-making in EU institutions if it is to be a success. 
I agree that electorates must not be unwilling. The Maastricht route to EMU, which is high risk and difficult to explain to ordinary people, is not helpful in this respect. Nevertheless, we must now explain the EU to British citizens properly and prepare them to make a rational decision in the EMU referendum when it comes. What we must avoid doing is suggesting that either a federation or an enhanced customs union is a realistic option. It will be a choice between in or out. 
MICHAEL BUTLER 
Former ambassador to the Ec 
London 
SIR-You tell us in your December 20th issue that ""Europe is moving at five speeds, at least"", and ask, ""can a multi-speed Union succeed?"" The challenge, you claim, is ""to keep the convoy moving forward without breaking up"". 
But in your January 3rd issue, you claim that governments are still ""entirely unprepared"" for the possibility of a multi-system European Union, and that the philosophy of all countries moving together towards the same destination ""must be abandoned"". Europe, you say, ""will need more than one, and possibly several EUS"", and without real flexibility, the current EU would not be ""worth saving""-as if its collapse were imminent. 
The reality is much closer to the first of your two perspectives. Flexibility has in fact long existed within the Eu-from Benelux and the WEU through to recent optouts on Emu, asylum and immigration policy, and social afFairs. It is now enshrined, as a permanent option, through the new flexibility clause in the Amsterdam treaty. Variable geometry will grow rather than recede with the passage of time. 
However, a dilute EU with few binding common policies, and everybody doing their own thing, would be an increasingly weak construct, not the powerful magnet it currently represents. If the EU is to succeed, it must reconcile size and diversity with coherence and strength. 
ANTHONY TEASDALE 
London 
SIR-You are right to argue for a ""multi-system Europe"", and it is indeed clear that the three centuries during which Britain's foreign policy on Europe has remained largely unchanged have left their mark, both on us and on our European partners. 
Perhaps the greatest difficulty for Britain now is the scent of authoritarianism and compulsion that seems more and more to hang around the European project. Here are a few examples: a national parliament where criticism of EMU was condemned as being ""anti-democratic""; a national political leader describing deeper European political integration as a matter of war and peace; and commissioners saying quite openly that a motive for the creation of the euro is to topple the dollar from its position of global hegemony. 
The sub-text seems to be that the European ""train"" has an entrance but no exit. 
BRIAN GILL 
London 
Sir-The Economist does its best to favour neither Eurosceptics nor Europhiles. But after much soul-searching, you give no clear idea of where Britain should go. Just as we in Europe have had to revise our traditional view of Britain as a country living in the past and lagging behind the mainstream of economic and social development, it is time for the British to revise their traditional view of the continent as a potential threat, and show enough courage to join the club. The sooner the better.

SIR-You misinterpret Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia's position (""Monarchs and mountebanks"", December 20th) with respect to endorsements of, or alliances with, any ofthe competing political parties or leaders. Prince Alexander has consistently reiterated, in interviews and speeches, a policy of not endorsing any party or politician. 
The prince has consistently supported the establishment of a fair and democratic political process, including fair elections, a free press and absence of government coercion in all of the successor states of the former kingdom of Yugoslavia. Only with the establishment of democratic institutions would it be possible to know the true desires of citizens anywhere in Yugoslavia. Any statement today, by anyone, about the potential of a return to monarchy in Yugoslavia is merely speculative.

SIR-Otto von Habsburg is mentioned as the grandson of Emperor Franz Joseph II, which he is not. Archduke Otto is the eldest son of Charles 1, the last emperor of Austria and king of Hungary. Charles I was the grandson of Archduke Karl Ludwig, Franz Joseph II's brother. Archduke Otto formally renounced his rights to the Austrian throne on May 31st 1961, but he has never renounced the throne of Hungary. He has chosen not to fight for it, but to defend the right to join the European Union of the Hungarians and all the people of his monarchy, now scattered in 12 European countries.

ONE of Chekhov's closest friends, the publisher Suvorin, observed that the writer was a man of ""flint"", that his talent was ""cruel"", his objectivity ""harsh"". At the same time, as Donald Rayfield shows, Chekhov was as tender as a snail-horn at the spectacle of human cruelty and injustice. When his Tartar servant was punched by a ship's officer for being among first-class passengers, the victim saw his master's agonised face and said: ""You haven't hit me, you've hit him:' 
In this extraordinarily rich and crowded biography, both Chekhovs are presented. Mr Rayfield's approach is not analytical so much as revelatory, his canvas built up stroke by stroke in dense, often short, sentences, laid down as though by a palette knife: the family bought out of serfdom by a hard and thrifty grandfather; a musical father steeped in the liturgy who thrashed his sons through childhood; poverty and intermittent education; debt and bankruptcy; medical training and doctoring by day, short stories by night; everywhere 'rs--his own and others'-and the drunken fecklessness of his brothers. 
Mr Rayfield eschews psychology, but his picture says it all. Chekhov's almost brutal lack of sentiment, his irony, impatience and repulsion emerge without the necessity for comment or excuse. So does his surprising bawdiness: ""There's still nobody to screw,"" he writes in one letter, and again, ""so much work that there's no time even for a quiet fart."" 
But by the same token, basic human decency became a desperate necessity to him. Tolerance, common politeness, an aesthetic sense, these were triumphs won in the teeth of vulgarity and viciousness. There was nothing gentle about his belief in gentleness. He hammered his dissolute, filthy artist-brother with it: ""The lower-class flesh brought up on thrashings, wine-cellars and hand-outs shows,"" he wrote. Well-bred people ""can't eat out of an old paraffin can . . . they need from a woman not bed, not equine sweat . . . not a hole . . . smash the vodka decanter and lie down and read. . "" 
Chekhov's Russia, struggling with censorship, poverty and disease, seems to have consisted largely of people battening on each other, and particularly on anyone who showed above the ruck. As a doctor, Chekhov was besieged by friends and family; as an increasingly known and wellpaid author he was harried for favours, loans, help in finding jobs: ""If you reject my request, please send the revolver which we bought together. ."" Friends and hangers-on came and went, or stayed interminably, especially at Melikhovo, the country house he bought in order to find peace: ""all day eating and talking, eating and talking,"" he wrote despairingly to Suvorin. For the sake of his writing, he often stonewalled. The flint that Suvorin noticed was his fundamental detachment as an artist. 
The result was that although Chekhov was capable of great delicacy of feeling-for example, buying quantities of stamps from the local postmaster before a journey in order that, as the man's biggest customer, his departure might not impoverish him; and though his conscience drove him to carry out great works of public usefulness-he built schools, libraries and clinics, and made a heroic journey to Sakhalin island to report on the condition of the prisoners there; nevertheless he was personally evasive, uncommitted and in a curious way irresponsible. 
Women flocked to him; he charmed them, slept with them and rebuffed them. His housekeeper-sister, Masha, was the only one he needed, and he saw off all her suitors. The pressure of impending death and the need for peace kept the world and his lovers ruthlessly at bay. They became material for his plays and stories where, even there, he stands, however sympathetically, apart. Chekhov did at last, hesitantly, marry-lga Knipper, the lead actress of the Moscow Arts Theatre and his Madame Ranyevskaya in ""The Cherry Orchard""but by then TB had banished him from Moscow to the warmth of Yalta. 
This is a teeming, almost hectic, biography. The mass of sources-diaries, memoirs and letters, some never before publishedenables Mr Rayfield to keep track of a huge cast of characters, quarrelling, gossiping, swapping dogs, fishing, gardening, and of course constantly writing to and about each other. If Chekhov himself is elusive, it is no more than he was to those who knew him. It is the book's strength that Mr Rayfield gives himself and his reader the distance of a friend rather than attempting the close-up that nobody ever saw. ","ANTON CHEKHov: A LIFF.

The second ""summit of the Americas"" opens in Chile next week. It will give formal approval to negotiations intended to lead to free trade from Alaska to Cape Horn. But that project needs broader political support 
WHEN in December 1994 Bill Clinton welcomed to Miami the leaders of 33 other countries in the Americas, their meeting was widely seen as the start of a new chapter in the often troubled relations between the United States and Latin America. With the cold war over, elected governments in power everywhere except (uninvited) Cuba, and with market reforms and freer trade supplanting statist protectionism, many old sources of tension seemed to have been replaced by shared ideas and new opportunities for co-operation. 
Chief among these was the notion, mooted earlier by President George Bush in 199o, of a ""free-trade area of the Americas"" (FTAA), stretching from Alaska to Cape Horn. In Miami, Latin America's leaders embraced the idea with surprising enthusiasm. A target date of 2005 was set for its achievement, with ""concrete progress"" to be made by 2000. Alongside this, the 34 summiteers put their names to a long list of collective virtue, 150 ""action items"" concerned with topics ranging from health services through women's rights to the environment. 
On April 18th and 19th in the Chilean capital, Santiago, the 34 countries' leaders meet again. They will formally launch the FTAA negotiations. After three years of hard talking, at a final preparatory meeting in Costa Rica last month their trade ministers agreed to a detailed agenda of what to negotiate, how, where and when. Their ambitious dream might seem, at first glance, to be steadily becoming a reality. 
True, the FTAA concept faces criticism. Some economists argue that regional preferences divert more trade than they create. Some Latin Americans fear that the cost of adjusting to free trade with the world's most powerful economy will far outweigh the benefits, especially in smaller and less developed countries. Trade unions in the United States express the opposite fear, foreseeing a flight of jobs to lower-wage countries farther south. 
Yet Latin American governments have concluded that they do want an FrA. Such studies as exist suggest that guaranteed access to the United States market would add to growth both by boosting exports, especially of manufactures, and by attracting extra foreign investment. And if an FTAA, comes to be, no country can afford to be left out. The United States can foresee corresponding benefits, as faster growth to its south boosts demand for its exports. Already, Latin American countries' unilateral lowering of trade barriers has made the region the United States' fastest-growing foreign market. Last year, Mexico overtook Japan to become the second-largest importer of United States goods, after Canada. The FTAA has a geopolitical attraction too: it would lock in free-marketry as the way of life throughout the Americas. 
Nor will trade be the only, or even the first, item on the Santiago agenda. The summit will discuss democracy, education and poverty; and, not least, drugs. Latin Americans resent the United States' practice of unilaterally ""certifying""-or decertifyingother countries as dependable allies in the war against drugs. Mr Clinton cannot just abandon this: it is enshrined in American law. But Santiago may be a first step toward parallel, multilateral monitoring of efforts to curb not just the (Latin American) supply of drugs, but the (United States') demand for them. And the assembled leaders may agree to make their summits regular, perhaps three-early, affairs. In sum, here, says Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, is ua mature partnership."" 
A smoggy prospect 
Yet a sense of anti-climax will hang as thickly in the air as the Santiago smog. One reason is simply that this is the second time round: Miami was a giant step, the first pan-American summit since an ineffectual affair 27 years earlier whose main, American-inspired aim was to isolate Cuba. And whereas the Miami invitations came from the leader of the world's superpower, Santiago has been arranged by a 34-country group, more democratic but more routine. The big reason, however, is a widespread feeling that the United States has again lost interest in Latin America, and that its policies in the region-whether on trade, drugs or Cuba-are being driven by domestic politics, not broad, strategic vision. 
That disillusionment has been crystallised by Mr Clinton's failure to win fast-track trade-negotiating authority from Congress. It was this that scuppered the American pledge made to Chile in 1994 that the first step toward free trade would be Chile's admission to the (then new) NAFTA accord linking the United States with Canada and Mexico. Not till last year did the Clinton administration even put forward a fast-track bill-only to withdraw it last November, rather than risk its defeat. 
Without fast-track, some say, the whole FTAA exercise may be futile. The United States has had years of solid growth. Unemployment is low, the trade deficit small. If Mr Clinton cannot get his way on trade now, these sceptics ask, when can he? And of all imaginable trade deals, the American public is especially hostile to Latin American ones, thanks to its experience with NAFTA-or, more accurately, to what it has heard of NAFTA and the way the administration sold that deal politically, simply as a matter of extra exports and jobs. 
Less than a year after NAFTA came into force, and eight days after the Miami summit, Mexico's currency began to collapse. The United States not merely had to stump up billions (promptly repaid, but who remembers that?) to save its neighbour, but saw its 1994 trade surplus with Mexico of $5 billion become a deficit of $13 billion in each of the next two years. To the unions, increasingly influential backers of Mr Clinton's Democratic Party, this proved the folly of opening doors to low-wage economies. And to widen the grief, with Mexican goods came Mexican migrants and drugs. 
Latin America too is wobbling in its commitment to free trade, partly because Asia's troubles have tightened both capital and export markets. In November Mercosur, the incipient customs union linking Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, raised its common external tariff, which averaged around 12%, by three percentage points. This year Brazil has revived a few bad habits, demanding import licences for some goods and scrutinising invoices with punitive care. Even Chile, the region's paragon of open trade, which planned to cut its flat tariff from ti% to 8%, has not done so. 
Slow track, no track? 
So is the FTAA doomed? Not yet. Official and ministerial effort has been sunk into the project. The preparatory talks have given it some momentum. Whatever the doubts, no country has shown itself ready to abandon the project. And though Latin Americans are sceptical of negotiating with a president who lacks fast-track authority, it is, after all, at the end, not the start, of talks that that authority is required. 
Ironically, the lack of fast-track may have eased the launch of talks, by blunting American ideas of speeding them up. Brazil wants plenty of time to modernise its economy before embarking on open trade with the United States. To the Americans-and Central Americans hurt by exclusion from NAFTA while Mexico is inside-that smacks of protectionist foot-dragging. But Brazil, the third-largest economy in the Americas, could not easily have been overridden. 
By weakening the United States' negotiating position, lack of fast-track has also changed the shape of the talks. These will be no series of bilateral exercises, with Latin American countries competing against each other to join the queue for accession to NAFTA, as the Americans envisaged in Miami. Instead, in Costa Rica, the 34 countries agreed to a multilateral process. Different countries will preside over the nine negotiating groups (covering matters such as investment, services, competition policy and subsidies, as well as market access). The talks will start in Miami in June, moving in 2001 to Panama city and in 2003 to Mexico city. Canada will be the first chairman, then Argentina, Ecuador and, during the last two years (to the end of 2004) when the crucial deals will have to be cut, Brazil and the United States jointly. 
But will the United States still be interested? Instead of the ""early harvest"" of tariff cuts that it wanted by 2000, the negotiators will merely seek ""business facilitation"" steps by that date, such as standardised customs forms. If Mr Clinton fails to win fasttrack before his presidency ends in January 2001, the talks may slide into the dust. 
Even if the talks go well, to push them to a deal, and then to win legislative approval, will require governments-and not just in Washington-to show political courage. Although it would be phased in slowly, probably over 15 years after zoos, the FTAA would offend powerful domestic lobbies. 
It would demand demolition of the solid tariff walls still encircling Latin American countries. Tariffs there, though much lower than a decade ago, still average around 15%, and more than that on some significant products in some big countries; Brazil levies z9% on computers, and up to 49% on cars, for example. 
The United States' tariffs are lower; less than a fifth of Latin American exports there pay more than sY But many of the most competitive products face special duties or non-tariff barriers. Brazil's trade officials say barriers to its steel, orange juice, sugar, tobacco, footwear and other exports cost it up to $5 billion a year; hence its resistance to the American desire for early tariff cuts in isolation from an over-arching agreement on issues such as anti-dumping, dispute-settlement and subsidies. In an FTAA, the United States would have to slash at its protection of textiles, clothing and farm products. Some action on textiles is due anyway, under the GATT's Uruguay round. If new world trade talks looked likely to open agricultural markets (notably Europe's), to do that for Latin America would look less alarming. But, north and south alike, there would be cries of pain and rage. 
Open or shut 
With or without an FTAA, the pace of regional trade and integration in Latin America is likely to remain swift. The 199os have seen the rise of dynamic sub-regional groupings, and of growing links between them. Last year, trade within Mercosur, for example, grew by 25% to $20 billion; in 1990 it was $4 billion. The Andean Community (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela) recorded a double-digit rise in intra-group trade. So did the Central American Common Market (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) Caricom, the 15-country Caribbean common market (notably, Jamaica, Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname, Belize-and soon, probably, the Dominican Republic, bigger than any of these) is something of an odd man out: its real ambition is the ""NAFTA parity"" promised last year by Mr Clinton, and again this week by Madeleine Albright, but stalled in Congress. 
Mercosur already has a free-trade agreement with Chile. It has one with Bolivia, and is talking with the other Andean countries. This web of accords will complicate the FTAA negotiations, especially in the effort to mesh differing rules of origin. But so far most of these deals, on balance, have opened doors rather than closed them. 
While Mercosur consolidates, and pulls much of South America into its orbit, its policymakers are studying other options besides the FTAA. They have completed a preliminary, fact-finding study with the European Union, and negotiations aiming at a Mercosur-Eu free-trade deal may be launched at a first-ever summit of Latin American and Eu heads of government in Rio de Janeiro next year. 
These talks might be harder than those on the FTAA"" because of the EU'S farm protectionism. But the potential pay-off for Mercosur is attractive: a study by Brazil's Getulio Vargas Foundation suggests that a deal with the Eu would add more to growth in both Brazil and Argentina than would an FTAA. Whereas the rest of Latin America looks to the United States, the EU, taken as a whole, has long been Mercosur's biggest trading partner, and in 1996 displaced the United States as its largest source of foreign investment, according to calculations by IRELA, a Madrid-based think-tank. 
This suggests two possible outcomes after Santiago. One is that the FTAA talks gather momentum, stimulated partly by parallel negotiations between Mercosur and the Eu. A gloomier one is that, in the absence of fast-track, and of a business push for an FTAA., the talks drift nowhere. In that case, a relatively closed Mercosur (probably with Chile) might in the end go its own way, while the Andean countries, Central America and the Caribbean try to boost trade among themselves while still looking hopefully-and mainly-to NAFTA and, above all, its heart, the United States. ","SAO PAULO 
The second ""summit of the Americas"" opens in Chile next week. It will give formal approval to negotiations intended to lead to free trade from Alaska to Cape Horn. But that project needs broader political support 
WHEN in December 1994 Bill Clinton welcomed to Miami the leaders of 33 other countries in the Americas, their meeting was widely seen as the start of a new chapter in the often troubled relations between the United States and Latin America. With the cold war over, elected governments in power everywhere except (uninvited) Cuba, and with market reforms and freer trade supplanting statist protectionism, many old sources of tension seemed to have been replaced by shared ideas and new opportunities for co-operation. 
Chief among these was the notion, mooted earlier by President George Bush in 199o, of a ""free-trade area of the Americas"" (FTAA), stretching from Alaska to Cape Horn. In Miami, Latin America's leaders embraced the idea with surprising enthusiasm. A target date of 2005 was set for its achievement, with ""concrete progress"" to be made by 2000. Alongside this, the 34 summiteers put their names to a long list of collective virtue, 150 ""action items"" concerned with topics ranging from health services through women's rights to the environment. 
On April 18th and 19th in the Chilean capital, Santiago, the 34 countries' leaders meet again. They will formally launch the FTAA negotiations. After three years of hard talking, at a final preparatory meeting in Costa Rica last month their trade ministers agreed to a detailed agenda of what to negotiate, how, where and when. Their ambitious dream might seem, at first glance, to be steadily becoming a reality. 
True, the FTAA concept faces criticism. Some economists argue that regional preferences divert more trade than they create. Some Latin Americans fear that the cost of adjusting to free trade with the world's most powerful economy will far outweigh the benefits, especially in smaller and less developed countries. Trade unions in the United States express the opposite fear, foreseeing a flight of jobs to lower-wage countries farther south. 
Yet Latin American governments have concluded that they do want an FrA. Such studies as exist suggest that guaranteed access to the United States market would add to growth both by boosting exports, especially of manufactures, and by attracting extra foreign investment. And if an FTAA, comes to be, no country can afford to be left out. The United States can foresee corresponding benefits, as faster growth to its south boosts demand for its exports. Already, Latin American countries' unilateral lowering of trade barriers has made the region the United States' fastest-growing foreign market. Last year, Mexico overtook Japan to become the second-largest importer of United States goods, after Canada. The FTAA has a geopolitical attraction too: it would lock in free-marketry as the way of life throughout the Americas. 
Nor will trade be the only, or even the first, item on the Santiago agenda. The summit will discuss democracy, education and poverty; and, not least, drugs. Latin Americans resent the United States' practice of unilaterally ""certifying""-or decertifyingother countries as dependable allies in the war against drugs. Mr Clinton cannot just abandon this: it is enshrined in American law. But Santiago may be a first step toward parallel, multilateral monitoring of efforts to curb not just the (Latin American) supply of drugs, but the (United States') demand for them. And the assembled leaders may agree to make their summits regular, perhaps three-early, affairs. In sum, here, says Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, is ua mature partnership.""

BUDAPEST 
AFTER the first of two rounds of Hungary's general election on May loth, the outcome was blurred. The ruling (ex-communist) Socialists, led by the prime minister, Gyula Horn, topped the party-list part of the poll, with around 32% of the votes-a bit less than their score four years ago. But their coalition partner, the Free Democrats (liberals), slumped badly. By contrast, Fidesz, once a dissident student group but now a part of the conservative mainstream, and the right-wing rural populists of the Smallholders' Party both did notably well. 
Winning 28% of the partylist vote under its sharp young leader, Viktor Orban, Fidesz tripled its score and might, if it does well in the next round in the constituencies, get in range of building a big enough coalition to oust the Socialists. It is also conceivable that the Socialists might team up with Fidesz in a ""grand coalition"". Or the same team could hang on. The only certainty is that none of the above-mentioned parties-if their leaders mean what they say-will play with the chauvinists of the Justice and Life party, under Istvan Csurka, which increased its tally to 5.6% of valid party-list votes. 
Why did the Socialists not do better? After all, in four years of government they sloughed off their communist heritage while keeping their organisational network as well as the loyalty of poorer and elderly voters. At the same time they revived the economy and persuaded NATO and the European Union to invite Hungary in. Above all, Hungary's economy now looks in as good a state as any in the postcommunist world. 
Four years ago, it was distinctly rocky. The government was spending too much; the trade deficit looked out of control; the currency was wobbly. Goaded by foreign advisers and by their free-market partners in coalition, the Socialists reluctantly switched tack, slashing welfare spending and bravely discarding the protectionist nationalism that had inhibited reform in so many other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Banks, insurance companies, utilities and big chunks of industry were sold off, often to foreigners. 
The state's retreat and the advance of foreign investors have worked wonders. The current-account deficit has shrunk from 9.5% of GDP in 1994 to 2.2% last year, with foreign direct investment financing the gap. The economy is expected to grow by 5% this year. Thanks to the foreignowned firms that produce two-thirds of the goods that Hungary sells abroad, exports are driving the economy. Wages and living standards are both going up, though not fast enough to endanger competitiveness. Hungary has become the most western of East European economies. 
Mr Horn's was Europe's first post-communist government to begin replacing payas-you-go pensions, where taxpayers finance their parents' retirement, with pensions funded by the people who will benefit. Selling to foreigners has given Hungarians more than just western-quality goods to export; it has helped revamp its infrastructure and smartened up institutions such as regulators and bank supervisors. Hungary's telephone company, owned mainly by Americans and Germans, has cut the waiting-list for lines from 800,000 to 20,000 since 1993; in Poland, which has yet to sell off its telecoms, 2m people are in the queue. In the European Bank's latest economic report-card, Hungary comes top in all nine tests of progress, from privatisation to legal reform. Among the five East European countries set to join the Eu in the first intake, Hungary is now almost certainly the best qualified. 
But there have been lapses and lags-which is why the Socialists are far from home and dry in the election. Hungary's good fortune has been unevenly spread. Budapest and western parts of the country have had the lion's share of foreign investment People east of the Danube, tenuously linked to the rich west by 11 bridges, nine of them in Budapest, the capital, feel cut off. Even in industrial towns where Socialist traditions linger, new inequalities rankle and welfare cuts hurt. 
The have-nots' sense of grievance is sharpened by the whiff of corruption that surrounds both government and the economy. Hungary can sometimes feel like two countries: an open, competitive one where observance of the law and quality of products are nearly up to western snuff; and one where ties between commerce and politics are murky, the rule of law is weak, civil servants take bribes and everyone seems bent on dodging tax. Before the election, a sense of insecurity was added to resentment against the new elite when a series of bombs and grenades went off(without killing anyone), some near buildings owned or used by opposition politicians. 
Hence the voters' first-round ambivalence. But would a centre-right coalition based on Fidesz and the Smallholders deserve a chance in office? The two parties' leaders still have some explaining to do. Mr Orban, who seemed a thorough-going liberal until he took on a populist tinge in order to broaden his party's appeal, has promised to slash taxes, bolster welfare and make the economy grow by 7%, all without upsetting the trade balance: his figures baffle many economists. The Smallholders' fiery leader, Jozsef Torgyan, is more stridently nationalist-and still viscerally hostile to the Socialists because of their communist past. For instance, he opposes land sales to foreigners. Though they will back each other in the second round, Fidesz and the Smallholders share too little to make a coalition between them a happy one. 
The fear that centre-right rhetoric might become reality sent Hungarian stock prices down more than 8% this week. Still, as the Socialists discovered once in power, if Hungary is to knit itself more tightly to the West, foreign capital and the EU will continue to set much of the agenda. And most Hungarians, whoever ends up ruling them, seem bound for better things. ","Hungary may be the most successful of Europe 's post - communist countries .

A PREDICTABLE feature of the German publishing calendar in recent years has been the launch of new books billed as ""the long awaited unification novel"". The publishers' enthusiasm is understandable but so far no book has fulfilled the promise of the promotional blurb. 
Ingo Schulze, a young east German and the current darling of the critics, succeeds better than anybody has done so far by by passing the big drama. Instead, he tells the story of German unification through precise observation of the everyday lives of his characters. The great political maelstrom changes their brands of detergents and bathroom products, destroys some jobs and creates others, provides the thrill of foreign travel and so on. 
This matter-of-fact approach is accentuated by the setting of ""Simple Storys"": a provincial town in Saxony. A world away from the more exciting, and more excitable, city of Berlin-which is so often presented as the microcosm of unification-Altenburg offers the gritty realism of Main Street, east Germany. But though Mr Schulze chooses to hang close to his characters, he holds back from ever getting too involved with them. His style is detached, almost bloodless. The impression that sticks is the feeling of helplessness of his characters as big events wash over the lives of ""ordinary"" people. 
Readers of ""Short Cuts"" by Raymond Carver will recognise the style and the form of ""Simple Storys""-and understand why a German novel has been given a quasi-English title. Splintered into 29 separate tales, it is not a coherent narrative but rather a collection of interlocking stories with a core group of characters who flit in and out. 
The importing of a foreign style is not unusual for Mr Schulze. His first novel, ""33 Augenblicke des Glucks"" (33 moments of happiness), reviewed by The Economist on November lth 1995, was set in St Petersburg; its vivid portrayal of the whirligig of post-communist Russia was clearly influenced by the writings of Mikhail Bulgakov. 
With that book, published by Knopf in the United States and soon to be available from Macmillan in Britain, Mr Schulze made his mark as a young hopeful from the east along with Thomas Brussig. In a happy coincidence, Mr Brussig's bawdy and hilarious view of life under communism, ""`Helden wie wir"", has also just been published in English (by Farrar, Straus, Giroux in New York and Harvill in London), under the title ""Heroes Like Us"". 
The emergence of new talent from the east has given German publishers-who have long despaired of the ability of scribblers in the western part of the country to write novels which people might enjoy reading-something to be cheerful about. Another little-tapped resource might be Germany's minority communities, including those of Turkish origin. 
It is more than 30 years since the first ""guest workers"" were invited to western Germany to make up a shortfall in labour. But Turks living in Germany, and Germans with Turkish parents, have not yet made a significant impact on the country's mainstream culture. This is due in part to German prickliness about fully integrating a foreign minority. The migrants' ties to their homeland have been weakened, but they are still interlopers in Germany. 
This tension and the experience of moving between two cultures is the subject of Emine Sevgi Ozdamar's latest novel, ""Die Brucke vom goldenen Horn"" (the bridge of the Golden Horn), Set in Berlin and Turkey 30 or so years ago, it tells the story of a young girl living in a hostel for foreigners who dreams of being an actress as she works on a conveyor belt. Rich in imagery and rhythm, the novel is full of irony and revealing observation. In Berlin, students and other pampered radicals take to the well-paved streets to protest against the inhumanity of capitalism. In Turkey, where a peasant society is being catapulted into the 2oth century by American investment and cold-war logic, the poor go hungry and protesters get hurled out of windows. Ageing radicals might like to think west European cities were the most tumultuous places to be in the late 196os. Ms Ozdamar, who was born in Turkey and went on to work as an actress in Germany, suggests otherwise. 
Alexa Hennig von Lange has evidently explored other boundaries of expanded consciousness. Her ""Relax"" offers a quick gulp of German youth culture. With its drugs, music, parties and-yes-affairs of the heart, this may be little different from youth culture elsewhere in the West. But while writers such as Irvine Welsh, the Scottish author of ""Trainspotting"", have already introduced this to a wider audience, in Germany youth culture has remained largely a closed book. Ms von Lange, who has been dubbed literature's answer to the Spice Girls, saves her novel from sounding too condescending and portentous by injecting a heavy element of comedy into a book intended to upset the grown-ups. 
Against such a self-conscious display of girl power, Annemarie Schoenle's ""Frauen lugen besser"" (women are better liars) appears positively old-fashioned. It tells the story of three women who decide to get their own back on a male-dominated world with a publishing hoax. The result is much plucking of peacock feathers and a celebration of female powers of deception. It sounds very conventional satire but Ms Schoenle thrusts steel into her tale as she sends up the empty world of media folk addicted to sensation and lifestyle. It may not be as hip as a racy tale about a lost weekend of partying and drug-taking, but at 54 Ms Schoenle offers perhaps the wisdom of an older sister to 25-year-old Ms von Lange.

THE ""new leaders"" of Africa, the handful of rulers who were supposed to be cleaning up the continent and leading it into the 2lst century, are falling out with one another. In the Horn, the rulers of Eritrea and Ethiopia, once close allies in overthrowing the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991, are exchanging fire across their common border and talking of ""fullscale conflict"". In Central Africa, the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, which last year helped to launch Laurent Kabila to power in Congo (formerly Zaire), boycotted his regime's first birthday party last week. A preparty summit of 16 heads of state had to be abruptly cancelled. 
This is not at all the common approach to regional problems that is expected from the West's new allies in Africa. Susan Rice, in charge of Africa at America's State Department, has gone scuttling off to the continent to try to get some of these old friends to make up and be buddies again. 
""New leaders"" is an American-invented term for the military princes-such as Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi, and Eritrea's Issaias Afwerki-who have driven out the corrupt old rulers, such as Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, dubbed the ""toad kings"". In general, the new men have introduced market reforms plus a measure of democracy, though not on a western model. They seek to be on good terms with the West, particularly America, which would like their countries to be islands of stability and growth in a fragile continent. An African ""renaissance"" has been spoken of, perhaps too freely. 
The row between Ethiopia and Eritrea is surprising because of the close relations between their presidents. Mr Issaias's Eritrean nationalists supplied and fought alongside the Ethiopian rebels in the 1980s. After Mr Mengistu's fall, they engineered Eritrea's independence in the teeth of Ethiopian nationalism. Though this left Ethiopia landlocked, the two leaders managed the arrangement amicably, through regular meetings and telephone calls. 
Things began to go wrong last year when Eritrea launched its own currency, the nakfa. Unexpectedly, Ethiopia announced that trade between the two countries should be in hard currency. Then Eritrea expelled Ethiopian officials from the lifeline ports of Assab and Massawa. In return, Ethiopia expelled several thousand Eritreans from its north-western province. Telephone calls, this time, did not do the trick of producing harmony. Small border disputes broke out, culminating, on May 6th, in armed clashes. 
The disputed territory-remote but fertile and said to contain gold-is not the real issue. More important is the fact that Ethiopia, big, ancient and proud, has its main access to the outside world controlled by small, new, feisty Eritrea. This has snapped the bonds forged in war. 
Their quarrel has worrying implications for regional stability. Ethiopia and Eritrea are generally regarded as bastions of secular and sensible rule against chaotic Somalia to the east and Sudan's Islamist fundamentalism to the west. Both countries are also friendly towards Israel. Hence the dispatch of Ms Rice. 
The Americans are less concerned about Mr Kabila's spoilt party. They do not feel that Mr Kabila has yet earned a place in the new-leader club. The summit was supposed to bring together regional heads of state to discuss the continuing wars in eastern Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. But Uganda's Mr Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, refused. Personal pique played its part. Mr Kabila was once thought of as their puppet. No longer. 
The Banyamulenge people-Tutsis from eastern Congo who are close to the Rwandan and Ugandan regimes-used to be the backbone of Mr Kabila's army. But he has now got his own power-base and sent the Banyamulenge packing, undermining his relations with both countries. 
In addition, both Mr Museveni and Mr Kagame are fed up with what they see as Mr Kabila's erratic and ineffectual rule. They disagree with him on how to solve the regional wars. Congo, claim Uganda and Rwanda, is harbouring rebels who are trying to overthrow their governments. They want Mr Kabila to take a much harder line. All good reasons. But perhaps, above all, they cannot bear to see their protege up staging them in their own area.

AS law student in the mid-1980s, Viktor Orban wrote his thesis on Solidarity's battle against communism in Poland-a brave choice of topic, seeing that Hungary, and its universities, were ruled by communists at the time. Mr Orban may have recalled that provocative bit of scholarship as the votes were counted in the second (and final) round of Hungary's general election on May 24th. For Fidesz, the party he heads, was doing what Solidarity did in Poland last year: booting out a government led by ex-communists and replacing it with a coalition of the right. 
Is Mr Orban riding a conservative wave in Central Europe? It is tempting to think so. Poland and Hungary, the beefiest of the five countries that the European Union has invited to join it in the first batch from the continents post-communist side, have moved rightwards after a spell on the left. The Czechs have stayed on the right since the Warsaw Pact ended. Estonia, another of the EU's first-intake candidates, is againafter a brief hiccup-run by ardent freemarketeers who insist that Balts, despite their Soviet past, are Central rather than East Europeans: a state of mind more than geography. Slovenia, the remaining country in the advance-guard quintet, has added a right-wing component to a government led by pragmatic ex-communists (and has laid good claim to a place in that hard-to-define zone called Central Europe, since shedding its recent Balkan legacy in favour of its older Habsburg one). 
Elsewhere-in Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania-other right-of-centre parties have taken over. The bloodstained Balkans, with the old nationalist left still broadly ascendant, is an area on its own. And farther east, of course, in the Slav heartland, a mix of nostalgic leftists and quasi-fascist nationalists still has great clout, at least in parliaments. 
On paper, then, Central Europe has certainly seen a swing back to the right, after a leftward lurch of three or four years' duration in which the euphoria of anti-communist freedom evaporated amid the disillusion and trauma of transition. Yet it is hard to say that post-communist market economics, let alone liberalism, has won the day. The big switch is still painful and jerky. Ideology is only part of the reason for the rightward swing of the pendulum. 
Quite simply, voters in Central Europe do not like incompetence and corruption, and once they have voted one lot out, they tend to find the next lot just about as venal or out of touch. However successful reformers are, whether of centre-left or centreright, it takes time-given the appalling economic detritus of half a century in their way-for voters to enjoy the benefits. Good, especially radical, government is not readily rewarded. The pendulum could easily swing left again. 
Or perhaps it may settle nearer the middle, as voters become less impatient and more mature-and as centre-left and centre-right reformers seek the centre ground. Poland's current government is following similar policies to the previous one, which bequeathed its successor one of the fastestgrowing economies in Europe and wangled fast-track invitations to NATO and the EU. If, as is probable, the Czech right is beaten in a summer election, the Social Democrats will probably follow a broadly free-market course. The Hungarian Socialists, though tainted with corruption (like almost all post-communist governments), have done well. Mr Orban is likely to keep most of their policies. 
After all, Gyula Horn, Hungary's defeated prime minister, pulled Hungary back from a debt crisis, reformed pensions and engineered an impressive export- and investment-led recovery. Bad luck for him that so many Hungarian voters felt the pain of reform without enjoying its benefits. 
Mr Orban, for his part, has yet to convince investors and free-market economists that he will manage to continue Mr Horn's reforms without, like Mr Horn, disappointing the people who elected him. Foreign investors are important: they have put more money per person in Hungary than anywhere else in post-communist Europe. They produce two-thirds of exports, the growing economy's motor. Share prices dropped over 17% after the first round of the election on May loth, though they were recovering towards the end of this week. 
But Mr Orban, 35 on May 31st, is nothing if not adaptable. He was prominent in Fidesz when it was, in effect, the student wing ofthe Free Democrats, the junior(and more liberal) member of the defeated coalition. Yet he turned Fidesz into a party with mass appeal by sounding anything but liS eral. His economic pronouncements are tinged with demagoguery: taxes and inflation will be lower, he promises; growth faster; welfare more generous. He also champions the ethnic Hungarians living outside Hungary in ways that unnerve Romania and Slovakia, where most of them live. And he has rattled the Eu: for the sake of those Hungarian cousins, he has said, Hungary should not join the Eu's borderless Schengen area until they are in it too. And all good Hungarians should, like him, have three children. 
Will he jettison such populism, once in office? Much will depend on his partners. So far, he has derided the prospect of a ""grand coalition"" with the defeated Socialists. That leaves him with the rural Smallholders, who can sound even more populist than Mr Orban.They want to restore the death penalty. They would ban the sale of land to foreigners, making it harder for Hungary to join the EU. 
But the Smallholders' rank and file may be easier-going than their irascible nationalist leader, Jozsef Torgyan. Finding him a job that makes him feel good while curbing his influence, especially over the economy, is Mr Orban's biggest problem. But Mr Torgyan, like Mr Orban, may become more pragmatic in office. He is already toning down his language. And both men have refused to co-operate with Istvan Csurka, an out-and-out chauvinist, whose Justice and Life Party has for the first time won seatsalbeit only a handful-in parliament. 
Mr Orban has promised to leave in office the central bank's president, Gyorgyi Suranyi, widely seen as a guarantor of economic stability. A newspaper close to Fidesz has tipped as the likely finance minister Laszlo Urban, an American-trained economist with fiscally conservative instincts. The first clue to the new government's economic approach, and to the Smallholders' influence, will be the drafting of next year's budget, which begins within months. 
So the change may not be that big after all. And that, perhaps, reveals a real trend in Central Europe. After nearly a decade of pain and populism, with the worst of the transition over, voters and parties may be converging on a steadier, less hectic, phase of post-communist reform-with Poles and Hungarians showing the way.

However successful reformers are , whether of centre - left or centreright , it takes time - given the appalling economic detritus of half a century in their way - for voters to enjoy the benefits . Good , especially radical , government is not readily rewarded . The pendulum could easily swing left again . 
 Or perhaps it may settle nearer the middle , as voters become less impatient and more mature - and as centre - left and centre - right reformers seek the centre ground . Poland 's current government is following similar policies to the previous one , which bequeathed its successor one of the fastestgrowing economies in Europe and wangled fast - track invitations to NATO and the EU . If , as is probable , the Czech right is beaten in a summer election , the Social Democrats will probably follow a broadly free - market course . The Hungarian Socialists , though tainted with corruption ( like almost all post - communist governments ) , have done well . Mr Orban is likely to keep most of their policies . 
 After all , Gyula Horn's pulled Hungary back from a debt crisis , reformed pensions and engineered an impressive export- and investment - led recovery . Bad luck for Gyula Horn that so many Hungarian voters felt the pain of reform without enjoying its benefits . 
 Mr Orban , for his part , has yet to convince investors and free - market economists that he will manage to continue Gyula Horn's reforms without , like Gyula Horn , disappointing the people who elected him . Foreign investors are important : they have put more money per person in Hungary than anywhere else in post - communist Europe . They produce two - thirds of exports , the growing economy 's motor . Share prices dropped over 17 % after the first round of the election on May loth , though they were recovering towards the end of this week . 
 But Mr Orban , 35 on May 31st , is nothing if not adaptable . He was prominent in Fidesz when it was , in effect , the student wing ofthe Free Democrats , the junior(and more liberal ) member of the defeated coalition . Yet he turned Fidesz into a party with mass appeal by sounding anything but liS eral . His economic pronouncements are tinged with demagoguery : taxes and inflation will be lower , he promises ; growth faster ; welfare more generous . He also champions the ethnic Hungarians living outside Hungary in ways that unnerve Romania and Slovakia , where most of them live . And he has rattled the Eu : for the sake of those Hungarian cousins , he has said , Hungary should not join the Eu 's borderless Schengen area until they are in it too . And all good Hungarians should , like him , have three children . 
 Will he jettison such populism , once in office ? Much will depend on his partners . So far , he has derided the prospect of a "" grand coalition "" with the defeated Socialists . That leaves him with the rural Smallholders , who can sound even more populist than Mr Orban . They want to restore the death penalty . They would ban the sale of land to foreigners , making it harder for Hungary to join the EU . 
 But the Smallholders ' rank and file may be easier - going than their irascible nationalist leader , Jozsef Torgyan . Finding him a job that makes him feel good while curbing his influence , especially over the economy , is Mr Orban 's biggest problem . But Mr Torgyan , like Mr Orban , may become more pragmatic in office . He is already toning down his language . And both men have refused to co - operate with Istvan Csurka , an out - and - out chauvinist , whose Justice and Life Party has for the first time won seatsalbeit only a handful - in parliament . 
 Mr Orban has promised to leave in office the central bank 's president , Gyorgyi Suranyi , widely seen as a guarantor of economic stability . A newspaper close to Fidesz has tipped as the likely finance minister Laszlo Urban , an American - trained economist with fiscally conservative instincts . The first clue to the new government 's economic approach , and to the Smallholders ' influence , will be the drafting of next year 's budget , which begins within months . 
 So the change may not be that big after all . And that , perhaps , reveals a real trend in Central Europe . After nearly a decade of pain and populism , with the worst of the transition over , voters and parties may be converging on a steadier , less hectic , phase of post - communist reform - with Poles and Hungarians showing the way .",310,Hungary,A29-4558,IN TERM,True,"Gyula Horn , Hungary 's defeated prime minister ,",4,True

THE JAZZ SINGERS: A SMITHSONIAN COLLECTION OF JAZZ VOCALS FROM 1919-1994. The Smithsonian Collection of Recordings; $69.98 
TRADITIONALLY, vocalists have been the Cinderellas of jazz. Instrumentalists often accept them only grudgingly, since the measure of jazz distinction is the improvised solo, when a player throws caution to the winds, fashioning his own variations on a song while leaving the original melody far behind. But a singer's expressive potential seems confined to those very melodies. The only improvisatory option may be scat-singing, using ooby-dooby syllables like a quasi-horn. 
One of the virtues of Robert O'Meally's splendid compilation ""The Jazz Singers"" is that it addresses exactly these prejudices. In the notes accompanying the five-cD set, Mr O'Meally considers the special qualities that vocalists bring to jazz, which in his view actually place them at the centre of the music. After all, many of the key elements that fostered jazz in the beginning were vocal-the blues, spirituals and work songs among them. 
For players, the distinctive sound of jazz has derived not from acquiring a conventional classical technique on an instrument, but from emulating the spontaneous twists and turns of an impassioned voice. 
Even now, jazz musicians describe their art in vocal terms. The essence of a true jazz sonority is its ""cry"". It must be personal and individual; as a jazzman put it, ""Everyone must know your voice"". Similarly, an effective solo is one that ""says something"". 
Conversely, as Mr O'Meally points out, the best jazz singers use their voices like instrumentalists. The great Billie Holiday said she thought of herself as a horn when she delivered a tune, reshaping melody and words to increase their impact. Indeed, to Mr O'Meally, jazz consists of ""voice-like horns and horn-like voices"", and he finally insists that in terms of effect, jazz vocalists may have the edge over musicians-that the singing voice may be ""jazz's most articulately expressive, subtly flexible and hard-swinging instrument"". 
His compilation may tempt some listeners to agree with him. A professor of literature at Columbia University, he intends it as a kind of ""seminar"" to encourage new perspectives, with a list of selections ""more provocative than definitive"". Certain purists may raise their eyebrows at the inclusion of the likes of Marvin Gaye and Aretha Franklin, but the influences they share with the jazz mainstream give them credibility, and no one will disagree with the bulk of the stars represented. 
Fittingly, Louis Armstrong appears more than anyone else, on seven tracks, an accurate index of his seminal importance as both singer and player. Second in frequency comes Billie Holiday, in both her early ""sing and swing"" guise and later persona as tragic chanteuse. The two performances by Bessie Smith may puzzle devo tees-both come from her somewhat roughvoiced sessions in the 1930s, instead of her majestic work in the 1920s. 
But for artistic scope and sheer entertainment, the set is a delight. It is also fair, balanced and comprehensive. Though jazz fans are always prone to deplore the omission of personal favourites, the most obvious gap in Mr O'Meally's assortment is not his fault: Ray Charles's managers apparently refused permission for his work to be included. For the rest, older connoisseurs may only regret the absence of the smokyvoiced Lee Wiley, who created some effortless masterpieces with Eddie Condon's dixieland circle. 
Mr O'Meally's sense of category is as finely tuned as his instinct for good singing. Ranging from 1919 to 1994, the set is divided into sections on the blues, church roots, party songs, standard tunes (slow and up-tempo), jazz originals, scat-singing and novelties, though the compiler acknowledges that many of his pieces overlap their pigeonholes. Here are the pleasures any jazz lover would expect-elegant scatting from Ella Fitzgerald, an incomparably rich Ellington ballad by Sarah Vaughan, and Jimmy Rushing shouting the blues. 
But there is special pleasure in the unexpected. Bandleader Don Redman, in 1931, half-talks his own ""Shakin' the African"" with a hip panache which makes today's rappers seem mechanical, manic and obvious; the nonpareil tenor saxophonist Lester Young makes an amiably salacious, one-off appearance as a vocalist. 
Most daringly, there is a performance by another tenor giant, Ben Webster, which is strictly speaking not a vocal at all, but a recording of Webster rehearsing a big band in one of his own compositions. As he exhorts the musicians, Webster scats, sings, preaches and cajoles, delivering a pure object lesson in the inventiveness and passion of the jazz voice. ","Jazz singers Scatty delight

SIR-Jeffrey Sachs (September 12th) rightly identifies the ims fatal flaws: secrecy; arbitrary politics; the quixotic expectation that groups of experts are able to micro-manage an immeasurably vast range of differing local economic conditions; and the abject failure of bailouts predicated on sham conditionality. His criticism of the World Bank, and foreign aid in general, is trenchant.

SIR--I agree with Mr Sachs's opinions of IMF agreements. As an adviser to Venezuela's president, Jaime Luschini, between 1984 and 19881 contributed to his conviction not to adopt the negative IMF policies proposed to him. Following more conventional business-oriented policies, his government signed the 1984 and 1987 debt restructurings without an IMF accord. Between 1984 and 1988 the average annual rate of inflation was 14.5%, of devaluation 143% and of economic growth 3.2%. 
A more mixed populist and antibusiness stance of 1994-98 was combined with IMF policies. It yielded comparable figures of 52% inflation, 37% devaluation and 0.5% growth. The contrast is even more telling as foreign-- exchange inflows from oil exports, privatisations and new debt issues were 70% greater than during Mr Luschini's time. 
During its early days the IMF allowed and even promoted very different options regarding exchange rates and capital flows. Now it demands that central banks support exchange rates at any cost. Private enterprise rebuilt Europe after the second world war. Control and regulation of capital accounts, and financial and banking systems were maintained by individual countries with the acceptance and support of the IMF. It may be worth adopting similar policies to transform and rebuild former communist countries.

SIR-The claim by Brian Leary that the BBC'S nine o'clock news only rarely covers foreign news items ""other than disasters, atrocities and sex scandals"" is not true. The ""Nine"" dedicates as much air time to foreign stories today as it did 20 years ago. On average a third of the programme is taken up with stories from around the globe and these days they tend to be longer to better explain more complex issues. 
Indeed, while many broadcasters now rely on agencies to supply foreign news, the number of BBC news correspondents and bureaux around the world has increased in order to provide accurate on-the-ground coverage that can be rivalled by no other broadcaster.

SIR-Your article on the encroachment of American culture on the rest ofthe world (""Culture wars"", September 12th) misses the main point. Starting in the 1920s, America has developed a uniquely marketing-based culture. In particular, its broadcast media remain the only ones in the world that are virtually loo% commercially controlled. The content, including even the news, is designed primarily to attract audiences for advertisements. American cinema also promotes consumption through product placement, commercial tie-ins and the celebration of consumption-laden lifestyles. 
Until the advent of American marketing culture, all human societies involved values that constrained choice and individual appetites in the interest of social harmony; for example, the Ten Commandments. 
Consumerism rests on its own distinct set of values, particularly unlimited freedom of choice and the expectation of customer satisfaction. Administered to adults in moderate amounts, it may not be harmful. However, delivered to children at the American dosage-level it has the effect of undermining all other value systems. The erosive effect of American media on more traditional values is well understood among those facing the onslaught, if not by The Economist. Given the state of American morals, manners, values, education and waistlines after 70-odd years of indoctrination by commercial mass media, one can sympathise with the nations trying to resist the campaign to train their children to be American-style consumers.

Holocaust-era insurance 
SIR--It is not true that the Czech government has ""stayed mum"" over Holocaust-era insurance policies (September 5th). Since May the Czech Republic has created a working coalition between numerous ministries and the Czech Federation of Jewish Communities, under the direction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This coalition is currently conducting a full investigation of Holocaust-era insurance claims in the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in America. In June, preliminary findings were presented at the Washington conference on Holocaust-era assets, hosted by the State Department. According to these findings, the insurance policies of Holocaust victims residing in the German-occupied territories of what is now the Czech Republic were confiscated by the Third Reich before the end of the second world war. Neither the Czech Republic nor the Holocaust victims from this region have ever received any compensation for these policies.

But who will tell the reader what portion is fact and what fantasy Since such clarification is never provided in science fiction, a sub-genre, science in fiction, is more than justified.

SIR-I am baffled by the government's lack of thought about reforming the British constitution (September 12th). Reform of the House of Lords, not minor adjustments to the role of the monarchy, is the linchpin of any future constitutional structure 
In any serious democracy the second chamber is elected, and usually based, on regional representation. Regional elected assemblies already exist for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. If England had its own assembly, the House of Lords could act as a regional assembly like the Bundesrat. 
Reform of election to the Lords is more than 700 years overdue. In 1258 Simon de Montfort went to war with Henry III. De Monfort argued that royal patronage ought to be in the hands of a council, not the king. Although royal patronage has passed to the prime minister it is still abused. Maybe it is time to ride up to Downing Street with unsheathed swords, declare war on the Labour government and its ""over-- patronised friends"" and so get what Britain deserves: a democratically elected second chamber.

Ownership of the Mauritian economy has been diversified over the past 15 years, with an increasing share going to Indo-Mauritians. Price increases have arisen mainly from a continuous depreciation of the Mauritian rupee since January and have been enhanced by a 10% vAT levy, the introduction of which was badly planned and judged, ill-timed and covered too wide a range of commercial activities.

SIR-Your otherwise thorough survey on the millennium bug (September 19th) propagates the myth that the computer age brought in the practice of leaving the ""19"" off the year of calendar dates. In fact, this practice was universal in the punched-card industry in the 1950s and for decades earlier. It would have been absurd not to have dropped those digits when designing unit records to be fitted into the 80 or 90 columns of a card. 
Programs coded for the first electronic computers brought into commercial use merely copied the less automatic procedures used with older, simpler punched-card machinery. Those early computers processed cards formated to old designs and still produced and partly processed on the older machinery. 
The millennium bug is only a minor example of a general, historical tolerance of second-rate computation, and gets major attention only because most of its effect is going to be felt on a single day by many people. 
Dilston, Australia 
NEVILLE HOLMES 
SIR-You say, regarding the millennium bug, that ""all sorts of functions that depend on dates will... go wrong, but in ways that are hard to forecast."" In truth, only a small fraction of computer functions depends on dates. These functions are quite identifiable and the ways in which they will go wrong are extremely easy to forecast. Certain methods of calculating age and duration, and before-and-after decisions involving the year, will be affected. The wrong results they will report, if comparing 99 to zero, are completely predictable. 
There is no believable scenario whereby one ofthese incorrect results could crash even a single program, let alone an entire system. The truth is that many or most of the computer functions involving yearly date checks have already""failed""with no discernible consequences. For instance, almost every program that calculates credit-card expiration dates has already passed through one day (or one hour) when it rejected cards expiring in the 21st century. It was quickly and easily fixed, and the rejected cards reprocessed. A momentary embarrassment, perhaps, but hardly the end of the world.

SIR-My own awakening to the potential millennium bug problem occurred in the late 1970s when I was a junior programmer put on to a project to convert applications from one mainframe to another. As the programs were mostly written in the early 1960s, I realised the long lifecycle of these systems could cause problems around the year 2000. The problem was discussed and resolved-not only internally in the software house where I was employed but also in several industry forums in Britain and America. 
Since then, four-digit years in all new or reworked applications has been a strict rule. When I read that some organisation in Japan ""proposed"" this solution as late as 1992, I did not know whether to laugh or cry.

However, as the waters rose and the intensity of the disaster became all too obvious, the government lost hardly a moment to acquaint the outside world with the news of the crisis. Finally, to suggest that foreign pressure was brought to bear on the government in the matter of distribution of aid is unkind.

We are often asked why CERN did not take out patents for the Web. What we did was to produce a standard; we wanted to leave the production of software to industry. The real question is: why did European industry fail to pick up the Web when we were pushing them and giving away prototype software for exactly that purpose?

Neutral observation 
SIR-I am forced to respond to claims made by J.M.Amir, the Malaysian high commissioner in London (Letters, September l9th), who states that the presence of Amnesty International at the trial of an opposition parliamentarian, Lim Guan Eng, demonstrates that the Malaysian justice system is fair and open. The presence of a neutral observer, a minimum requirement of international human-rights standards, indicates only that the trial is open and in no way ensures that a fair trial is administered. 
The truth of the matter is that Amnesty International believes that the government of Malaysia continues to apply restrictive legislation in an arbitrary and selective manner. This belief is reinforced by the recent arrest of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and his political associates. 
Amnesty International believes that the imprisonment of Mr Lim, who is deputy secretarygeneral of the Democratic Action Party, is politically motivated and that the aim of the prosecution was to remove a prominent government critic from public life (the sentence automatically disqualifies him from Parliament). We believe Mr Lim, Mr Anwar and his detained associates are prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions, and call for their immediate and unconditional release.

Moral authority 
SIR-Lexington (September 12th) writes of Senator Joe Lieberman that ""his political persona exudes integrity and strict moral values."" Before Mr Lieberman is anointed the moral custodian of the Senate, a broader, secular definition of morality is needed. 
Year after year, Mr Lieberman has pressed for product liability legislation that restricts the recovery rights of wrongfully injured people in courts of law against the perpetrators. He has also voted for legislation that makes it much more difficult for defrauded investors to hold corporate chisellers accountable in state and federal courts. 
While taking away rights held for decades by Americans when suing corporations, Mr Lieberman protects the corporations' right to sue. Companies are exempted from the restrictions imposed on injured human beings and are left with unfettered rights to obtain full compensation for their commercial losses from defective products, including punitive damages without statutory limits. Also, in the past, Mr Lieberman has proposed more Draconian tort-law restrictions than were contained in the bill which the Senate defeated in July. 
Will commentators ever get round to evaluating this kind of legislative immorality against defenceless children and adults who become victims of reckless or criminal behaviour by car, drug, chemical, securities and insurance companies? And by the way, much of Mr Lieberman's campaign contributions comes from the very special interests that he champions. 
Washington, DC RALPH NADER 
Don't cry for Argentina 
SIR-The view from Argentina of the links with Brazil is quite different from the one that you portray (September 12th). First, there is confidence that Brazil will not radically change monetary or exchange-rate policy, given its hard-won fight against inflation and the political capital the government has invested in stability. Second, the growing insider view is that even if it did, this would not unduly affect Argentina as: 
Though almost 30% of Argentine exports go to Brazil, total exports are less than 8% of GDP, and some so% of exports to Brazil are commodities that would find other markets at going international prices. Even an unthinkable disaster in Brazil would cost Argentina no more than, say, 1% Of GDP. 
Brazilian and Argentine growth rates are not linked. Argentina grewby7.2% in the first quarter of 1998, Brazil by 1.1%; second-quarter figures for Argentina showed continued strong growth of 6.9%. This makes perfect sense, given the marked difference in real interest rates in the two countries. 
The Argentine peso appreciated by 53% between 1990 and 1992 against the Brazilian currency. Then, with the reduction of inflation in Argentina and the start of the real plan it was Brazil's turn to appreciate, by 35% until November 1994. Thereafter Brazil has been slowly gaining competitiveness against Argentina. Yet, notwithstanding these sharp movements in the real exchange-rate, trade between the two has been growing steadily in both directions, and Argentine exports to Brazil have grown strongly over the whole period. 
Although growing, integration between the two countries remains low and very large swings in real exchange rates have not had undue effects. So, the ""Brazil dependency"" myth is contagion at its worst It has no basis in the fundamentals. But if everyone thinks it is true, it would surely imply a reduction in finance available, an increase in the risk premium and lower growth-as this is the way Argentina would adjust. 
Your normally excellent newspaper has a reputation for focusing on the real facts and debunking such myths. What a shame The Economist simply reinforced contagion in this case, where it is so clear that the emperor has no clothes.

SRI-:Contrary to what you say in your article about Ethiopia and Eritrea (September 19th), it was Ethiopia that launched the first aerial attack against Eritrea. This was verified by several members of the diplomatic corps. Also, the borders of Eritrea-the ones that it inherited from Italian colonial rule-have already been estaS lished by international treaties concluded between Italy and Ethiopia. This boundary is probably the most clearly defined in Africa. 
Only Ethiopia is committing violations of human rights, both against Eritreans and against Ethiopians of Eritrean origin, amounting to ethnic cleansing. No third party has yet accused Eritrea of violations of human rights. Finally, the reports of Eritrean assistance to Ethiopian rebel movements are based on Ethiopian allegations.

Cause or correlation SIR-Andrew Oswald is wrong to draw attention to the nature of the housing market as a factor in youth unemployment in industrialised countries solely on the basis of correlation (Letters, September 5th). Correlation does not imply causality; plant growth rates may be strongly correlated with ice-cream sales but both are caused by good weather. Correlation analysis should be used to support a model chosen on economic grounds. In this case the most rational model implies a direction of causality opposite to that suggested: younger people are more likely to rent, but only if they can afford to do so(for example, when employed) 
Without proposing a reason to explain why youth unemployment should depend on the nature of the housing market Mr Oswald has done nothing more than point out a mathematical quirk. Such argument has no place in economics.

SIR-Your article ""Iran's war on fundamentalism"" (September 12th) could well have been titled ""Fundamentalism's war on Iran"". Conservative clergy feel their grip on Iranian society is loosening and may resort to war to restore their absolute power. 
Iran's clergy find themselves in a unique position. They are no longer martyrs, suffering because of the government: they are the government and their words have started to ring hollow. In the past, the clergy kept their word when they promised to fight against the monarchy (often risking their own lives). Today they have failed to make things better for ordinary Iranians. To make things worse, they have a new generation of students on their hands. These do not remember the martyrdom of the clergy but have seen the vigilantes' sticks, food stamps, and their elder brothers going to war with Iraq with the blessing of the clergynever to return from it. 
That is why things are happening in Iran which could never have happened in the first years after the revolution: the election of a president who, shortly before the election, lost his post as a minister due to the clergy's pressure and huge demonstrations in support of this president. 
In the light of the above, the events described in your article look like an act of despair on the part of the fundamentalists.

SIR-Bagehot (September 26th) discusses the prospects for Scottish independence. Were this to occur, we estimate that the basic rate of income tax in England could be reduced by 2p in the pound. This estimate is based on Treasury figures for 1994-95-the most recent available-and allocates the whole of North Sea oil revenue to Scotland. 
The prospect of tax cuts in England is not sufficient reason to let Scotland go; there is more to life than the basic rate of income tax. But English taxpayers might ponder on whether it is appropriate for them to help finance public spending in Scotland, which is one-sixth higher per head than it is in England.

Home truths 
SIR-As your leader on domestic services suggests (""Jeeves strikes it rich"", September 26th), some lost souls may well still believe that lawyers are more productive for society at the bar than do-it-yourselfing at home. After LTCM, only those firmly fixed in limbo can still believe that Nobel-winning economists would not do us all a favour by staying at home reading Galbraith by the fire. 
Briennon France MURRAY LIDDELL ","Taking the year out 
SIR-Your otherwise thorough survey on the millennium bug (September 19th) propagates the myth that the computer age brought in the practice of leaving the ""19"" off the year of calendar dates. In fact, this practice was universal in the punched-card industry in the 1950s and for decades earlier. It would have been absurd not to have dropped those digits when designing unit records to be fitted into the 80 or 90 columns of a card. 
Programs coded for the first electronic computers brought into commercial use merely copied the less automatic procedures used with older, simpler punched-card machinery. Those early computers processed cards formated to old designs and still produced and partly processed on the older machinery. 
The millennium bug is only a minor example of a general, historical tolerance of second-rate computation, and gets major attention only because most of its effect is going to be felt on a single day by many people. 
Dilston, Australia 
NEVILLE HOLMES 
SIR-You say, regarding the millennium bug, that ""all sorts of functions that depend on dates will... go wrong, but in ways that are hard to forecast."" In truth, only a small fraction of computer functions depends on dates. These functions are quite identifiable and the ways in which they will go wrong are extremely easy to forecast. Certain methods of calculating age and duration, and before-and-after decisions involving the year, will be affected. The wrong results they will report, if comparing 99 to zero, are completely predictable. 
There is no believable scenario whereby one ofthese incorrect results could crash even a single program, let alone an entire system. The truth is that many or most of the computer functions involving yearly date checks have already""failed""with no discernible consequences. For instance, almost every program that calculates credit-card expiration dates has already passed through one day (or one hour) when it rejected cards expiring in the 21st century. It was quickly and easily fixed, and the rejected cards reprocessed. A momentary embarrassment, perhaps, but hardly the end of the world.

JEFF CARLOCK 
SIR-My own awakening to the potential millennium bug problem occurred in the late 1970s when I was a junior programmer put on to a project to convert applications from one mainframe to another. As the programs were mostly written in the early 1960s, I realised the long lifecycle of these systems could cause problems around the year 2000. The problem was discussed and resolved-not only internally in the software house where I was employed but also in several industry forums in Britain and America. 
Since then, four-digit years in all new or reworked applications has been a strict rule. When I read that some organisation in Japan ""proposed"" this solution as late as 1992, I did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Flood warning 
SIR-You certainly deserve our thanks for highlighting the terrible nature of the floods which this year have laid waste to huge parts of Bangladesh (""Drowning"", September 12thy But there was no reluctance on the part of the authorities where calling for outside help was concerned, as you suggest Initially, it remained the endeavour of the government to deal with the emerging flood problem through its own measures and machinery. 
However, as the waters rose and the intensity of the disaster became all too obvious, the government lost hardly a moment to acquaint the outside world with the news of the crisis. Finally, to suggest that foreign pressure was brought to bear on the government in the matter of distribution of aid is unkind.

Spinning the Web 
SIR-You say that ""CERN was widely criticised for inventing the World Wide Web and then failing to cash in on it,"" (""Vacuum science: a stronger suck"", September 12th). This is pure nonsense. We were never criticised. 
We are often asked why CERN did not take out patents for the Web. What we did was to produce a standard; we wanted to leave the production of software to industry. The real question is: why did European industry fail to pick up the Web when we were pushing them and giving away prototype software for exactly that purpose?

Neutral observation 
SIR-I am forced to respond to claims made by J.M.Amir, the Malaysian high commissioner in London (Letters, September l9th), who states that the presence of Amnesty International at the trial of an opposition parliamentarian, Lim Guan Eng, demonstrates that the Malaysian justice system is fair and open. The presence of a neutral observer, a minimum requirement of international human-rights standards, indicates only that the trial is open and in no way ensures that a fair trial is administered. 
The truth of the matter is that Amnesty International believes that the government of Malaysia continues to apply restrictive legislation in an arbitrary and selective manner. This belief is reinforced by the recent arrest of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and his political associates. 
Amnesty International believes that the imprisonment of Mr Lim, who is deputy secretarygeneral of the Democratic Action Party, is politically motivated and that the aim of the prosecution was to remove a prominent government critic from public life (the sentence automatically disqualifies him from Parliament). We believe Mr Lim, Mr Anwar and his detained associates are prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions, and call for their immediate and unconditional release. 
DAVID BULL Director London Amnesty International UK 
Moral authority 
SIR-Lexington (September 12th) writes of Senator Joe Lieberman that ""his political persona exudes integrity and strict moral values."" Before Mr Lieberman is anointed the moral custodian of the Senate, a broader, secular definition of morality is needed. 
Year after year, Mr Lieberman has pressed for product liability legislation that restricts the recovery rights of wrongfully injured people in courts of law against the perpetrators. He has also voted for legislation that makes it much more difficult for defrauded investors to hold corporate chisellers accountable in state and federal courts. 
While taking away rights held for decades by Americans when suing corporations, Mr Lieberman protects the corporations' right to sue. Companies are exempted from the restrictions imposed on injured human beings and are left with unfettered rights to obtain full compensation for their commercial losses from defective products, including punitive damages without statutory limits. Also, in the past, Mr Lieberman has proposed more Draconian tort-law restrictions than were contained in the bill which the Senate defeated in July. 
Will commentators ever get round to evaluating this kind of legislative immorality against defenceless children and adults who become victims of reckless or criminal behaviour by car, drug, chemical, securities and insurance companies? And by the way, much of Mr Lieberman's campaign contributions comes from the very special interests that he champions. 
Washington, DC RALPH NADER 
Don't cry for Argentina 
SIR-The view from Argentina of the links with Brazil is quite different from the one that you portray (September 12th). First, there is confidence that Brazil will not radically change monetary or exchange-rate policy, given its hard-won fight against inflation and the political capital the government has invested in stability. Second, the growing insider view is that even if it did, this would not unduly affect Argentina as: 
Though almost 30% of Argentine exports go to Brazil, total exports are less than 8% of GDP, and some so% of exports to Brazil are commodities that would find other markets at going international prices. Even an unthinkable disaster in Brazil would cost Argentina no more than, say, 1% Of GDP. 
Brazilian and Argentine growth rates are not linked. Argentina grewby7.2% in the first quarter of 1998, Brazil by 1.1%; second-quarter figures for Argentina showed continued strong growth of 6.9%. This makes perfect sense, given the marked difference in real interest rates in the two countries. 
The Argentine peso appreciated by 53% between 1990 and 1992 against the Brazilian currency. Then, with the reduction of inflation in Argentina and the start of the real plan it was Brazil's turn to appreciate, by 35% until November 1994. Thereafter Brazil has been slowly gaining competitiveness against Argentina. Yet, notwithstanding these sharp movements in the real exchange-rate, trade between the two has been growing steadily in both directions, and Argentine exports to Brazil have grown strongly over the whole period. 
Although growing, integration between the two countries remains low and very large swings in real exchange rates have not had undue effects. So, the ""Brazil dependency"" myth is contagion at its worst It has no basis in the fundamentals. But if everyone thinks it is true, it would surely imply a reduction in finance available, an increase in the risk premium and lower growth-as this is the way Argentina would adjust. 
Your normally excellent newspaper has a reputation for focusing on the real facts and debunking such myths. What a shame The Economist simply reinforced contagion in this case, where it is so clear that the emperor has no clothes.

1998-12-19,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224093534/fulltext/A3AA7E9372C44A6CPQ/9?accountid=14657,"Borders are arbitrary abstractions, economic impediments and surprisingly ineradicable 
TODAY, the junction of Friedrichstrasse and Zimmerstrasse is just another Berlin construction site. On one side there is a billboard for Cheez Ums; on the other a banner for an Internet company proclaims the merits of ""least-cost routing"". People and cars move by regardless. 
Yet until recently Checkpoint Charlie was a monument to ""highest-price routing""-the place where East Germans seemed willing to pay any penalty as they dug, bullied, jumped, tricked or charged their way across the border. Some 2oo died in the attempt. From a table in Cafe Adler-once the gateway to freedom, now just another Berlin bar-you cannot help but feel that the march towards a ""borderless world"" is proceeding briskly. Thanks to the Schengen agreement between the countries at the heart of the EU, you could drive your Mercedes from here to Seville without so much as being looked at by a border guard. And Europe is not alone. In North America, politicians are talking about building borderless trade corridors ""from Murmansk to Monterrey"" along which you could drive a Freightliner truck made by the same world-straddling company as your Mercedes. Even in Asia, the bamboo curtain around China is gradually letting in light. And as every student of globalisation knows, money and power now leap across what frontiers are left at the touch of a button. 
But it is almost as though international politics obeyed some strange principle of the conservation of finitude: as some borders fall, so others rise. To see this principle at work, take your cup of coffee 700km east to Georgy Kusnitsov's office overlooking the windswept bridge between Narva and Ivangorod. Seven years ago the two predominantly Russian-speaking cities were part of the same country, sharing the same transport system, schools and hospital. Now Narva is the frontier town of Estonia, a fiercely independent Baltic republic. Mr Kusnitsov is the head of Ivangorod's border guards, and would welcome some nice Berlin coffee. 
Narva is not only in a different time zone to Ivangorod, but also in a different economic one. Every day, hundreds of elderly Russian-speaking Narvans cross the bridge from Estonia to go shopping in Ivangorod's shabby market. They look tired and defeated: most were dumped in the region by Soviet planners. The windy trek, moan the old ladies, is necessitated by the small pensions the Estonians pay them. One shows a jar of honey-her only purchase-which costs only seven Estonian crowns in Ivangorod (a fifth of the price in Narva). When will this all be alleviated? ""As soon as Boris Yeltsin lies under these waves,"" spits out one crone, pointing to the torrent below. 
The Estonian border-or, as some Estonians like to call it, the future eastern border of the EU-sometimes has a quaint, Tintin-like feel. In some of the rural border towers, the cash-strapped Russians parade only crude mannequins dressed up in soldiers' uniforms. In Moscow, politicians claim that it is a thoroughfare for drugs and guns. Not so, say the local border guards, who have found only the odd ounce of marijuana. Nevertheless, the sleeper from St Petersburg to Tallinn often wastes four hours at the border as guards and dogs pour through the train, turning over suitcases. Russian troops close to Estonia recently carried out a war game in which they took over a small country; it was called ""Operation Return"". Russian miners are threatening to block the border at Narva if Estonia does not buy their oil shale. ""All a country's problems end up at the border,"" laments Mr Kusnitsov. ""We are the sharp edge."" 
The art of the state 
Every distinction in human life can be treated as a border, from that between present and past (""a foreign country"") to that between self and other (""get off of my cloud"") to that between life and death (""from whose bourn no traveller returns""). However, this article will take borders fairly literally as the edges of states-and, as such, the underpinning of international politics. ""The frontier is the basic political institution,"" argues Malcolm Anderson in his comprehensive guide to borders (""Frontiers: Territory and State Formation in The Modern World"", Polity Press, 1996). ""No rule-bound economic, social or political life could be organised without them."" 
Whereas nations and peoples can be defined through histories or culture, states are a matter of geography. Nations can exist without states (the Palestinians) or between states (the Kurds or Basques). A state can contain many nations (Austro-Hungary), a part of a nation (Ireland) or no nation (the Vatican). But however many nations are involved, without a border you can have no state at all. 
A feeling of unfairness hangs around borders almost as often as uniformed guards do; the distinction between nation and state, between history and power, is often its source. European bureaucrats casually agglomerated perhaps 10,000 different African tribes and nations into just a few dozen colonial almost-states. In the area between Germany and Russia borders have flowed back and forth like rivers over flood plains. In her entertaining book on the region (""Between East and West"", Pantheon, 1994) Anne Applebaum points out that there are people born in Poland, brought up in the Soviet Union and now living in Belarus who have never left their native villages. Ukraine gets its name from Okrainy, the Russian for borderlands. 
Take the border Mr Kusnitsov guards. Some in Narva still think of the land beyond Ivangorod as their own. In Moscow, Alexei Mitrofanov, foreign-affairs spokesman for the far-right Liberal Party, complains that the border was created by trickery, and its barring of Russia's access to the Baltic Sea is like ""taking away the gates to your own home"". His idea of Russia would include not just Narva, but Belarus, most of the Ukraine and northern Kazakhstan. Mr Mitrofanov is careful to talk about referendums, integration on a bilateral basis, and the importance of persuasion. But the Estonians and Russia's other neighbours are justifiably jumpy. Most of Russia's leaders, including the prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, have made hostile noises about their Baltic borders. 
Africa and Eastern Europe may be particularly messy; but every region of the world has its disputes. Many of the borders in Asia-including those between China and Russia, India and Pakistan, and the two Koreas-are disputed. In Latin America, Argentina nearly went to war with Chile in 1978 over its southern tip and did go to war with Britain in 1982 over the Falklands. Peru and Ecuador recently signed a peace agreement over the border that sparked a minor war in 1995. 
Every time a border shifts, you can be sure that someone will want to shift it back, and claim precedent on their side. Saddam Hussein cited obscure reasons to do with the Ottoman empire for grabbing Kuwait; some Israelis maintain that the west bank of the Jordan is theirs because the Bible says so. In the Balkans it sometimes seems that every village can be turned into a casus belli. 
In fact, though, borders shift comparatively rarely. This is in part because changing them rarely quietens old conflicts down enough to make up for the new ones it sets in motion. And in general all states disapprove of changing any state's edges. Despite all that Serbia has done to the inhabitants of Kosovo, countries as far afield as China have worried about the precedent that an independent Kosovo would set. 
So borders, like rivers, tend to stick in their places, doing damage when they wander. At the same time, like rivers, borders can be high or low, easily fordable or hard to bridge. Anybody caring to find out about Enver Hoxha's Albania needed only to know that its guards occasionally took pot shots at bathers across the border. The best introduction to modem China is the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border, where British troops and Chinese red guards once glared at each other, but where now it is hard to tell whose glitzy skyscraper belongs to which side of the line. Virtually every country in the world seems to be building a bridge, a road or a tunnel to its neighbour. Estonia, for instance, wants to build a ""Via Baltica"" linking it to Finland and Latvia. 
Jeux sans frontieres 
Some groups have always hated borders. Religions tend to be against them-the papacy once disliked nationalism just as much as some of Islam does today. So do classical economists and, in principle, communists. (In practice, though, Stalin did not erase the lines on his maps, playing with them instead like a spiteful child.) Today the border is under attack from more prosaic people: businessmen and bureaucrats. 
Economics has always eaten away at political divisions. While Greek Cypriot guards in Nicosia helpfully point out that when you go north you are crossing into a land of murderers and rapists, and Turks over the border have painted a Turkish-Cypriot flag hundreds of metres across on a mountainside simply to irritate their Greek neighbours, one of the worstkept secrets in Cyprus is that Greek and Turkish farmers meet regularly at deserted parts of the Green Line to trade goats and other animals. As peasants, so business professionals. Kenichi Ohmae, a Japanese management writer, is withering in his contempt for borders. He argues that the natural engines of growth are not ""dysfunctional"" states but cross-border regions such as Tijuana-San Diego and Hong KongShenzhen, and urges businesses to develop an ""Anchorage mentality"", so-called because the airport there is around seven hours away from New York, Tokyo and Dusseldorf. 
Unleashed by technology and deregulation, commerce is moving the Ohmae way. Every day, $1.5 trillion moves around the world's foreign-exchange markets. Companies merge across national borders, and even talk of changing nationality completely; Swedish companies like Ericsson have reacted to high taxes by threatening to move abroad. When politicians in Paris or Jakarta thunder about Anglo-Saxons, they are referring not to gunboats but to George Soros, Rupert Murdoch and the visigoths of the Internet. 
At the same time, politicians are giving up some of their sovereignty-and some of their control over the limits of their territory-to the bureaucracies of supranational organisations. True, most formal global organisations, such as the United Nations, remain weak. But the last two decades have also seen an outbreak of trans-border networking between different branches of nation states. Countries around the world have joined with their neighhours to deal with problems like pollution and drugs. Most of this opening up has been at a regional level. Every continent bar Antarctica now has its own frontierlowering trade pact. In most cases these have led to other sorts of integration, too. Having successfully adopted a single market, the European Union is now taking on a single currency. Thanks to Mercosur, children in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, now have to learn Spanish; and there are even (whisper it quietly) a handful of Argentines who now admit to being Latin Americans. 
In another example of the conservation of finitude, the success of regional international institutions has actually encouraged separatist movements in places like Scotland, Northern Italy, Flanders and Quebec to press for more borders. Now that power is seeping away from Rome to Brussels, many Venetians would rather live in an independent city-state. In as much as international bodies and agreements lower the costs of having borders, small nations that would like to have states see them as more affordable. This affordability can cut both ways, though. If Canada is divisible, Canadian federalists argue, so is Quebec. About 50 municipalities representing about one in 12 of the province's citizens have voted that they would rather stay Canadian. 
Various intellectuals, such as the veteran Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, have seized on the erosion of borders as evidence that the nation state is merely a (usually bloody) phase of development that most developed countries are now close to the end of. This argument can be paired with the idea that, in the modern world, the nation state is peculiarly wrong-sized for government. Typically, such a state is too small a unit to have any impact on the global economy, but too big to connect with the lives of its people. 
But although states may be blurring a little at the edges, it is only those in which the relationship between the state and its nation or nations is untenable, such as the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia, where things break down. Where those relationships are relatively comfortable, nations are holding on to their states and their borders, even if the borders thin. Unsurprisingly, opinion polls show no great enthusiasm for any ofthe new trans-border superstructures; they cannot enthuse as a nation can. The best that can be said for NAFTA is that it is not as unpopular as it once was; the Europeans who identify most strongly with the European Union are those trying to join it, such as the Czechs and the Hungarians. 
Borders between states can be opened or closed by fiat. Boundaries of mind and habit are harder to take down. John Helliwell, a professor at the University of British Columbia, has made a thorough study of trade across the Canadian-American border (""How much do National Borders Matter?"", Brookings Institution Press, 1998). He found that a Canadian province in 1996 was 12 times more likely to trade merchandise and 40 times more likely to trade services with another Canadian province than with an American state of similar size and distance. Interprovincial immigration was loo times more likely, after adjusting for income difference and population sizes. 
Mr Helliwell's research showed that the Free Trade Act, which came into effect in 1989, did have an impact: the ratio for traded goods had fallen from about 20:1 to 12:1 by 1993. But the level has held steady since. Although the figures are less reliable, Mr Helliwell also estimates that ""trade densities"" within countries in the European Union are around six times greater than those between members of the EU. 
Get on to my cloud 
To the extent that the economic effect of borders is decreasing, the world is slowly returning to the capital-control-free, relatively free-trading 19th century, a time when one could talk about a global labour market with a straight face. But 19th-century borders were different in another way. People moved across them more easily. Some 60m people left Europe for the new world between 1850 and 1900. For all the freeing of trade today, such freedom of movement is unheard of in the developed countries. Here the border reigns supreme-even within trade blocks. 
The single market in goods and services that spans the internal borders of the European Union also allows people from one state to work in the others. But although its states have surrendered some frontier controls, notably through the Schengen agreement, they have looked for ways to replace them, such as increasing the number of spot-checks on lorries behind borders. All those that have joined the agreement (some, like Britain, have not) have hung on to the right to reimpose controls when needed. 
One well-placed Eurocrat reckons that the Union's coming attempts to harmonise external immigration policies could present ""the next big row after the euro""and could delay the EU'S enlargement. And as the borders ease inside the EU, SO the conservation of finitude seeks to strengthen the restrictions at its edges. In Austria, whose main cities are within commuting reach of 5m foreign workers, calls for strong borders have become a rallying point for the right. 
The Mexican-American border has certainly been made easier to cross by NAFTA as long as you are inanimate or heading south. Mexicans still have a problem. The United States has already built a not-terribly-effective ""tortilla curtain"" along more than 60 miles (100km) of the Rio Grande. Guards in ""hot"" areas such as the Tucson-Nogales crossing now go out wearing bullet-proof jackets. The Border Patrol's budget will be $4.2 billion in 1999, three times the figure for 1993, and it employs 7,ooo agents, twice as many as before. 
Far from destroying the border, NAFTA has in many ways reinforced it by creating a community that relies on it. The number of people living along the Mexican-American border has increased from 3.5m in 198o to 12m. Some 4,ooo maquiladora factories employ nearly im workers in Mexico, contributing $7 billion to the local economy (the second-biggest sector after oil). Although many of these factories are becoming relatively high-tech affairs, they exist because there is still a definable border in wages: Mexican workers cost about a quarter as much as their counterparts in America. 
The border also matters to a surprising extent within the cross-border towns themselves. Take El Paso-Juarez: 40% of retail sales in El Paso are to Mexicans, and the city certainly has a more Latin feel than Houston. But then El Paso doesn't really feel like Juarez, either. The Mexican side is much poorer (2m people: no sewage system), but the attitude is what most sets the two towns apart. El Paso is a backwater. Juarez feels like a boomtown. 
When retreating to Canada after the Little Big Horn, Sitting Bull dryly noted that ""the meat of the buffalo tastes the same on both sides of the border."" People have been holding the Canadian-American border up as a model of compatibility ever since. In 1939 Churchill hailed it as ""an example to every country and a pattern for the future of the world."" Nowadays $1 billion in goods and services flows over it every day. Buffalo, which long kept its gaze focused southwards towards the rest of the United States, is now beginning to look at north-western New York state as the southern tip of a golden horseshoe stretching around Lake Ontario to Toronto. Work will soon start on a second Peace Bridge between Buffalo and Fort Erie. Down the road at Niagara Falls, the two nationalities are, at last, co-operating on how to develop the tourist attraction. 
Yet the border has hardly vanished. In the past few years, Canada and the United States have scrapped over, amongs other things, potatoes, electricity, magazines, steel, salmon and sc Bud, a particularly potent form of pot grown by British Columbian hippies. The Canadians are furious about American border laws, made with the Mexican border in mind, which NAFA forces on to them as well. One would require America's border authorities to check all its visitors ""out"" as well as ""in"", so that rather than just being waved through, Canadians would be stopped. The Canadians have won a 3o-month reprieve against this outrage, but Congress may still go ahead with it after that 
Even though it is the Americans who are throwing up most of the obstacles along the border, the most fundamental barrier is on the Canadian side. Canadians are keen to integrate their economy with that of the United States-but they do not want to become American. Canada's health system and its cultural protectionism are popular even with its businessmen. ""Yes, I want to see more economic integration,"" says one. ""But I also happen to think we have a better society-and I never want to lose it:"" 
More precious than Rubicons 
This is unsurprising at a personal level, and perhaps not that surprising at a business level. Businesses are keener on borders than they let on. There are precious few genuinely multicultural multinationals. As writers like Michael Porter have pointed out, most of the best firms gain at least some of their competitive advantage from their nationality. Coca-Cola is the strongest brand in the world because of, not despite, its Americanness. Talentclusters like Hollywood, the City of London and the Italian fashion business are tied to their host countries, even if the people in them come from all around the world. 
Free-trade agreements may lead to policy co-ordination that crosses borders and comes to be widely accepted. But borders and the nation states they partially define are about more than just administrative or economic logic. Even when they did not have a country, most Estonians knew the name of their national bird and the tune of their national anthem. (A routine meeting with Estonia's transport minister to discuss infrastructure begins with the declaration: ""We are not Russian . . . We have never been so."") 
Fundamentally, nationalism is not particularly rational, and its costs and benefits are not often counted up. In a recent edition of Foreign Affairs, Peter Drucker pointed to the long list of people-Immanuel Kant, the liberals of Austro-Hungary and Mikhail Gorbachevwho have argued that economic interdependence would prove stronger than nationalist passions. In many cases, right was on their side. ""But whenever in the last zoo years political passions and nation-state politics have collided with economic rationality, political passions and the nation state have won."" New nationalisms may yet develop; but at the moment the nationalism bound up with states still survives. For a nation to mean something normally means it needs a state, or a share in one. And for a state to mean something it needs a border. ","Borders are arbitrary abstractions, economic impediments and surprisingly ineradicable 
TODAY, the junction of Friedrichstrasse and Zimmerstrasse is just another Berlin construction site. On one side there is a billboard for Cheez Ums; on the other a banner for an Internet company proclaims the merits of ""least-cost routing"". People and cars move by regardless. 
Yet until recently Checkpoint Charlie was a monument to ""highest-price routing""-the place where East Germans seemed willing to pay any penalty as they dug, bullied, jumped, tricked or charged their way across the border. Some 2oo died in the attempt. From a table in Cafe Adler-once the gateway to freedom, now just another Berlin bar-you cannot help but feel that the march towards a ""borderless world"" is proceeding briskly. Thanks to the Schengen agreement between the countries at the heart of the EU, you could drive your Mercedes from here to Seville without so much as being looked at by a border guard. And Europe is not alone. In North America, politicians are talking about building borderless trade corridors ""from Murmansk to Monterrey"" along which you could drive a Freightliner truck made by the same world-straddling company as your Mercedes. Even in Asia, the bamboo curtain around China is gradually letting in light. And as every student of globalisation knows, money and power now leap across what frontiers are left at the touch of a button. 
But it is almost as though international politics obeyed some strange principle of the conservation of finitude: as some borders fall, so others rise. To see this principle at work, take your cup of coffee 700km east to Georgy Kusnitsov's office overlooking the windswept bridge between Narva and Ivangorod. Seven years ago the two predominantly Russian-speaking cities were part of the same country, sharing the same transport system, schools and hospital. Now Narva is the frontier town of Estonia, a fiercely independent Baltic republic. Mr Kusnitsov is the head of Ivangorod's border guards, and would welcome some nice Berlin coffee. 
Narva is not only in a different time zone to Ivangorod, but also in a different economic one. Every day, hundreds of elderly Russian-speaking Narvans cross the bridge from Estonia to go shopping in Ivangorod's shabby market. They look tired and defeated: most were dumped in the region by Soviet planners. The windy trek, moan the old ladies, is necessitated by the small pensions the Estonians pay them. One shows a jar of honey-her only purchase-which costs only seven Estonian crowns in Ivangorod (a fifth of the price in Narva). When will this all be alleviated? ""As soon as Boris Yeltsin lies under these waves,"" spits out one crone, pointing to the torrent below. 
The Estonian border-or, as some Estonians like to call it, the future eastern border of the EU-sometimes has a quaint, Tintin-like feel. In some of the rural border towers, the cash-strapped Russians parade only crude mannequins dressed up in soldiers' uniforms. In Moscow, politicians claim that it is a thoroughfare for drugs and guns. Not so, say the local border guards, who have found only the odd ounce of marijuana. Nevertheless, the sleeper from St Petersburg to Tallinn often wastes four hours at the border as guards and dogs pour through the train, turning over suitcases. Russian troops close to Estonia recently carried out a war game in which they took over a small country; it was called ""Operation Return"". Russian miners are threatening to block the border at Narva if Estonia does not buy their oil shale. ""All a country's problems end up at the border,"" laments Mr Kusnitsov. ""We are the sharp edge."" 
The art of the state 
Every distinction in human life can be treated as a border, from that between present and past (""a foreign country"") to that between self and other (""get off of my cloud"") to that between life and death (""from whose bourn no traveller returns""). However, this article will take borders fairly literally as the edges of states-and, as such, the underpinning of international politics. ""The frontier is the basic political institution,"" argues Malcolm Anderson in his comprehensive guide to borders (""Frontiers: Territory and State Formation in The Modern World"", Polity Press, 1996). ""No rule-bound economic, social or political life could be organised without them."" 
Whereas nations and peoples can be defined through histories or culture, states are a matter of geography. Nations can exist without states (the Palestinians) or between states (the Kurds or Basques). A state can contain many nations (Austro-Hungary), a part of a nation (Ireland) or no nation (the Vatican). But however many nations are involved, without a border you can have no state at all. 
A feeling of unfairness hangs around borders almost as often as uniformed guards do; the distinction between nation and state, between history and power, is often its source. European bureaucrats casually agglomerated perhaps 10,000 different African tribes and nations into just a few dozen colonial almost-states. In the area between Germany and Russia borders have flowed back and forth like rivers over flood plains. In her entertaining book on the region (""Between East and West"", Pantheon, 1994) Anne Applebaum points out that there are people born in Poland, brought up in the Soviet Union and now living in Belarus who have never left their native villages. Ukraine gets its name from Okrainy, the Russian for borderlands. 
Take the border Mr Kusnitsov guards. Some in Narva still think of the land beyond Ivangorod as their own. In Moscow, Alexei Mitrofanov, foreign-affairs spokesman for the far-right Liberal Party, complains that the border was created by trickery, and its barring of Russia's access to the Baltic Sea is like ""taking away the gates to your own home"". His idea of Russia would include not just Narva, but Belarus, most of the Ukraine and northern Kazakhstan. Mr Mitrofanov is careful to talk about referendums, integration on a bilateral basis, and the importance of persuasion. But the Estonians and Russia's other neighbours are justifiably jumpy. Most of Russia's leaders, including the prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, have made hostile noises about their Baltic borders. 
Africa and Eastern Europe may be particularly messy; but every region of the world has its disputes. Many of the borders in Asia-including those between China and Russia, India and Pakistan, and the two Koreas-are disputed. In Latin America, Argentina nearly went to war with Chile in 1978 over its southern tip and did go to war with Britain in 1982 over the Falklands. Peru and Ecuador recently signed a peace agreement over the border that sparked a minor war in 1995. 
Every time a border shifts, you can be sure that someone will want to shift it back, and claim precedent on their side. Saddam Hussein cited obscure reasons to do with the Ottoman empire for grabbing Kuwait; some Israelis maintain that the west bank of the Jordan is theirs because the Bible says so. In the Balkans it sometimes seems that every village can be turned into a casus belli. 
In fact, though, borders shift comparatively rarely. This is in part because changing them rarely quietens old conflicts down enough to make up for the new ones it sets in motion. And in general all states disapprove of changing any state's edges. Despite all that Serbia has done to the inhabitants of Kosovo, countries as far afield as China have worried about the precedent that an independent Kosovo would set. 
So borders, like rivers, tend to stick in their places, doing damage when they wander. At the same time, like rivers, borders can be high or low, easily fordable or hard to bridge. Anybody caring to find out about Enver Hoxha's Albania needed only to know that its guards occasionally took pot shots at bathers across the border. The best introduction to modem China is the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border, where British troops and Chinese red guards once glared at each other, but where now it is hard to tell whose glitzy skyscraper belongs to which side of the line. Virtually every country in the world seems to be building a bridge, a road or a tunnel to its neighbour. Estonia, for instance, wants to build a ""Via Baltica"" linking it to Finland and Latvia. 
Jeux sans frontieres 
Some groups have always hated borders. Religions tend to be against them-the papacy once disliked nationalism just as much as some of Islam does today. So do classical economists and, in principle, communists. (In practice, though, Stalin did not erase the lines on his maps, playing with them instead like a spiteful child.) Today the border is under attack from more prosaic people: businessmen and bureaucrats. 
Economics has always eaten away at political divisions. While Greek Cypriot guards in Nicosia helpfully point out that when you go north you are crossing into a land of murderers and rapists, and Turks over the border have painted a Turkish-Cypriot flag hundreds of metres across on a mountainside simply to irritate their Greek neighbours, one of the worstkept secrets in Cyprus is that Greek and Turkish farmers meet regularly at deserted parts of the Green Line to trade goats and other animals. As peasants, so business professionals. Kenichi Ohmae, a Japanese management writer, is withering in his contempt for borders. He argues that the natural engines of growth are not ""dysfunctional"" states but cross-border regions such as Tijuana-San Diego and Hong KongShenzhen, and urges businesses to develop an ""Anchorage mentality"", so-called because the airport there is around seven hours away from New York, Tokyo and Dusseldorf. 
Unleashed by technology and deregulation, commerce is moving the Ohmae way. Every day, $1.5 trillion moves around the world's foreign-exchange markets. Companies merge across national borders, and even talk of changing nationality completely; Swedish companies like Ericsson have reacted to high taxes by threatening to move abroad. When politicians in Paris or Jakarta thunder about Anglo-Saxons, they are referring not to gunboats but to George Soros, Rupert Murdoch and the visigoths of the Internet. 
At the same time, politicians are giving up some of their sovereignty-and some of their control over the limits of their territory-to the bureaucracies of supranational organisations. True, most formal global organisations, such as the United Nations, remain weak. But the last two decades have also seen an outbreak of trans-border networking between different branches of nation states. Countries around the world have joined with their neighhours to deal with problems like pollution and drugs. Most of this opening up has been at a regional level. Every continent bar Antarctica now has its own frontierlowering trade pact. In most cases these have led to other sorts of integration, too. Having successfully adopted a single market, the European Union is now taking on a single currency. Thanks to Mercosur, children in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, now have to learn Spanish; and there are even (whisper it quietly) a handful of Argentines who now admit to being Latin Americans. 
In another example of the conservation of finitude, the success of regional international institutions has actually encouraged separatist movements in places like Scotland, Northern Italy, Flanders and Quebec to press for more borders. Now that power is seeping away from Rome to Brussels, many Venetians would rather live in an independent city-state. In as much as international bodies and agreements lower the costs of having borders, small nations that would like to have states see them as more affordable. This affordability can cut both ways, though. If Canada is divisible, Canadian federalists argue, so is Quebec. About 50 municipalities representing about one in 12 of the province's citizens have voted that they would rather stay Canadian. 
Various intellectuals, such as the veteran Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, have seized on the erosion of borders as evidence that the nation state is merely a (usually bloody) phase of development that most developed countries are now close to the end of. This argument can be paired with the idea that, in the modern world, the nation state is peculiarly wrong-sized for government. Typically, such a state is too small a unit to have any impact on the global economy, but too big to connect with the lives of its people. 
But although states may be blurring a little at the edges, it is only those in which the relationship between the state and its nation or nations is untenable, such as the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia, where things break down. Where those relationships are relatively comfortable, nations are holding on to their states and their borders, even if the borders thin. Unsurprisingly, opinion polls show no great enthusiasm for any ofthe new trans-border superstructures; they cannot enthuse as a nation can. The best that can be said for NAFTA is that it is not as unpopular as it once was; the Europeans who identify most strongly with the European Union are those trying to join it, such as the Czechs and the Hungarians. 
Borders between states can be opened or closed by fiat. Boundaries of mind and habit are harder to take down. John Helliwell, a professor at the University of British Columbia, has made a thorough study of trade across the Canadian-American border (""How much do National Borders Matter?"", Brookings Institution Press, 1998). He found that a Canadian province in 1996 was 12 times more likely to trade merchandise and 40 times more likely to trade services with another Canadian province than with an American state of similar size and distance. Interprovincial immigration was loo times more likely, after adjusting for income difference and population sizes. 
Mr Helliwell's research showed that the Free Trade Act, which came into effect in 1989, did have an impact: the ratio for traded goods had fallen from about 20:1 to 12:1 by 1993. But the level has held steady since. Although the figures are less reliable, Mr Helliwell also estimates that ""trade densities"" within countries in the European Union are around six times greater than those between members of the EU. 
Get on to my cloud 
To the extent that the economic effect of borders is decreasing, the world is slowly returning to the capital-control-free, relatively free-trading 19th century, a time when one could talk about a global labour market with a straight face. But 19th-century borders were different in another way. People moved across them more easily. Some 60m people left Europe for the new world between 1850 and 1900. For all the freeing of trade today, such freedom of movement is unheard of in the developed countries. Here the border reigns supreme-even within trade blocks. 
The single market in goods and services that spans the internal borders of the European Union also allows people from one state to work in the others. But although its states have surrendered some frontier controls, notably through the Schengen agreement, they have looked for ways to replace them, such as increasing the number of spot-checks on lorries behind borders. All those that have joined the agreement (some, like Britain, have not) have hung on to the right to reimpose controls when needed. 
One well-placed Eurocrat reckons that the Union's coming attempts to harmonise external immigration policies could present ""the next big row after the euro""and could delay the EU'S enlargement. And as the borders ease inside the EU, SO the conservation of finitude seeks to strengthen the restrictions at its edges. In Austria, whose main cities are within commuting reach of 5m foreign workers, calls for strong borders have become a rallying point for the right. 
The Mexican-American border has certainly been made easier to cross by NAFTA as long as you are inanimate or heading south. Mexicans still have a problem. The United States has already built a not-terribly-effective ""tortilla curtain"" along more than 60 miles (100km) of the Rio Grande. Guards in ""hot"" areas such as the Tucson-Nogales crossing now go out wearing bullet-proof jackets. The Border Patrol's budget will be $4.2 billion in 1999, three times the figure for 1993, and it employs 7,ooo agents, twice as many as before. 
Far from destroying the border, NAFTA has in many ways reinforced it by creating a community that relies on it. The number of people living along the Mexican-American border has increased from 3.5m in 198o to 12m. Some 4,ooo maquiladora factories employ nearly im workers in Mexico, contributing $7 billion to the local economy (the second-biggest sector after oil). Although many of these factories are becoming relatively high-tech affairs, they exist because there is still a definable border in wages: Mexican workers cost about a quarter as much as their counterparts in America. 
The border also matters to a surprising extent within the cross-border towns themselves. Take El Paso-Juarez: 40% of retail sales in El Paso are to Mexicans, and the city certainly has a more Latin feel than Houston. But then El Paso doesn't really feel like Juarez, either. The Mexican side is much poorer (2m people: no sewage system), but the attitude is what most sets the two towns apart. El Paso is a backwater. Juarez feels like a boomtown. 
When retreating to Canada after the Little Big Horn, Sitting Bull dryly noted that ""the meat of the buffalo tastes the same on both sides of the border."" People have been holding the Canadian-American border up as a model of compatibility ever since. In 1939 Churchill hailed it as ""an example to every country and a pattern for the future of the world."" Nowadays $1 billion in goods and services flows over it every day. Buffalo, which long kept its gaze focused southwards towards the rest of the United States, is now beginning to look at north-western New York state as the southern tip of a golden horseshoe stretching around Lake Ontario to Toronto. Work will soon start on a second Peace Bridge between Buffalo and Fort Erie. Down the road at Niagara Falls, the two nationalities are, at last, co-operating on how to develop the tourist attraction.

But it took nearly 300 years more before a major exhibition of Mayan treasures was put on in Europe. ""The Maya"", at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice until May i6th, brings together more than 600 pieces covering 2,ooo years of Mayan art from Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras. 
""Here are the crown jewels of the Mayan culture,"" says Paolo Vitti, director of the Palazzo Grassi. A seven-ton stone panel or stele from Mexico city's Museum of Anthropology, depicting scenes in relief from Mayan mythology, is one of the show's centrepieces. There are also elegant naturalistic life-sized limestone heads from Palenque in the Mexican highlands, stone sculpture from Copan in Honduras and jade death masks from the city of Tikal in the northern Guatemalan rainforest. The exhibition, which, Mr Vitti hopes, will draw in as many as a million visitors, will fuel European interest and no doubt also, the growing European market for Mayan artefacts. 
This is the prototype ""correct"" exhibition of antiquities. Mr Vitti hopes it will help discourage the ransacking of archaeological sites and encourage governments to work harder at keeping their culture intact. Mr Vitti says he has made certain that everything on view comes only from government museums in the region (as well as the odd public collection in North America and Europe), and not from dealers or private collectors in search of museum exposure to authenticate or enhance the value of their property. Moreover, the curators have chosen not to use the kind of jewel-box installation that stresses connoisseurship of a single object over its cultural context. On every wall, as well as in the show's 7oo-page catalogue, visitors are reminded that the objects are part of a rich Mayan cosmology of religion, politics, astronomy and mathematics. 
The decision to lend so many artworks will test a new strategy among those Central American countries that are battling to keep their heritage from being dismantled and sold to collectors around the world. In Guatemala alone, officials suspect that $iom worth of antiquities are illegally shipped out of the country every month, most of it bound for galleries that sell on to private collectors in Europe and America. Existing routes for drugs and weapons ease the passage. 
The sale or export of archaeological artefacts, except for temporary museum loans, is prohibited by all of the region's governments, so archaeologists warn that if a Mayan object which has left Central America within the past 50 years is exhibited in a gallery or private collection, it is inevitably stolen property. There is no legal market for ""new"" objects. 
Nevertheless, demand for these objects is rising. So, too, is the pillaging of archaeological sites throughout Central America. Looters rarely work with surgical precision. To penetrate the tombs containing prized painted ceramics and sculpture, looters routinely chainsaw their way through centuries of Mayan architecture. Often they are able get to these sites before the archaeologists, haphazardly destroying much that is valuable in their haste to dig objects up. ""For one beautiful pot, they are destroying the evidence for huge sections of Mayan culture,"" laments Peter Schmidt, director of the Merida Museum in the Yucatan, who is curator for the exhibition in Venice. ""Looters are not only stealing our treasures,"" adds Augusto Vela Mena, Guatemala's minister of culture, ""they are stealing our history."" Not to mention robbing the country of its future. 
Guatemala hopes that revenues from cultural tourism will overtake coffee within the next five years. Guatemala and El Salvador have persuaded the American government to ban the import of antiquities from their most threatened regions. Normally America does not enforce foreign export laws. But since the rule went into effect in , the American customs service has returned more than 500 objects to Guatemala. Meanwhile, the Guatemalan government is going one step further and charging one of America's most distinguished museums with possessing looted property. 
Earlier this year, Guatemalan officials requested the return of painted ceramics and other objects from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. These were allegedly excavated and exported in violation of Guatemalan laws, although they were donated to the museum by a wealthy trustee. Guatemalan officials offered to leave the pottery on extended loan in Boston, pending its eventual return, and to lend comparable objects for a long period once the works in Boston were sent back to Guatemala. ""It's not as if these countries are locking up the stuff so nobody can see it,"" says Richard Hansen, an archaeologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""They're willing to make long-term transfers all over the world."" The Boston museum rejected the offer, insisting it had broken no American laws by accepting the donation. Guatemala will now press its claims in court, and it's not bluffing. It has hired two veteran cultural-property lawyers, Larry Kaye and Howard Spiegler, and plans to sue other American museums. 
This pressure on American collectors is helping shift the trade in Mesoamerican objects to Europe. Mesoamerican archaeology is a chic novelty in Europe these days, partly because so many Europeans are now visiting those sites. Fashion drives the consumer market in antiquities, and travel, alas, brings with it a taste for souvenirs. Rich pickings 
Guatemala's energetic campaign against that trade also attacks the source. With its bloody civil war now over, the government is training its once-dreaded military to turn its guns on looters. This has not been entirely successful. There is so much money to be made supplying the art market with looted antiquities that some soldiers and officials have not been able to resist becoming involved. So far, government efforts, ambitious foreign loans and a last-ditch attempt at removing the stelae from buildings-like pre-emptively cutting off the rhino's horn-have had little effect on a worsening situation. And archaeologists now speak of sites in Belize and Guatemala, untouched ten years ago, as being bombcratered-so extensively tunnelled by looters that they are unsalvageable. 
Sadly, an exhibition like ""The Maya"", that shows a wide range of exquisite ol jects, will almost inevitably whet collectors' appetites. Central American governments must hope it will also promote support for the preservation and protection of cultural sites. Which will have the upper hand remains to be seen.

This pressure on American collectors is helping shift the trade in Mesoamerican objects to Europe. Mesoamerican archaeology is a chic novelty in Europe these days, partly because so many Europeans are now visiting those sites. Fashion drives the consumer market in antiquities, and travel, alas, brings with it a taste for souvenirs. Rich pickings 
Guatemala's energetic campaign against that trade also attacks the source. With its bloody civil war now over, the government is training its once-dreaded military to turn its guns on looters. This has not been entirely successful. There is so much money to be made supplying the art market with looted antiquities that some soldiers and officials have not been able to resist becoming involved. So far, government efforts, ambitious foreign loans and a last-ditch attempt at removing the stelae from buildings-like pre-emptively cutting off the rhino's horn-have had little effect on a worsening situation. And archaeologists now speak of sites in Belize and Guatemala, untouched ten years ago, as being bombcratered-so extensively tunnelled by looters that they are unsalvageable. 
Sadly, an exhibition like ""The Maya"", that shows a wide range of exquisite ol jects, will almost inevitably whet collectors' appetites. Central American governments must hope it will also promote support for the preservation and protection of cultural sites. Which will have the upper hand remains to be seen.

MILES DAVIS. By lan Carr. HarperCollins; 658 pages; L19.99 
GARY GIDDINS describes jazz's century as a ""tangled epic"". As the authoritative critic of the Village Voice, there is hardly anyone alive who is better placed to make sense of jazz's profusion. Gone are the (good) old days when jazz history presented a reassuring and rather high-minded progression from traditional to swing and on to bebop and beyond. Today all kinds of sounds, from all manner of places, claim to derive their pedigree from that original vital source. 
Mr Giddins's massive volume collects a quarter-century of reportage, and his wideranging taste and deep acquaintance, not just with jazz but with classical music and culture generally, give it a special coherence and point. He portrays a galaxy of artists, ranging from the early New Orleans masters to the very latest prodigies. He insists throughout on the changing, spontaneous nature of jazz, pointing out that it took a while before the music even had a name. 
Louis Armstrong, he reminds readers, was ""the product of 30 years of musical customs unique to New Orleans that weren't tagged as jazz until they were successfully expurgated, tricked-up for laughs and brought north by the white Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1916."" 
This strong sense of history and context makes Mr Giddins much more than your average jazz journo, and his writing abounds with stimulating observations, even if his far-flung gift for reference occasionally gets the better of him. In addition to being a master of the provocative statement, Mr Giddins is a dab hand at the deft biographical sketch. His subjects are not just placed in their historical settings, but examined in terms of their characters and achievements. Most of the giants are here, but so are less well-known figures, in keeping with Mr Giddins's belief that, although ""everyone venerates and assimilates the masters"", the odd personalities that ""bloom in their shadows . . . should be valued no less."" 
Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it is clearly the work of a man who is still a passionate fan of the music, whatever bewildering and problematic form it may take. His fascination and ardour show through on every page, and the reader will find that these ""Visions of Jazz"" continue to illuminate his or her own long after they have closed the book. 
No less passionate are Danny Barker and Ian Carr. Barker, who died in 1994, was a native of New Orleans; the city where, around 19oo or so, a wild, free music rose out of gaudy vice and easy virtue. For yearn- ing fans like Philip Larkin, an English poet who felt himself to be stifled by helpless respectability, New Orleans symbolised ""an enormous yes"". Barker was one of the first African-Americans to record recollections of the city's musical and social heritage. Much of it involved his own family; his relations had first-hand knowledge of legendary figures like Buddy Bolden, the cornettist reckoned to be the key figure in the emergence of jazz. 
In the teeming music scene, Bolden embodied everything gorgeous that New Orleans and jazz stood for-the kingly object of male admiration and multiple female desire, who ""called his children home"" by the hundreds with a single bluesy blast of his horn. But the strain of domination took its toll. Under the demands of the sporting life, the unceasing rounds of girlfriends, liquor and funky blues-he snapped, and was committed to a mental hospital in yo7, dying there in 1931. 
Mr Carr's biography of Miles Davis reveals that a similar fate almost befell that later jazz trumpeter. When the first edition was published in 1982, Davis was just emerging from a shadowy five-year silence. Since Davis's death in 1991, Mr Carr has been able to probe that period further and complete his account of this gifted, if difficult, man. Like Bolden, Davis was not just a musician but an icon, known as much for his elegant clothes, fast cars and glittering women as for the spare, dark sound of his trumpet. Both jazz fans and trend spotters were attracted by his wilful unpredictability. He was moody and taciturn; on stage he sometimes turned his back on the audience, rejecting the glad-handing showmanship of earlier days. Musically, his career blazed a long and brilliant trail from bebop with Charlie Parker to epoch-making cool jazz, orchestral suites with arranger Gil Evans and landmark quintets which launched such young stars as John Coltrane and Herbie Hancock. Finally, in the late 196os, he made the most controversial leap of all, into the heavy, spaced-out electronics of rock. 
Many critics were appalled at this volteface; one even wept at a new-style Davis concert. But Mr Carr has passionately defended every stage of the trumpeter's progress, believing that his over-riding responsibility was to his hearers and to the new cultural awareness he was trying to work into his music. Certainly Davis seemed to be aiming at a new mass audience, wanting his records to ""get back to the black people, so I will be remembered when I die."" But hard-line jazz lovers-many of them also black-accused him of merely selling out to pop values, manifest in the ever more outre dress and manner which went with his public image as ""the prince of darkness"". 
A combination of controversy, spiritual exhaustion and illness drove Davis into his five-year retreat. Mr Carr's description is more than uncomfortable; the seedy torpor of drugs, women and endless hours before a giant television recall Elvis Presley. But unlike the Graceland recluse, Davis was rescued from his downward spiral by the determined efforts of friends and family, and he returned to playing-and to further controversial alliances with pop stars such as Prince-before his final decline and death. 
Mr Carr sees his subject as a heroic, Promethean figure, but Davis can also seem arrogant and abusive, particularly where women were concerned. As for his art, future critics will decide whether his later choices were valid. But there is no question that his story, like those of so many whom Barker and Giddins also describe, illustrates that the jazz life is not for tourists. ","VISIONS OF JAzz: THE FIRST CENTURY.

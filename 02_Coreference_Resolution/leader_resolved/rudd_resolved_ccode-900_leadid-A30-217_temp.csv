GUANTANAMO BAY is a long way from the Sydney suburbs that will form a decisive battleground in Australia's general election expected later this year. Yet the case of David Hicks, a 31-year-old Australian detainee at Guantanamo, has worked its way into the minds of voters who will decide whether the conservative coalition government, led by John Howard, wins a fifth term. Mr Hicks has been held at Guantanamo Bay for five years, most of that time without charge (see page 56). On March 26th, after a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to a charge of providing material support for terrorism. 
Depending on the length of a prison sentence due to be decided a few days later, he might return to Australia a free man or to serve time in an Australian jail. Mr Howard and his colleagues breathed a collective sigh of relief at what Alexander Downer, the foreign minister, called a ""saga that has come to a conclusion"". The potential political fallout from the Hicks case, though, makes this judgment somewhat premature.
After Mr Hicks was arrested with Taliban fighters in Afghanistan in late 2001 and sent to Guantanamo Bay, Mr Howard's government washed its hands of him. One minister described him then as ""one of the world's most dangerous people"". This is at odds with reports of Mr Hicks's interviews with Australian police, when he was quoted as condemning the September 11th 2001 attacks on America. ""It's not Islam is it?"" he is supposed to have said. ""It's like the opposite of what I wanted to do.""
Regardless of his alleged crimes, the longer he was locked up in Guantanamo Bay, the more Mr Hicks became a focus among many Australians over two issues: legal rights and the Howard government's perceived subservience to the Bush administration. Mr Howard has sent Australian soldiers to fight in both Iraq and Afghanistan. George Bush hardly helped his image in 2003 when, asked whether Australia was a ""deputy sheriff"", he responded by promoting it to ""sheriff"".
After 11 years in power, Mr Howard is facing the worst opinion polls of his prime ministership. A poll on March 20th gave Labor a 22-point lead over the government. Other issues played a part: the government's new workplace laws, its tardy response on climate change and a popular new Labor leader, Kevin Rudd. 
However, a poll in December on the Hicks case itself rocked the government. It showed that about two-thirds of Australians thought Mr Hicks should be returned to Australia, and only one-quarter supported Mr Howard's hands-off approach. Since then Mr Howard has changed his public tune, blaming America for the delays in bringing Mr Hicks to trial. That may not be enough to assuage public anger, which probably runs deep enough to affect elections in a few months' time.

WHEN Kevin Rudd was a student, 30 years ago, he contacted Gough Whitlam, a former Labor Party prime minister, asking for tips on making a career in politics. Mr Whitlam advised him to do three things: join one of Australia's two main political parties, get a university degree and master a foreign language. Mr Rudd did all three (he is a fluent Mandarin speaker). Now, a few months away from a general election, opinion polls have him in a commanding position to become prime minister himself.
Since Mr Rudd took over the opposition Labor leadership in December, the party's bid to break the 11-year rule of John Howard's conservative coalition has looked ever more achievable. A poll on May 1st showed Labor ahead by 14 percentage points after preference votes were distributed. Labor's stock had already started rising before he took over but the difference Mr Rudd has made, after a succession of lacklustre predecessors, is to challenge Mr Howard's dominance as the country's most popular leader. The same poll gave Mr Rudd a seven-point lead as preferred prime minister.
On April 27th Mr Rudd used Labor's policymaking conference in Sydney to stamp his authority on the party. He portrayed himself, at 49, as the face of the future, with fresh policies on education, climate change and nationwide broadband access, against Mr Howard, at 67, as someone who doesn't believe in any idea that ""didn't appear on black-and-white television"". So far, voters like what they see.
A former diplomat and China consultant, Mr Rudd comes from outside the old Labor mould. His party, though, is still beholden to the trade unions that formed its original power base almost a century ago. Its problem is that Australia as a whole no longer reflects this. About one-fifth of all workers now belong to unions, even fewer in the private sector.
So Mr Rudd is trying to distance himself from the party's old image. Business leaders flocked as observers to the Sydney conference to hear him ring their bells. He pledged to ""back the business community wherever we can"" and called small businesses the ""backbone of the Australian economy"". Yet business leaders are fuming over his plan to ditch Mr Howard's workplace reforms, removing the freedom of workers and bosses to agree on individual contracts and returning to centralised wage-bargaining. Mr Rudd's attempt to pose as business's new best friend while appeasing the union barons by reviving inflexible and outdated labour policies may prove a difficult trick to sustain as the election campaign heats up.
Elsewhere, Mr Rudd is on firmer ground. He has started hand-picking candidates for key constituencies, bypassing Labor's tortuous selection process, which invariably rewarded apparatchiks. Maxine McKew, a popular former television journalist, will challenge Mr Howard in his constituency in Sydney, which a recent boundary change has rendered less safe for the prime minister. Mr Rudd has also started doing things that make him look prime ministerial. In March he called business and science leaders to Canberra for a conference on climate change. On April 20th he addressed the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, on how Australia and America should conduct their relations with China. In June he will lead a delegation of business bosses, scientists and politicians to China to discuss global warming.
Things have gone Mr Rudd's way so far, but the final months before the election (expected in October or November) will be tougher. On May 8th Mr Howard's government will present its last budget before the election. Buoyed by the lowest unemployment in 30 years, low inflation and a big surplus, the government is well placed to offer tax cuts and other goodies. Mr Howard has seen off four previous Labor leaders and won the past four elections. He is not ready to give up yet.

""AT THIS time, there is a greater than usual risk of the development of policy proposals that are, frankly, bad."" That was Ken Henry, head of Australia's Treasury (finance department), and one of the country's most respected civil servants, speaking confidentially to colleagues in Canberra recently. Mr Henry was giving warning of the dangers that arise when a government faces an election in a booming economy like Australia's.
The country has had 16 years of continuous growth, the past 11 of them under John Howard's conservative coalition. In that period, the economy has regularly grown faster than other industrialised countries (see chart). Thanks to reforms inherited from its Labor predecessor, its own prudent fiscal management and a revenue boom from China's demand for Australia's minerals, the government is blessed with an enormous fiscal surplus, low inflation, unemployment at a 33-year low and a reputation for competent economic management.
With an election due later this year (in October or November), Mr Howard ought to be coasting to victory. Instead, his party has been trailing the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls by an average of 16 points --enough to lose in a landslide. This week's budget, the 12th delivered by Peter Costello, the treasurer, set out to restore Mr Howard's electoral fortunes as he seeks an unprecedented fifth term.
The government has fallen foul, for now, of a resurgent Labor Party on two key points. Voters like Kevin Rudd, who took over as opposition leader six months ago. And Labor has capitalised on the unpopularity of Mr Howard's workplace-law reforms that replace collective bargaining with a system of individual contracts.
Mr Howard has taken two steps to try to neutralise Mr Rudd's appeal. The first came on May 4th, when he watered down his workplace laws, something he once vowed he would never do. The changes give lower-paid workers, the so-called ""battlers"" on whom Mr Howard has built his success, guarantees of compensation if the new contracts deprive them of overtime pay and other conditions. Business leaders are dismayed.
The second step is the budget announced on May 8th. The Labor leader has struck a chord with voters over promises to boost education and tackle climate change. In response, the budget offered A$5 billion ($4 billion) for new research centres in Australia's public universities, cash to improve literacy and numeracy in schools and incentives for all Australians to put solar panels on their roofs. University vice-chancellors, whose budgets have been squeezed since the government took office in 1996, cheered their windfall.
At the last three of Mr Howard's four election victories, budgets helped restore his fortunes when his government was behind in the polls (though he was never as far behind as he is now). By offering voters about A$30 billion in tax cuts, the fifth cut in a row, A$40 billion in spending on things like for child care, elderly people, and transport, and by keeping an A$10 billion surplus, a possible war chest for more spending closer to the election, Mr Costello is hoping to do the trick again.
But Mr Howard remains vulnerable. The budget's spending could prove to be inflationary rather than productive. This is what Mr Henry had in mind when he worried about bad policy proposals.
The danger is real. Voters have been hit with four interest-rate rises since Mr Howard campaigned at the last election in 2004 on a promise to keep rates low. Chris Richardson, director of Access Economics, a consultancy, fears the tax cuts might prove inflationary, which could prompt the central bank to raise rates. Given the enormous rise in household debt, Australians would not easily swallow that.
So Australia's boom could prove a ""winner's curse"", unless its politicians resolve the conflict between handing out sweeteners and investing for the future. ""We're doing so well that we're struggling to deal with it,"" says Mr Richardson. Other countries should be so lucky.","Australia illustrates the perils of economic success

IT IS standing room only at an election rally in Bennelong, the Sydney constituency held by John Howard, Australia's prime minister. The audience of about 500 mainly middle-aged, middle-class people in the city's conservative heartland has come to hear Mike Kelly, a former army colonel in Iraq. Mr Kelly is standing in the election due this year as a candidate for the main opposition Labor Party; Labor promises to withdraw the 500 Australian combat troops Mr Howard's government has sent to Iraq. He earns loud applause when he describes the American-led invasion as ""very flawed"" and ""lacking legitimacy"". Maxine McKew, a former television journalist who is Labor's candidate against Mr Howard in Bennelong, wins more by declaring: ""I am not running as a diversionary tactic. I am running to win.""
A year ago few would have taken such a claim seriously. But as Mr Howard prepares to seek a fifth term for his conservative coalition government, voters in suburban Sydney, who have underpinned his government since it took power 11 years ago, appear to be deserting him. An opinion poll on September 4th sent shudders through government ranks. After distribution of second votes under Australia's preferential system, it put Labor 18 points ahead of the government and Kevin Rudd, Labor's leader, 11 points ahead of Mr Howard as preferred prime minister. With these figures, Mr Howard would not just lose office; analysts say he would also lose Bennelong, whose once safe boundaries have shifted since the last election.
To compound Mr Howard's anxiety, the poll appeared on the day George Bush arrived in Sydney for a summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (APEC). This gathering of 21 regional leaders to discuss climate change, trade liberalisation and closer business ties (without obligation to reach binding commitments on any of them) is the most powerful international assembly ever to convene in the country. Mr Howard had hoped that playing world statesman, with Australia's biggest, most dazzling city as backdrop, would boost his re-election chances.
Since APEC's planning, though, the political mood has shifted, especially against Mr Howard's staunch support for Mr Bush. An opinion poll on August 30th by the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think-tank, found 69% of Australians had an unfavourable view of America because of Mr Bush, and 63% because of America's foreign policies. Still, Mr Howard assured Mr Bush in Sydney that Australia would withdraw no troops from Iraq. He and Mr Bush announced stronger military ties, upgrading Australia's access to American equipment and intelligence.
Even though most Australians support their country's alliance with America, playing ""deputy sheriff "" to Mr Bush at home will not endear Mr Howard to voters. Mr Bush arrived to the tightest security measures Sydney has seen. A 5km (3-mile) concrete-and-steel fence through the business district, with about 5,000 police and troops patrolling the streets, turned the normally relaxed city into something resembling a war zone. Small-business owners, whose operations inside the security zone were killed for the duration, grumbled bitterly.
These are Mr Howard's natural constituents. Many come from suburbs such as Campbelltown, west of Bennelong, where voters are troubled less by Iraq and more by making ends meet. Aaron Rule, Campbelltown's mayor, says ""mortgage stress"" is a big issue there. Five interest-rate rises since the last election in 2004, at which Mr Howard promised to keep rates low, have hurt borrowers. Campbelltown belongs to a federal constituency the government has held for 11 years; Mr Rule believes it could swing back to Labor next time.
After the APEC leaders leave, Mr Howard's first task will be to name an election date. Even if his poll ratings revive somewhat, an October election would be a risk. But hanging on until November could be even worse. After figures this week showing the Australian economy growing at 4.3% a year, the central bank may be tempted to raise rates yet again in early November to deter inflation. Another rate rise would probably seal Mr Howard's fate. Either way, he has a grim choice.

A FESTIVAL to celebrate the Granny Smith apple, born in his Sydney constituency of Bennelong, is an event John Howard, Australia's prime minister, might normally feel he could safely skip. Not this year. Mr Howard has called a general election for November 24th. After 11 years in power, dominating Australia's political scene like few before him, Mr Howard is facing the fight of his life. Opinion polls suggest his conservative coalition government could be heading for a defeat by the Labor Party. With redrawn boundaries, and a popular local Labor opponent--Maxine McKew, a former television journalist--even Bennelong could fall. This bleak spectre keeps Mr Howard grounded on his home turf more than ever.
On October 15th a poll gave Labor a 12-point lead after the distribution of second votes under Australia's preferential system. After a similar result in May, Mr Howard warned his Liberal Party that the government risked ""annihilation"" unless things changed. Such a poll deficit would easily give Labor the extra 16 seats it needs in the 150-seat House of Representatives to form a government.
The campaign was barely a day old before Mr Howard fired his first big shot. He promised tax cuts worth A$34 billion ($30.6 billion) over the next three years. They came on the back of figures showing the government rolling in money as Australia enters its 17th year of uninterrupted growth. Since the budget in May, the Treasury in Canberra has revised its 2007-08 growth forecast from 3.75% to 4.25%, and raised its forecast cash surplus by A$4.2 billion to A$14.8 billion. The tax cuts signalled Mr Howard's plan to fight the election on economic management, one of only two issues (with national security) on which he rates higher than Labor.
Steering the economy through a boom fuelled largely by China's demand for Australia's minerals has served Mr Howard well up to now. Written off by one pundit as ""the most unlikely prime minister in modern Australian politics"" when he was opposition leader 20 years ago, Mr Howard has since won four successive elections, and is the second-longest serving prime minister in the country's history. Voters in their 20s and early 30s have nothing to compare with the Howard government's 11 years of high employment, low inflation and few, if any, challenges to the social order: the ""comfortable and relaxed"" country Mr Howard said he wanted when he became prime minister. So some pundits are as bewildered as Mr Howard himself by his unpopularity.
His critics have no shortage of explanations. Mr Howard's tendency to use budget surpluses to throw money at voters in marginal seats shows a reckless side that has probably hurt as many voters as it has helped. In a bid to dampen a push on inflation from too much boom-time spending, the Reserve Bank has raised interest rates five times since the last election in 2004. Mr Howard won that election on a campaign promise to keep rates low, suggesting a power over the independent central bank he does not have. He can now only hope the bank does not raise rates yet again when it meets on November 6th.
The government's 2005 workplace laws, giving employers stronger power over workers, are also likely to cost it votes. Mr Howard's strong support for the war in Iraq is deeply unpopular. His conservative social policies have shifted the Liberal Party to the right and alienated many in the party's centre. Having ignored the smouldering issue of reconciliation with Australia's indigenous people, Mr Howard surprised everyone when he declared on October 11th that he would hold a referendum to recognise aborigines in Australia's constitution if he is re-elected.

Then, at 68, Mr Howard is looking and sounding his age against Labor's leader, Kevin Rudd, 50, who can be his match as a political tactician. Win or lose, this looks likely to be Mr Howard's last election. After the Liberal Party panicked in September over the bad opinion polls, Mr Howard reluctantly pledged to retire ""well into"" a fifth term. He has brought Peter Costello, the Treasurer (finance minister), out of the shadows to campaign with him. Mr Howard has a strong sense of his own legacy. Handing over to this younger heir-apparent would hurt. But the alternative ending is too awful for him to contemplate.","So why is John Howard so behind in the opinion polls?
A FESTIVAL to celebrate the Granny Smith apple, born in his Sydney constituency of Bennelong, is an event John Howard, Australia's prime minister, might normally feel he could safely skip. Not this year. Mr Howard has called a general election for November 24th. After 11 years in power, dominating Australia's political scene like few before him, Mr Howard is facing the fight of his life. Opinion polls suggest his conservative coalition government could be heading for a defeat by the Labor Party. With redrawn boundaries, and a popular local Labor opponent--Maxine McKew, a former television journalist--even Bennelong could fall. This bleak spectre keeps Mr Howard grounded on his home turf more than ever.
On October 15th a poll gave Labor a 12-point lead after the distribution of second votes under Australia's preferential system. After a similar result in May, Mr Howard warned his Liberal Party that the government risked ""annihilation"" unless things changed. Such a poll deficit would easily give Labor the extra 16 seats it needs in the 150-seat House of Representatives to form a government.
The campaign was barely a day old before Mr Howard fired his first big shot. He promised tax cuts worth A$34 billion ($30.6 billion) over the next three years. They came on the back of figures showing the government rolling in money as Australia enters its 17th year of uninterrupted growth. Since the budget in May, the Treasury in Canberra has revised its 2007-08 growth forecast from 3.75% to 4.25%, and raised its forecast cash surplus by A$4.2 billion to A$14.8 billion. The tax cuts signalled Mr Howard's plan to fight the election on economic management, one of only two issues (with national security) on which he rates higher than Labor.
Steering the economy through a boom fuelled largely by China's demand for Australia's minerals has served Mr Howard well up to now. Written off by one pundit as ""the most unlikely prime minister in modern Australian politics"" when he was opposition leader 20 years ago, Mr Howard has since won four successive elections, and is the second-longest serving prime minister in the country's history. Voters in their 20s and early 30s have nothing to compare with the Howard government's 11 years of high employment, low inflation and few, if any, challenges to the social order: the ""comfortable and relaxed"" country Mr Howard said he wanted when he became prime minister. So some pundits are as bewildered as Mr Howard himself by his unpopularity.
His critics have no shortage of explanations. Mr Howard's tendency to use budget surpluses to throw money at voters in marginal seats shows a reckless side that has probably hurt as many voters as it has helped. In a bid to dampen a push on inflation from too much boom-time spending, the Reserve Bank has raised interest rates five times since the last election in 2004. Mr Howard won that election on a campaign promise to keep rates low, suggesting a power over the independent central bank he does not have. He can now only hope the bank does not raise rates yet again when it meets on November 6th.
The government's 2005 workplace laws, giving employers stronger power over workers, are also likely to cost it votes. Mr Howard's strong support for the war in Iraq is deeply unpopular. His conservative social policies have shifted the Liberal Party to the right and alienated many in the party's centre. Having ignored the smouldering issue of reconciliation with Australia's indigenous people, Mr Howard surprised everyone when he declared on October 11th that he would hold a referendum to recognise aborigines in Australia's constitution if he is re-elected.

IN THE campaign for Australia's federal election on November 24th, Kevin Rudd, leader of the main opposition Labor Party, has so far flummoxed the conservative coalition government, under John Howard, at every turn. When a Sydney newspaper published a story in August that Mr Rudd had visited a New York strip club in 2003, during an official visit to the United Nations, Mr Rudd accused the government of planting it. The story, and Mr Rudd's confession that his memory of the evening had been clouded by drink, probably helped him: in the next opinion poll, Labor's standing went up four points. It has continued to soar since.
Mr Rudd began this week, the campaign's third, on the Great Barrier Reef. He promised A$200m ($184m) to help save it from more environmental damage. Then he moved onshore to promise a target for Australia to generate one-fifth of its electricity from wind, solar, geothermal ""hot rocks"" and other renewable sources by 2020. Mr Howard, seeking a fifth term as prime minister, accused Mr Rudd of endangering Australia's coal industry, one of its biggest exporters. But opinion polls still suggest Mr Howard's 11 years in power may be about to come to an end.
On October 30th Newspoll, a polling body, gave Labor an eight-point lead after distribution of second votes under Australia's preferential system. A demoralised government took heart from this, since it cut by half Labor's 16-point lead of a week earlier. But the new poll aligned Labor's lead with the results from two other polling organisations recently. Labor has comfortably beaten the government in all polls since January. It needs a swing of 4.8%, and a gain of 16 seats, to form a government in the 125-seat House of Representatives.
Against a seasoned campaigner such as Mr Howard, this is still a tough job. But Mr Rudd's advent as Labor leader last December seems to have put the party within striking distance of pulling it off. Since Mr Howard defeated Labor in 1996, the party has wobbled its way through three other leaders (one of whom served twice). Mr Rudd has broken all their moulds. He grew up in the 1960s on a farm in southern Queensland. After his father's accidental death, he and his mother had to leave the farm and sleep on one occasion in a car. These grim events, he says, propelled him towards a later life in politics. He shone as a student, took a degree in Chinese and became a diplomat in Beijing. He returned to Queensland where he ran the cabinet office in a state Labor government.
Although Mr Rudd entered the federal parliament only in 1998, he set out to create an impression that he had been around forever. While shadow foreign-affairs spokesman, he popped up at art gallery openings in Sydney, bookshop debates and almost any venue guaranteed to draw a crowd. His big coup was to snare a weekly spot on a breakfast television programme, where he chatted and laughed with Joe Hockey, an amiable government minister. This gave Mr Rudd a human face in Australia's suburban heartland, a territory Mr Howard once claimed as his own.
Commentators almost unanimously awarded Mr Rudd victory in the campaign's only head-to-head television debate with Mr Howard on October 21st. At 50, he looked both youthful and polished against an occasionally rattled prime minister who is 18 years his senior. Mr Rudd's campaign strategy has been to avoid fighting Mr Howard on economic management, the government's biggest strength. He says he, too, is a ""fiscal conservative"" and promises to deliver budget surpluses. Instead, he has focused on areas where he says a Labor government would change things. It would abolish the government's workplace laws, which remove the last vestiges of union power, and pour more money into education. It would also ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. More than any other issue, Labor has used Mr Howard's refusal to ratify Kyoto to feed its image of him as a leader wedded to bygone attitudes.
Mr Rudd also pledges to withdraw Australia's 500 ground troops from Iraq and to give more attention to Australia's Pacific island neighbours, where he says poverty opens a breeding-ground for terrorism and HIV. At a summit of Asian and Pacific leaders in Sydney last month, Mr Rudd upstaged Mr Howard by conversing publicly in fluent Mandarin with Hu Jintao, China's leader. All this has gone down well with voters. Since February, Mr Rudd's approval rating has not fallen below 60%; Mr Howard's has not risen above 47%.
Mr Howard is now painting Mr Rudd as a prisoner of the trade unions, Labor's traditional power base, in an era when only one-fifth of Australian workers belong to unions, and even fewer in the private sector. It may still work. Yet if Mr Rudd can maintain his campaign's tight discipline, Labor may at last have found a leader to take it back to power.","Halfway through the election campaign , Labor is still favourite to win

A STRANGE atmosphere has enveloped John Howard's campaign to win an extraordinary fifth term for his conservative coalition government. Two months ago, after a crisis of confidence over lousy opinion polls, the prime minister said he would not serve a full term if re-elected. Yet on November 12th, officially launching his re-election bid in Brisbane, he spoke as if he were planning to stay on indefinitely, declaring repeatedly to the party faithful, ""I want to tell you why I want to be prime minister of this country again.""
Two days later Kevin Rudd, leader of the opposition Labor Party, made hay of the prime minister's apparent change of heart when he launched his own campaign in the same city. He accused Mr Howard of having no plans for the future ""because he's not going to be there"". And if opinion polls a week before the November 24th election are accurate, he is right: Mr Rudd has a commanding lead (see chart).
Although Mr Howard called the election a month ago, both leaders delayed their set-piece launches to give themselves a shot in the arm in the final fortnight. Both travelled from Australia's populous southern cities to Brisbane because the ""sunshine state"" of Queensland is where the election could be won or lost. Labor holds just six of Queensland's 29 seats in the federal parliament, and hopes to pick up there several of the 16 extra seats it needs for a majority in the 150-seat House of Representatives. Mr Rudd, himself a Queenslander, could prove one of his party's most formidable weapons.
Mr Howard landed in Brisbane in the fight of his political life. He is Australia's longest-serving prime minister after Sir Robert Menzies, his political hero who founded the conservative Liberal Party which Mr Howard leads. After more than 11 years in power, he has presided over Australia's longest boom in memory, and an economy entering its 17th year of uninterrupted growth. Queensland and other resource-rich states are enjoying a mining bonanza, thanks largely to demand from China. Yet despite this, voters seem to think Mr Howard has outstayed his welcome, and could have handed over prudently last year to Peter Costello, his younger heir-apparent.
An opinion poll on November 12th gave Labor a 10-point lead, after the distribution of second preference votes from small parties. This is the average poll advantage that the opposition party has maintained since January. Mr Howard warned Liberal parliamentarians a few months ago that such numbers meant ""annihilation"" for his government.
Five days before his launch, Australia's central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points, the sixth increase since Mr Howard campaigned successfully at the last election in 2004 on a pledge to keep interest rates low. The bank followed this up with a warning that inflation was likely to exceed 3% next year, suggesting more rises are on the way. Government spending, the bank added pointedly, was contributing to inflationary pressures.
Ignoring the warnings, Mr Howard promised more than A$9 billion ($8 billion) more spending at his launch, on top of pledges costing A$43 billion since the campaign started. The most remarkable one was a tax rebate of up to A$800 for parents, regardless of income, to set against the cost of sending children to private schools, including fees, uniforms and excursions. If this was meant to trump Mr Rudd on an issue (education) he has made his own, it may not have worked. Economists and some school principals criticised the plan as welfare for the middle class; the money would be better spent, they argued, on fixing things in the schools themselves.
A youthful 50-year-old, Mr Rudd preceded his launch with a visit to cheering students at his old state school in Nambour, north of Brisbane. His launch had the zing of a leader who senses that power is within his grasp. He portrayed himself as ""a kid from country Queensland"", whom education had equipped to be a diplomat and potential prime minister. He promised more spending on schools, universities, renewable energy and a national broadband network, which, he claimed, would cost less than a quarter of Mr Howard's splurge. With impressive chutzpah, he painted Mr Howard--leader of a party that stands for small government and free markets--as the irresponsible one.
Having entered parliament only in 1998, and taken over as leader of a dispirited party only last December, Mr Rudd has made extraordinary strides in reviving Labor's fortunes. His message seems to resonate with suburban Australians, though many remain troubled by the almost complete lack of substantive differences between the main parties. Moreover, despite the nightmare polls, Mr Howard retains a lead over Mr Rudd on the question of economic management.
Mainly because of that, a last-minute victory by Mr Howard cannot be ruled out. Yet, hard though the task will be to take 16 seats from the government, the election remains Mr Rudd's to lose.","One of the most successful conservative premierships of recent years may be coming to an end

Iraq's displacement and migration minister said that 1,600 people were returning to Iraq every day because of the improving security in the capital, though some 2m Iraqis who have fled the violence remain abroad, mainly in Syria and Jordan.
Candidates loyal to Jordan's King Abdullah appeared to have done well in a general election, whereas the Islamists, who are close to the Muslim Brotherhood and have been the main legal opposition, did much worse than before. In any event, the king still calls the shots.
South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, said that anyone convicted of political offences before June 1999 could apply for a pardon. The post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission had covered those cases up to 1994.
The World Health Organisation said that the number of people with HIV is 33m, fewer than it had previously reckoned. Better data collection in India and five African countries explains the apparent fall. Some 2.1m people died of AIDS last year, down from a peak of 2.2m in 2005.
A way out for Castro?
Raul Castro, Cuba's acting leader, announced that national and municipal elections will take place on January 20th. The newly-elected National Assembly will then elect a new ruling Council of State. This could turn into a test of whether the ailing Fidel Castro can continue in his titular role as president.
Canada ordered an inquiry into the use of Tasers after a video was broadcast showing an unarmed Polish man howling in agony after being zapped with a stun gun by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Vancouver airport. The man, who had flown to Canada to live with his aged mother, died soon after.

AS ANY sports fan knows, Australia loves a winner. So to the outsider it is a shock that its voters on November 24th so decisively turfed out the government led for more than 11 years by John Howard (see page 70). Much the most successful prime minister of modern times, he had led Australia into what will be its 17th consecutive year of economic growth--probably of more than 4% this year. Moreover, the Labor opposition to him seemed, not that long ago, a shambles--divided, old-fashioned and led by losers. The leader it elected a year ago, Kevin Rudd, a rather geeky former diplomat, looked an unlikely challenger to the wily, combative and ruthless Mr Howard.
In electoral terms, Mr Rudd has now shown himself a winner. To prove so in government, he needs to learn from Mr Howard's success, as well as Labor's recent failures. The early signs suggest he has grasped the most important lessons.
The first is to demonstrate independence from the party's factions and the trade unions. The most damaging charge laid against Labor by the government's campaign was that 70% of its cabinet would be trade-union officials. By declaring that he, rather than Labor members of parliament, will appoint his cabinet, Mr Rudd jettisoned a century-old tradition, and made clear that the top man and not murky powerbrokers will call the shots. Similarly, on economic policy, Mr Rudd has been at pains to present himself as the heir to the liberalisation launched by the Labor government of the 1980s and pursued by Mr Howard, rather than as an old-fashioned tax-and-spend trade unionist. He has called himself a ""fiscal conservative"", and claimed his spending promises--lavishing resources on education, renewable energy and a national broadband network--would cost less than Mr Howard's commitments. He managed to portray Mr Howard, whose party stands for small government and free markets, as a spendthrift, and a too-ideological one at that, offering a hefty tax rebate to anyone--however well-off--who educates their children privately.
The big exception to Mr Rudd's pledge of economic continuity is a promised reform that won Labor many votes: the revision of Mr Howard's unpopular ""WorkChoices"" industrial-relations legislation. This shredded the last vestiges of trade-union power in the workplace, shifting workers on to individual employment contracts. But even here, Mr Rudd has been careful not to bind himself too tightly to the old orthodoxies. Reform will be slow, and many of the measures introduced by the government to limit union power will be retained. Voters were probably right not to buy Mr Howard's claim that the changes will cost 200,000-400,000 jobs.
The third lesson involves the relationship with America. The election confirms the Bush effect. Mr Howard's role as George Bush's ""deputy sheriff"" may have seemed a comfort a few years ago. In this campaign, however, it was a liability. Australians wanted to see clear blue water between their country and the American flagship. Mr Rudd's commitment to withdraw Australian combat troops (though not other army personnel) from Iraq starting next year was popular.
However, it would be worrying were Mr Rudd to distance himself too far from America--especially if it was part of a reluctance to offend China. The latter is now Australia's biggest trading partner, and, through its inexhaustible demand for commodities, the engine of Australia's prolonged boom. Balancing that relationship with the American alliance is the central task of Australian foreign policy.
Mr Rudd, who worked in China and speaks Mandarin, opposed a security pact that Australia signed with Japan in March. But he has also expressed support for the American- and NATO-led operations in Afghanistan. On winning the election, he was quick to stress the ""centrality"" of America to his foreign policy. Mr Bush was one of the first leaders to call him. This is an alliance not in trouble, but in electoral nuance: Gordon Brown will understand.
The changing political climate
Mr Rudd has also learned what many national leaders elsewhere will discover in the next few years: that climate change is now an election issue. A few years ago Mr Howard could get away with his robust refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol, to hobnob with Al Gore or do anything that might damage Australia's booming coal industry. No longer. This may have been one of the first national elections in which global warming was a political issue for big parties. It will not be the last.
Mr Howard was perhaps in office too long to sense that. Unlike Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher in Britain, he was not dumped by his party after a successful decade. It was left to the electorate. The climate-change debate points to a broader electoral truth: nations like to feel proud of themselves. Winning, in fact, is not enough, even in Australia: you have to do it right. That was the mood that Mr Rudd adroitly captured. When the Liberals were caught distributing fake propaganda depicting Labor as soft on Islamist terrorism, it confirmed an image of the party as abrasive: so sharp it would cut itself. Mr Rudd, by contrast, came across as Mr Howard with the rough edges sanded off. If so, Australia could do much worse.","Kevin Rudd owes John Howard a lot ; Kevin Rudd may also prove to be a success

THE votes started as a trickle, but soon became a flood. Just a few hours after polling stations closed on November 24th, Kevin Rudd stood before cheering supporters in Brisbane as Australia's new prime minister. It was a remarkable achievement for a man who entered Parliament only in 1998, and who took over the leadership of a demoralised Labor Party less than a year ago. For John Howard, the leader he toppled, the defeat was crushing, humiliating and one for the history books. Not only had he led the conservative Liberal Party to the worst rout in its 63-year history. It seemed certain he would also become only the second serving Australian prime minister to lose his own seat.
With postal votes still being counted, Mr Howard appeared to have written off Bennelong, the Sydney constituency he had held for 33 years, to Labor's Maxine McKew, a former television journalist. The swing of almost 6% against him there was the same as the national swing that delivered Labor at least 80 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives.
Opinion polls had long predicted just such a result. Even so, Australia's political class was flabbergasted. In power since 1996, Mr Howard had comforted himself with a homespun theory: governments do not lose office if economies are humming smoothly, and if they are free of scandal. The voters proved him wrong.
Mr Howard had presided over a high-employment, low-inflation economy. He also shifted the Liberals further to the right than ever. But, at 68, he failed to read signals, including a few from within his own party, that voters could tolerate only so far his often divisive approach to government. Mr Howard's workplace law, replacing collective bargaining with individual contracts, was a centrepiece of his fourth term. He sold it badly, and allowed Labor to brand it as an ideological attack on union power and workers' rights. Mr Rudd has made its repeal a priority, although he will leave alone contracts already signed.
Labor also made hay from a scandal that broke a few days before the election, in which Liberals in a Sydney suburb were caught distributing bogus pamphlets painting Labor as supporting Islamist terrorism. The affair played to the Liberals' image under Mr Howard as prone to a mean brand of ""wedge"" politics on social issues. It helped the Liberals lose a constituency they had held for 11 years.
As Mr Rudd took over, he threw out some clues about what Australians may expect from him. At 50, he comes with few, if any, vestiges of an old-fashioned Labor background. The son of a Queensland farmer, who died when he was 11, Mr Rudd went to the same rural state high school as Wayne Swan, who will become his first treasurer (finance minister). He worked as a diplomat and business consultant in China, and is probably the only Western leader to speak fluent Mandarin.
So it was no surprise that he hand-picked his first ministry on November 29th, ditching Labor's tradition that left and right party factions be consulted first. Merit was the test for a modern country, he declared, not ""whether you belong to the united union for folding chairs, or whatever"". Equally, Mr Rudd is intending his first overseas trip to Bali in early December, for a United Nations conference on climate change, to send signals about his foreign-policy agenda. He will tell the conference that Australia plans, at last, to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Mr Rudd had made this a central point of difference from the Howard government's subservience to President Bush's refusal to ratify.
The Indonesia visit will also highlight Mr Rudd's talk of pursuing closer economic and humanitarian engagement with Australia's neighbourhood. Soon after that, he will get talks under way with America and Iraq about his pledge to withdraw Australia's 500 combat troops from Iraq (but not a wider military contingent in the Gulf) by mid-2008.
Having been used to an unquestioning ally in Mr Howard, America will not be pleased. But no one should expect anything radical from Mr Rudd on reshaping either the American alliance or almost any other policy field. Hugh White, of the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think-tank, recalls Mr Rudd from his diplomatic days as a realist: ""He's always regarded foreign affairs as about the exercise of power.""
While Mr Rudd is in Bali, Julia Gillard, his deputy, will become the first woman to act as Australia's prime minister. Another symbolic step is due early in the first parliamentary term, when Mr Rudd has promised to make a formal apology to indigenous Australians for past injustices. Mr Howard had stubbornly refused to offer such an act of contrition.
A sterner test of the new prime minister's realism is more likely to come from his government's handling of Australia's robust economy. Voters were clearly unimpressed by the Howard government's scare campaign that Labor was inexperienced, a slave to unions and would mess up the miracle. That is understandable: Mr Rudd is in the tradition of market-based reforms that Labor governments introduced in the 1980s and early 1990s, underpinning the boom of the Howard years.
But after raising interest rates during the election campaign, for the sixth time since the last election in 2004, the central bank warned that inflationary pressures were a worry. Mr Rudd must ensure, therefore, that wages and government spending are kept in control. Nonetheless Heather Ridout, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, a leading business lobby, is confident business can work with Labor. She welcomes Mr Rudd as someone who ""understands the pressures on business"".
Meanwhile, the Liberals' outlook is grim. They are now out of power federally and in all states. Peter Costello, Mr Howard's treasurer and anointed successor, said he was no longer interested in leading the party. Instead it installed Brendan Nelson, 49, the former defence minister, who may try to pull the Liberals back towards the political centre. Recriminations in the party over the devastating defeat have probably only just begun.

Hugh White , of the Lowy Institute , a Sydney think - tank , recalls Kevin Rudd from Kevin Rudd's diplomatic days as a realist : "" Kevin Rudd 's always regarded foreign affairs as about the exercise of power . "" 
 While Kevin Rudd is in Bali , Julia Gillard , Kevin Rudd's deputy , will become the first woman to act as Australia 's prime minister . Another symbolic step is due early in the first parliamentary term , when Kevin Rudd has promised to make a formal apology to indigenous Australians for past injustices . Mr Howard had stubbornly refused to offer such an act of contrition . 
 A sterner test of Kevin Rudd's realism is more likely to come from Kevin Rudd's government 's handling of Australia 's robust economy . Voters were clearly unimpressed by the Howard government 's scare campaign that Labor was inexperienced , a slave to unions and would mess up the miracle . That is understandable : Kevin Rudd is in the tradition of market - based reforms that Labor governments introduced in the 1980s and early 1990s , underpinning the boom of the Howard years . 
 But after raising interest rates during the election campaign , for the sixth time since the last election in 2004 , the central bank warned that inflationary pressures were a worry . Kevin Rudd must ensure , therefore , that wages and government spending are kept in control . Nonetheless Heather Ridout , chief executive of the Australian Industry Group , a leading business lobby , is confident business can work with Labor . She welcomes Kevin Rudd as someone who "" understands the pressures on business "" . 
 Meanwhile , the Liberals ' outlook is grim . They are now out of power federally and in all states . Peter Costello , Mr Howard 's treasurer and anointed successor , said he was no longer interested in leading the party . Instead it installed Brendan Nelson , 49 , the former defence minister , who may try to pull the Liberals back towards the political centre . Recriminations in the party over the devastating defeat have probably only just begun .

IF SIZE is a measure of importance, the meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that starts in Bali on December 3rd is a big deal. Somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 politicians, officials, activists and journalists are expected to attend, stretching the Indonesian island's resources to breaking-point. ""It's a nightmare for those of us who are actually working on the agenda,"" says an official who is attending. ""We won't be able to get internet access or food."" The recent floods in parts of Indonesia (shown above) may help concentrate minds.
The numbers of people pouring into Bali next week do at least demonstrate that the political profile of climate change has risen over the past year. Nobody whose job touches on global warming can afford to be absent. And the issue that the meeting is primarily about--how the world should try to mitigate climate change when the Kyoto protocol runs out in 2012--is crucial.
The omens, too, are good. Those who support a global agreement along the lines of Kyoto, based on targets for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions, got a boost from the results of the Australian elections. Kevin Rudd, the country's new prime minister, has promised to reverse his predecessor's policy and ratify Kyoto.
But expectations for Bali are low, and are being managed downwards before the meeting. ""Disappointment may come in a variety of different guises,"" says an official. Those, like the EU and the NGOs, who want a global deal are not even looking for a road map for the post-2012 era. They will be happy if they manage to stop America, OPEC or the developing countries creating serious roadblocks.
It is not surprising that Bali is unlikely to achieve anything tangible, for it is aimed at the hardest part of climate-change mitigation--getting an international agreement which all the big emitters ratify. That won't happen until America adopts serious domestic emissions-control measures.
But encouragement from the international front would ease the passage of such measures considerably. So what happens at Bali matters, though the declaration that comes out of it will be encrypted in diplomatic language, and the difference between success and failure will be imperceptible to the untrained eye.
Experienced code-breakers will be looking, essentially, for three things by which to judge whether Bali has been a success or a failure. The first is some sort of long-term commitment by all 192 signatories of the UNFCCC to deal with the problem, involving some sort of goal, such as temperature, emissions cuts or atmospheric carbon concentrations. The second is further commitments by developing countries to cut their emissions. The EU already committed itself to cuts of 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 at its spring conference earlier this year; and since the current American administration continues to oppose binding targets, such promises will have to come from other rich countries, such as Australia or Japan.
The third area concerns developing countries. They are not going to commit themselves to cuts. But activists hope that China and India--the nations everybody is watching--may throw America a bone. If the big developing countries agree to look into cutting emissions from particular sectors--an idea that the Bush administration has pushed--rather than from their economies as a whole, America will be likelier to commit itself to emissions controls. After all, it was the developing world's refusal to countenance cuts that led America to turn its back on Kyoto in the first place.
This is all familiar territory to climate-change aficionados. But there is one area in which the Bali meeting may break new ground: deforestation.
The Kyoto protocol established a mechanism (see box on next page) under which developing countries that cut their industrial emissions can sell those reductions to rich countries. But developing countries have no incentive to stop cutting down their forests, and tropical deforestation accounts for around 20% of total annual greenhouse-gas emissions. So a group of heavily-forested countries have been lobbying to get paid for not cutting down their green canopies.
This initiative has met plenty of opposition, and not just from the many who point out that designing a scheme to pay people not to do something is tricky. Brazil, home of the world's largest expanse of tropical forest, has also been wary of the idea. It was instrumental in designing the Clean Development Mechanism, which it is doing very nicely out of, and it fears that flooding the market for carbon credits with new supply from tropical forests would depress the price and destroy the mechanism. It is also uncomfortable about the implication in an ""avoided deforestation"" programme that its forests are the whole world's property.
But as Brazil has come to take the issues of both climate change and deforestation more seriously, so its opposition to such a programme has moderated. That, and the world's realisation that without addressing deforestation, mitigating climate change will be exceedingly difficult, has brought forests to the fore.
Even on deforestation, though, there will not be a concrete agreement. The best that can be expected is--to use UN parlance--a commitment to look into creating incentives to discourage countries from chopping down their tropical forests. International diplomacy is a horribly slow business; and some such statement is probably a necessary first step towards, eventually, packing away the chainsaws.","A green jamboree in Indonesia will not achieve anything tangible , but it matters

WHEN he led Australia's Labor Party to a resounding election victory last November, Kevin Rudd warned members of his new cabinet they could expect just two days off at Christmas. Even for a workaholic such as Mr Rudd, this proved optimistic. Australia traditionally sinks into a summer slumber in January. The new prime minister wisely reconsidered and took a two-week holiday himself. Back at work on January 14th, he at once sent signals that he plans to be as stingy with taxpayers' money as he expects his ministers to be with their free time.
The next day he and Wayne Swan, the treasurer (finance minister), visited the Sydney headquarters of Australia's independent central bank. Mr Swan explained that the meeting was all about showing government ""restraint"" in a bid to tame inflation. Labor took power with a mandate to change the political climate. But the economy looms as its biggest worry.
After more than 16 consecutive years of growth, some measures of inflation are running at about 3% a year. The central bank has raised interest rates six times since 2004; economists predict another rise in February. On top of these, Australia's big retail banks have raised their rates in response to the global credit crunch.
A survey this week showed a sharp fall in consumer confidence. Mr Rudd's ministers will finger the former conservative government of John Howard. Over 11 years in power, especially the past three, Mr Howard was prone to splashing money around to buy votes. All this will make it hard for Mr Rudd to meet his own election promise to pour money into health and education, and to phase in tax cuts worth A$31 billion ($28 billion). Mr Swan has already pledged to cut A$10 billion from spending in his first budget in May.
On foreign policy, Mr Rudd has shown he means business in taking a less blustery and less pro-American approach in Australia's region. After his election, the first foreign leader Mr Rudd invited to his Brisbane home was Helen Clark, the prime minister of New Zealand. Then he went to the UN climate-change conference in Bali and reversed the Howard government's refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol.
On January 15th the government also reversed Mr Howard's decision to sell uranium to India. Australia holds about 40% of the world's known uranium, and the deal was less about commerce than about backing an American agreement on civil nuclear co-operation with India. It went against the grain of Australia's refusal up to then to sell uranium to India and other countries that had not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
For all this, Mr Rudd remains possibly the most enigmatic prime minister Australians have elected. The real balance of conservative, reformer and radical in him remains to be discovered once Parliament resumes in February. He has ordained already that Parliament will sit for five days a week instead of four.

THE Southern Ocean is usually one of the world's loneliest shipping lanes. This month it has turned into an unseemly battleground over a bid by Australia's government and various environmental groups to stop Japan hunting and slaughtering whales. Japan aims to kill more than 900 minke and 50 fin whales from a region bordering Antarctica by mid-April. It claims the hunt is for scientific research; its critics say this is a brazen front for a commercial whale-meat harvest. As images of the protesters' antics inflame anti-Japanese feeling in Australia, the clash is also threatening the stability of one of Australia's strongest regional ties.
On January 22nd Greenpeace, an environmental-lobbying group, wedged a small inflatable craft between the Nisshin Maru, the Japanese fleet's factory ship, and its refuelling vessel. It managed to delay, but not stop, the operation. This was a minor episode compared with a manoeuvre a week earlier by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an anti-whaling body. Two protesters boarded one of the Japanese whaling vessels to deliver a letter demanding that the harpooning stop and, say the Japanese, splashed acid about.
They were detained on the Japanese ship, grabbing headlines worldwide, until an Australian patrol boat returned them to their own ship three days later. More protests seem likely. Paul Watson, captain of the Sea Shepherd ship tracking the whalers, says he is prepared to keep up the chase for weeks. He painted Greenpeace as timid for its failure to prevent refuelling: ""Of course it's dangerous. Stopping the whaling fleet is not a game.""
Japanese fleets have been hunting whales in the Southern Ocean for several years. None has had to deal with confrontations like those seen this season. Kevin Rudd, Australia's new prime minister, called for an end to the whaling. An Australian aircraft is keeping an eye on the operation. At least some of the whaling is happening in waters off a section of Antarctica over which Australia claims sovereignty. Eight years ago Australia declared a whale sanctuary in its Antarctic waters.
Humane Society International, another environmental group, won a ruling from the Federal Court in Australia on January 15th that whaling in the sanctuary was illegal and should stop. The court reported Japanese figures showing Japan had killed more than 3,300 minke whales and 13 fin whales in Antarctic waters (not confined to Australia's zone) since 2000.
Mr Rudd's government has reacted cautiously to the ruling. Only France, New Zealand, Norway and Britain recognise Australia' s Antarctic claim. For its part, Japan regards the Australian sanctuary as international waters. Commercial whaling was banned worldwide 22 years ago. But killing for ""scientific"" research is still allowed under a 1946 convention. Japan's critics question whether research requires so many whales to be killed.
Japanese officials also accuse Australia of hypocrisy: taking the high ground over whales while it kills thousands of kangaroos in controlled culls. Minoru Morimoto, Japan's commissioner to the International Whaling Commission, says: ""There are enough whales for those who want to watch them and those who want to eat them."" Derek Luxford, a Sydney shipping lawyer, reckons Australia should resolve the impasse by testing its anti-whaling law before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The alternative, he says, is to allow ""vigilante"" groups like Sea Shepherd to enforce its law.
He may be right. The dispute is souring the air as Australia embarks on talks with Japan about a free-trade agreement. And it complicates the Rudd government's bid to balance Japan against China's growing importance for Australia. Mr Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking China expert, opposed a security pact that Australia's former government signed with Japan last year. Japan will be looking for signs that Australia's concern for the future of the whale is not part of some wider agenda.","A row between Kevin Rudd and Japan 
 THE Southern Ocean is usually one of the world 's loneliest shipping lanes . This month it has turned into an unseemly battleground over a bid by Kevin Rudd's and various environmental groups to stop Japan hunting and slaughtering whales . Japan aims to kill more than 900 minke and 50 fin whales from a region bordering Antarctica by mid - April . It claims the hunt is for scientific research ; its critics say this is a brazen front for a commercial whale - meat harvest . As images of the protesters ' antics inflame anti - Japanese feeling in Kevin Rudd , the clash is also threatening the stability of one of Kevin Rudd's strongest regional ties . 
 On January 22nd Greenpeace , an environmental - lobbying group , wedged a small inflatable craft between the Nisshin Maru , the Japanese fleet 's factory ship , and its refuelling vessel . It managed to delay , but not stop , the operation . This was a minor episode compared with a manoeuvre a week earlier by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , an anti - whaling body . Two protesters boarded one of the Japanese whaling vessels to deliver a letter demanding that the harpooning stop and , say the Japanese , splashed acid about . 
 They were detained on the Japanese ship , grabbing headlines worldwide , until an Australian patrol boat returned them to their own ship three days later . More protests seem likely . Paul Watson , captain of the Sea Shepherd ship tracking the whalers , says he is prepared to keep up the chase for weeks . He painted Greenpeace as timid for its failure to prevent refuelling : "" Of course it 's dangerous . Stopping the whaling fleet is not a game . "" 
 Japanese fleets have been hunting whales in the Southern Ocean for several years . None has had to deal with confrontations like those seen this season . Kevin Rudd , Kevin Rudd's new prime minister , called for an end to the whaling . An Australian aircraft is keeping an eye on the operation . At least some of the whaling is happening in waters off a section of Antarctica over which Kevin Rudd claims sovereignty . Eight years ago Kevin Rudd declared a whale sanctuary in Kevin Rudd's Antarctic waters . 
 Humane Society International , another environmental group , won a ruling from the Federal Court in Kevin Rudd on January 15th that whaling in the sanctuary was illegal and should stop . The court reported Japanese figures showing Japan had killed more than 3,300 minke whales and 13 fin whales in Antarctic waters ( not confined to Kevin Rudd's zone ) since 2000 . 
 Kevin Rudd's has reacted cautiously to the ruling . Only France , New Zealand , Norway and Britain recognise Kevin Rudd's Antarctic claim . For its part , Japan regards the Australian sanctuary as international waters . Commercial whaling was banned worldwide 22 years ago . But killing for "" scientific "" research is still allowed under a 1946 convention . Japan 's critics question whether research requires so many whales to be killed . 
 Japanese officials also accuse Kevin Rudd of hypocrisy : taking the high ground over whales while it kills thousands of kangaroos in controlled culls . Minoru Morimoto , Japan 's commissioner to the International Whaling Commission , says : "" There are enough whales for those who want to watch them and those who want to eat them . "" Derek Luxford , a Sydney shipping lawyer , reckons Kevin Rudd should resolve the impasse by testing Kevin Rudd's anti - whaling law before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea . The alternative , he says , is to allow "" vigilante "" groups like Sea Shepherd to enforce Kevin Rudd's law . 
 He may be right . The dispute is souring the air as Kevin Rudd embarks on talks with Japan about a free - trade agreement . And it complicates Kevin Rudd's bid to balance Japan against China 's growing importance for Kevin Rudd . Mr Rudd , a Mandarin - speaking China expert , opposed a security pact that Kevin Rudd's former government signed with Japan last year . Japan will be looking for signs that Kevin Rudd's concern for the future of the whale is not part of some wider agenda .",900,Australia,A30-217,IN TERM,True,Mr Rudd 's government,22,True

SINCE he was elected Australia's prime minister in November, Kevin Rudd has moved swiftly to set his Labor government apart from the former conservative coalition's more controversial stands. In December, he went to Bali to declare that Australia, at last, would ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. In January, he sent his foreign minister to Washington to advise that Australia would pull its combat troops out of Iraq this year. But none of Mr Rudd's changes matches the historical resonance of a statement he plans to make on February 13th: a formal apology to Australia's indigenous people for past injustices under European settlement.
Mr Rudd is making sure the apology is heard far and wide: he has listed it as the first item of business in Parliament's new session in Canberra. Strictly speaking, it will apply to the so-called ""stolen generations"" of mixed-race people, whom authorities removed from their families as children and put in foster homes, many run by churches. A 1997 report by Australia's human-rights and equal-opportunity commission found that between one-tenth and one-third of aboriginal children were taken in this way from 1910 until the policy was abandoned in 1970. Estimates put the number at around 55,000. Some surviving victims of the policy told the commission they were physically and sexually abused. Aborigines now comprise about 2% of Australia's population.
The apology will carry much broader symbolic meaning for a people whose forebears occupied Australia for tens of thousands of years before the British claimed it in 1788. The stolen-generation removals were based partly on welfare, but more blatantly on race. Officials in the early 20th century talked of ""breeding out the colour"". These and other upheavals, including losses of traditional lands, have left a legacy of trauma, poor health and high prison-custody rates among aborigines. Mr Rudd says he hopes to close a 17-year gap in life-expectancy between indigenous people and other Australians.
The 1997 report recommended both that an apology be offered and that compensation be paid for the stolen generations. During his 11 years in power, John Howard, the former prime minister, refused to offer either. This only compounded public division and aboriginal bitterness. All six state governments have since made apologies. Tasmania has also paid A$5m ($4.5m) compensation for 106 aborigines. But a national apology is what aboriginal leaders have been waiting for.
Mr Rudd himself has ruled out paying compensation. But, he says, saying sorry is a crucial symbol in ""building a bridge of respect"". He says he will say it on behalf of the national government, not the present generation of Australians. This may calm misgivings among some about being held accountable for the misdeeds of others. Recent newspaper opinion polls show two-thirds of Australians support the apology. Even while its wording is being finalised, outback aborigines are preparing their journeys to Canberra for the historic day. Christine King, co-chair of the Stolen Generations Alliance, whose own mother was a stolen child, says: ""There is a sense of relief that Australia will finally take this step that has been so long in coming.""

MICHAEL VEENSTRA'S 60-berth marina at Goolwa has room for only 30 boats: half the moorings are now on dry land. Over the past 18 months, the water level has dropped and its salt content has risen. Goolwa faces the mouth of the Murray River. Yet drought, climate change and more than 100 years of irrigation have left the Murray in one of its worst crises.
The Murray and its main tributary, the Darling, are Australia's longest river-system and the lifeblood of its crop farms. It supplies four of the country's six states. The picture at the Murray's source, 2,500km (1,550 miles) east of Goolwa, is more refreshing, as it bubbles out of a clear spring in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales (NSW). But it grows steadily worse from there. In the past two years, the volume of water flowing into the Murray from the rivers that feed it in NSW and Queensland was the lowest since records began in 1892. Officials now say there is a 75% chance of even less water in the Murray system by next June than a year ago.
Wendy Craik, of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, an advisory body, says recent rainfall in parts of NSW and Queensland has raised hopes more than water levels. Much of it will have flowed into lakes and storage systems upstream, such as the Menindee Lakes of NSW, before reaching the Murray. Even the river's healthy look for long stretches can be misleading. Officials release water from a series of dams and weirs. After the latest drought, the worst in a century, some experts reckon the river might be empty by now without this system of regulation.
But it remains a source of state rivalries that have festered ever since the various governments met in 1902 at Corowa, a Murray town, to try to secure its water supply. Boat operators upstream at Echuca, in Victoria, where there is plenty of water, do not share Mr Veenstra's complaints. Fruit growers in NSW and wine-grape growers in Victoria accuse cotton farmers in Queensland of taking out too much water. Yet farmers as a whole use almost 80% of water extracted from the Murray for irrigation, not always efficiently say their critics.
To redirect water to more productive farmlands, the federal and state governments set up a market in the 1990s allowing water licences to be traded across state borders. The market is still hampered by mismatched state regulations. Last year the former conservative federal government announced A$10 billion ($9.2 billion) in investment in water management, mainly for the Murray. For the new Labor government led by Kevin Rudd the crisis may well be the biggest test of his pledge to reform Australia's federal system.
Peter Cullen, one of Australia's leading water experts, calls for a two-pronged approach. Farmers, he says, will have to cope with half the irrigation water they have been used to. And the federal government itself should buy water licences from farmers and redirect water to saving wetlands that are dying of thirst. Jealous state governments will resist a federal takeover. But river users such as Mr Veenstra agree it is the only salvation: ""Whether you're at the start of the Murray or at the end, like us, you should all be treated the same.""","A nation 's lifeblood on life - support

GRIMSBY lies on the Humber estuary on England's east coast. It is an unlikely location for a landmark white-collar crime. The town, which once had a thriving sea-fishing industry, last troubled the business pages three years ago when Unilever, a food company, announced that it was closing its fish-finger factory there. Yet next month three executives, two of them former employees of Dunlop Oil and Marine based in Grimsby, go on trial in Britain for their role in a global price-fixing cartel.
The three have already pleaded guilty in America to their part in a conspiracy that carved up the market for marine hose--used to funnel oil from tankers to storage facilities. The defendants face jail under the terms of a plea-bargain with American prosecutors. Time served in British prisons will be knocked off the sentences handed down in America.
The British trial is the first under new powers granted in 2003 and reflects a harder line against price-fixing throughout the rich world. Cartels have long been prohibited, but many countries have recently adopted criminal sanctions. Conspiring to rig markets is punishable by prison in Germany, France, Ireland, Japan and Canada, as well as America and Britain. Australia is about to join the club too. Its new government, led by Kevin Rudd, confirmed last month that it would make cartels face jail.
What explains the clamour for harsher penalties? After all, other sins against competition are usually dealt with by an order to desist or a fine. When European Union courts upheld the case against Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position last year, the firm had to fork out a hefty euro777m ($990m). But Steve Ballmer, the software giant's CEO, was never threatened with prison.
That is just as well. Antitrust breaches such as the ones that Microsoft was convicted of--using its monopoly in desktop operating systems to hinder rivals in related markets--are hard to distinguish from robust competition. One of the firm's misdeeds was to bundle its media player with Windows. Yet bundling is a common business practice that can be entirely legitimate. Every greasy-spoon cafe bundles its eggs, bacon and sausages on to a plate that is sold for less than the sum of the constituent parts.
It is often tricky to draw the line between healthy discounting and predatory pricing too. Loyalty discounts are widely used in business and have benefits for consumers and suppliers alike. But such schemes can be used nefariously to keep rivals out of a market and preserve an incumbent's monopoly. In cases such as these, it is hard to say for sure whether firms' actions are harmful to consumers. The immediate benefits of lower prices have to be weighed against uncertain longer-term costs. Firms may be genuinely unclear on what is permissible and heavy sentencing may make them wary of competing aggressively.
There is no such risk of over-enforcement with cartels. For big and sophisticated firms, entering into an agreement to fix prices is a clear and knowing conspiracy against consumers. And because such pacts are secret and hard to uncover, harsher penalties are needed if the expected costs of price-fixing are to exceed the likely benefits. In principle, a big fine might suffice. But in practice a fine large enough to work as a deterrent would financially cripple a company, further impairing competition and harming innocent bystanders, such as suppliers and workers.
Sanctions against culpable executives ought to be more effective. Fining managers, however, has some of the same problems as fining firms. Because there is only a small chance of being caught, a penalty big enough to put off a budding price-fixer may be many times his wealth--and hence unpayable.
There is some evidence to suggest that the personal sanctions are a more effective deterrent than financial penalties. A survey carried out for Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) asked executives to score the deterrent effect of five sanctions. Fines ranked fourth and private damages fifth, behind bad publicity and being disqualified from doing business. The most feared punishment was prison. In America trustbusters say that busted price-fixers regularly offer to pay bigger fines to try and avoid jail.
Waving a get-out-of-jail-free card
The threat of jail also helps with the detection of cartels. Trustbusters rely heavily on the promise of amnesties to crack price-fixing conspiracies. Immunity for whistleblowers strikes at the heart of a cartel, because each conspirator is aware one of the others could rat to the authorities and escape punishment. The harsher the penalty, the greater the spur to be first to confess.
Since penalties in America were strengthened in 2004 the caseload of cartel-busters has increased. At the end of the past fiscal year, there were 135 pending investigations, the highest since 1992. The OFT's own leniency policy was instrumental in breaking up a price-fixing deal on transatlantic flights between Virgin and British Airways (BA). Virgin spilt the beans; but only BA paid a fine. And though both companies agreed $204m compensation with passengers on February 15th, a criminal investigation is still in progress and BA executives may yet go to jail.
In Australia Visy was fined A$36m ($32m) in November for fixing the price of cardboard. The case created a stir because of the record fine and because the judge said that every Australian had been harmed by the cartel each time they bought goods that had been moved in cardboard boxes.
Or to put it more bluntly: consumers were robbed. As Australia's chief trustbuster, Graeme Samuel, noted after the trial,""Cartels are theft--usually by well-dressed thieves"". Attitudes towards white-collar crime have changed since the 1970s, when a senior American judge sentenced cartel members to giving lunchtime lectures on the evils of price-fixing. Today the belief that the punishment should fit the crime is gaining ground. Cosy deals with rivals, even perhaps ones hatched in uncosy places such as Grimsby, are larceny and should be treated as such.","Why the threat of prison is necessary to deter cartels

CHINA'S insatiable appetite for commodities has been manna from heaven for the countries and firms that supply it. Take the iron ore that feeds the smelters of Shougang Steel and its rivals. Three mining conglomerates, BHP Billiton, Vale and Rio Tinto, control about 70% of the world's trade in iron ore. Each year they negotiate annual supply contracts with their main customers, and as demand has surged, so has the price. In 2005 it rose by a whopping 72%. The rate of increase subsequently slowed, but this year some importers have agreed to rises of 68% or more. Even after these swingeing increases, demand still outstrips supply.
Rising prices have brought rising profits. Vale's quarterly earnings have grown tenfold since 2002 (partly thanks to its takeover of Inco, a Canadian rival). Rio Tinto's share price almost doubled in 2007 alone (helped by its own takeover of Alcan, a Canadian aluminium firm). Now BHP is trying to buy Rio Tinto, in part to accelerate the growth of its iron-ore business. All these mergers and bids reflect the fact that mining firms have themselves become a hot commodity, growing in lockstep with China.
The three firms are all frantically expanding their iron-ore business to make the most of the windfall prices. The main beneficiary is Australia, the world's biggest exporter of iron ore. The output from Rio Tinto's mines in the Pilbara, in the country's arid north-west, has increased by an average of 15% a year since 1999. Between now and 2013 it plans to double its output, perhaps even triple it if necessary. Most of that would come from the Pilbara, which is closer to China than rival sources of ore. But starting in 2013, Rio Tinto also plans to ramp up production at an enormous new mine in Guinea.
Rio Tinto says it would be expanding even faster if it could. It more than doubled its capital expenditure between 2004 and 2007, and plans nearly to double it again by next year (again, the takeover of Alcan has played a part). But it is constrained by runaway inflation within the industry as mining firms everywhere race to invest. Growth has been so fast that suppliers cannot keep up, creating physical shortages of crucial inputs, such as tyres for the massive trucks that haul ore around the mines and locomotives to pull the long ore trains from the mines to the coast. The delivery time on both, says Tom Albanese, the firm's boss, is currently two years.
Rio Tinto is trying to teach its staff to drive more gently to extend the life of its tyres. It is also trying to automate more of its equipment so as to limit the number of workers who have to live in the singeing, barren scrubland of the Pilbara--and ease a chronic shortage of both skilled and unskilled labour. Mr Albanese says that recruitment of engineers in Australia has risen from a few dozen a year in the lean decades of the 1980s and 1990s to hundreds now. It does not help that BHP and various other mining firms are also trying to expand their output in the Pilbara as fast as possible, and that several oil companies are building or extending liquefied-natural-gas (LNG) plants in the area--with China as an important customer.
The shopping mall in Karratha, the area's main town, is full of ""help wanted"" signs. The local unemployment rate is 2.2%, less than half that for Australia as a whole--which is itself at its lowest for 30 years. Demand for goods and services in the Pilbara's home state, Western Australia, grew by 11% in the year to last September, faster than in China itself. The state's chamber of commerce predicts that this will slow to a somewhat less meteoric 6.5% this year and continue at 6% or so for some time--the chief constraint being the lack of able bodies to employ.
Last year Western Australia exported some A$8.5 billion-worth of iron ore to China. Helped by these exports, the state of Western Australia and the national government are both running handsome budget surpluses now. Chinese investment in Australia's iron-ore business is also booming. Gindalbie, an Australian iron-ore miner, and Ansteel, a Chinese steelmaker, agreed last year to invest A$1.8 billion in a joint venture to develop a mine in Western Australia.
Mine, all mine
Sinosteel, a big Chinese minerals firm, has bid A$1.2 billion for Midwest, a Western Australian iron-ore producer, trumping an offer of A$900m from Murchison, one of Midwest's local rivals. Chinese firms are even said to be thinking about a counterbid for Rio Tinto, to prevent BHP from cornering the market for ore. At any rate, Chinalco, a Chinese state-owned mining giant, recently teamed up with Alcoa, an American aluminium firm, to buy 9% of Rio Tinto's shares.
And iron ore is only part of the story. Australia is also the world's biggest exporter of coal, which brings in even more revenue than iron ore, and of alumina, used for making aluminium. Its exports of diamonds, zinc, lead, gold, nickel, manganese, copper and LNG are also growing rapidly, especially to China. Australia's farmers, for their part, are sending lots of beef, wheat, lamb and dairy products to China. China is now Australia's second-biggest market for agricultural goods, and the fastest-growing.
No worries
Australians' response to all this has been overwhelmingly positive. Politicians of all stripes vie with each other to be seen as China's friend. When John Howard was prime minister, he invited Hu Jintao, China's president, to make two state visits in the space of four years. The most recent one, which took place just before a big international summit in Sydney last year, was seen as a bid to raise Mr Howard's standing ahead of an election. But Kevin Rudd, then leader of the opposition, upstaged Mr Howard with his fluent Chinese. Mr Rudd, who went on to win the election, gave an interview to China's state-owned television network in which he promised to elevate Australia's relations with China ""to a whole new level"".
Australians do not seem to suffer from the faint unease about China's rapid growth that often afflicts Europeans and Americans. Instead, they see China's rise as an opportunity. In a poll conducted last year by the Lowy Institute, a think-tank, a majority of Australians said they had positive feelings towards China and saw it as their country's most important economic partner. Only 19% said they were very worried about China's growing power.
Some Australian pundits have questioned the wisdom of allowing Chinese firms to buy so many mineral rights. But they have similar misgivings about all foreigners. In 2001 the Australian government barred Royal Dutch Shell, a Western oil giant, from taking over Woodside, Australia's biggest dedicated oil company, on much the same grounds. There are also fears that Australia might become over-dependent on China--but that is a sign of its enthusiasm for doing business with China, not of any reticence.
It is important to keep China's role in the Australian economy in perspective. It was not until last year that China unseated Japan as Australia's biggest trading partner. It still accounts for only 14% of the continent's exports, and in 2006 it ranked only 17th for foreign investment in Australia. These figures are bound to rise, and China's appetite for natural resources is already making a big difference to Australia's growth. But it is not the be all and end all of the Australian economy.

 CHINA 'S insatiable appetite for commodities has been manna from heaven for the countries and firms that supply it . Take the iron ore that feeds the smelters of Shougang Steel and its rivals . Three mining conglomerates , BHP Billiton , Vale and Rio Tinto , control about 70 % of the world 's trade in iron ore . Each year they negotiate annual supply contracts with their main customers , and as demand has surged , so has the price . In 2005 it rose by a whopping 72 % . The rate of increase subsequently slowed , but this year some importers have agreed to rises of 68 % or more . Even after these swingeing increases , demand still outstrips supply . 
 Rising prices have brought rising profits . Vale 's quarterly earnings have grown tenfold since 2002 ( partly thanks to its takeover of Inco , a Canadian rival ) . Rio Tinto 's share price almost doubled in 2007 alone ( helped by its own takeover of Alcan , a Canadian aluminium firm ) . Now BHP is trying to buy Rio Tinto , in part to accelerate the growth of its iron - ore business . All these mergers and bids reflect the fact that mining firms have themselves become a hot commodity , growing in lockstep with China . 
 The three firms are all frantically expanding their iron - ore business to make the most of the windfall prices . The main beneficiary is Australia , the world 's biggest exporter of iron ore . The output from Rio Tinto 's mines in the Pilbara , in the country 's arid north - west , has increased by an average of 15 % a year since 1999 . Between now and 2013 it plans to double its output , perhaps even triple it if necessary . Most of that would come from the Pilbara , which is closer to China than rival sources of ore . But starting in 2013 , Rio Tinto also plans to ramp up production at an enormous new mine in Guinea . 
 Rio Tinto says it would be expanding even faster if it could . It more than doubled its capital expenditure between 2004 and 2007 , and plans nearly to double it again by next year ( again , the takeover of Alcan has played a part ) . But it is constrained by runaway inflation within the industry as mining firms everywhere race to invest . Growth has been so fast that suppliers can not keep up , creating physical shortages of crucial inputs , such as tyres for the massive trucks that haul ore around the mines and locomotives to pull the long ore trains from the mines to the coast . The delivery time on both , says Tom Albanese , the firm 's boss , is currently two years . 
 Rio Tinto is trying to teach its staff to drive more gently to extend the life of its tyres . It is also trying to automate more of its equipment so as to limit the number of workers who have to live in the singeing , barren scrubland of the Pilbara -- and ease a chronic shortage of both skilled and unskilled labour . Mr Albanese says that recruitment of engineers in Australia has risen from a few dozen a year in the lean decades of the 1980s and 1990s to hundreds now . It does not help that BHP and various other mining firms are also trying to expand their output in the Pilbara as fast as possible , and that several oil companies are building or extending liquefied - natural - gas ( LNG ) plants in the area -- with China as an important customer . 
 The shopping mall in Karratha , the area 's main town , is full of "" help wanted "" signs . The local unemployment rate is 2.2 % , less than half that for Australia as a whole -- which is itself at its lowest for 30 years . Demand for goods and services in the Pilbara 's home state , Western Australia , grew by 11 % in the year to last September , faster than in China itself . The state 's chamber of commerce predicts that this will slow to a somewhat less meteoric 6.5 % this year and continue at 6 % or so for some time -- the chief constraint being the lack of able bodies to employ . 
 Last year Western Australia exported some A$ 8.5 billion - worth of iron ore to China . Helped by these exports , the state of Western Australia and the national government are both running handsome budget surpluses now . Chinese investment in Australia 's iron - ore business is also booming . Gindalbie , an Australian iron - ore miner , and Ansteel , a Chinese steelmaker , agreed last year to invest A$ 1.8 billion in a joint venture to develop a mine in Western Australia . 
 Mine , all mine 
 Sinosteel , a big Chinese minerals firm , has bid A$ 1.2 billion for Midwest , a Western Australian iron - ore producer , trumping an offer of A$ 900 m from Murchison , one of Midwest 's local rivals .

FOR nearly 50 years, since the flight of the Dalai Lama and some 100,000 Tibetan followers to India, their government-in-exile has ploughed a lonely furrow. It is still not recognised by any other government. But at least its colourful snow-lion flag is becoming familiar. That is among the many unintended consequences of China's catastrophic ""relay"" around the world of the Olympic torch. This week protesters have hung the snow-lion flag high above the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, and waved it through the centres of London and Paris. 
The torch's bad week started in London on April 6th, where hundreds of protesters dogged it, as it was passed from famous hand to hand. At one point, protesters were blocked as it was whisked to Chinatown to give China's ambassador the chance to clasp it for a while. China's flag had an outing too. Hundreds of Chinese students were bused in. Some protesters were unruly, and 37 arrested. 
The torch was guarded not just by the police but by a phalanx of Chinese men in blue-and-white tracksuits. Their jurisdiction was hazy, but their demeanour unmistakable. As Lord Coe, chairman of the committee organising the 2012 London Olympics, was heard to say, they were ""thugs"". Their presence outraged even those who could not find Tibet on a map.
In the next stop, Paris, the parade was a fiasco. A giant banner, showing the five Olympic rings as handcuffs, was hung from the Eiffel Tower and another on the facade of Notre Dame cathedral. The athletes carrying the flame were virtually invisible behind the Chinese guards and French policemen on rollerblades. In the end they moved the flame onto a bus. 
San Francisco responded by announcing a route that turned out to be a decoy. Protesters gathered on one side of town while the torch was rushed by bus to the other. For a few blocks the torchbearers ran, amid police three lines deep, along a mostly empty thoroughfare until protesters caught up with the parade. At that point the torch disappeared into another bus and left for the airport.
Protesters everywhere have demanded that China talk to the Dalai Lama, or just get ""out, out, out"" of Tibet. The torch itself has become an issue--in particular the plan to parade it through Tibet in June. But China has shown no sign of wavering on either the international or domestic parts of the itinerary. At a meeting in Beijing of the International Olympic Committee, Liu Jingmin, of China's games-organising team, said he was confident the international component could be completed. 
The Chinese press has portrayed the disruptions as marginal, amid massive shows of support by ordinary citizens. State television aired a brief comment by Paula Radcliffe, a British marathon runner, endorsing the importance of the protesters' cause while condemning their methods. The Chinese subtitle, however, removed the endorsement. 
The Chinese press have called the thugs in blue and white ""valiant and heroic"". It has reported that the squad is made up of officers from the paramilitary People's Armed Police, who have been training for this role since last August, including learning to give orders in five languages. 
The relay is still due to visit a dozen other countries, including India, home to the Dalai Lama and the government-in-exile. With each protest, the pressure mounts on Western leaders not to attend the opening ceremony for the games in August. This week, France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, spelled out his condition for going: fresh dialogue between China and Tibet. Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, managed to say both that he was not going and that he was not boycotting (maybe he had recalled an important EU meeting). Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the Democratic contenders for the American presidency, said George Bush should stay away. Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, talked in a speech in Beijing of ""significant human-rights problems"" in Tibet. 
Just as damaging for China in the long run, however, may be the effect on ordinary citizens. One place the Tibetan flag no longer flies is in the window of a bed shop in the English city of Sheffield. Its owner is a Tibetan sympathiser, who displayed the flag last month. Two young Chinese, apparently students, visited and made threats. That night his windows were smashed.

TRY hailing a taxi or ordering a meal in a restaurant in Perth these days and you may be in for a long wait. The capital of Western Australia (WA) is suffering a labour shortage, as young people head north to make real money from a mining boom. China's insatiable demand for WA's minerals is driving it, and helping China displace Japan as Australia's biggest trading partner. But Australia has also to balance its mining windfalls against clashes with China over human rights.
The Pilbara, a desert region about 1,300km (800 miles) north of Perth, is the main focus. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, two of the world's biggest resource companies, roughly share the Pilbara's iron-ore deposits that feed China's flourishing steel industry. China takes about half their exports. They can barely dig it out fast enough to meet demand.
Rio Tinto plans to double its 2007 iron-ore production (160m tonnes) in four years. Last year iron ore earned the company $8.8 billion, mostly from the Pilbara. The region is rich in more than minerals. Archaeologists have reportedly found ancient aboriginal tools at Hope Downs. Rio Tinto jointly controls this iron-ore mine with Gina Rinehart, daughter of the late Lang Hancock, a pioneer Pilbara tycoon. 
The West is Australia's largest state, with just one-tenth of the country's population. Thanks to the mining boom, it now underwrites much of the country's economic growth. Last year the state's economy grew by 6.3%, almost double the national rate. Eric Ripper, WA' s treasurer (finance minister), says his state ""struggled"" to post an A$9m ($8.3m) surplus seven years ago, before China's boom took off; the surplus last year was A$2 billion.
The ""wild west"", as WA is sometimes known, has seen other booms end in tears. Alan Birchmore, a veteran of some, and on the board of United Minerals, a company with a Pilbara iron-ore lease, reckons this one is different: it has ""depth"". ""China"", he says, ""is showing that it takes some stopping once people get a taste for consumption."" Some forecasts back him up. In a report for Rio Tinto and the Australian National University, Ross Garnaut and Ligang Song, two economists, argue that by 2020 China's demand for metals may increase by the equivalent of the industrial world's annual total demand now.
Meanwhile, the Pilbara's miners are wrangling with their biggest customer. After three years of successive price rises, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are reported to be seeking a 70% increase in contract prices this year. Chinese buyers are unhappy that both companies have made a killing selling some iron ore on the spot market; they are demanding that more be sold under lower-priced, long-term contracts. The Australian companies believe they have an advantage: their costs of shipping iron ore to China are about one-third those of Brazil, their main competitor.
Rather than jeopardise a huge trading relationship, Australian governments have tended to tread softly in their dealings with China over human rights. After nearly five months as Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd was less constrained in a speech in Beijing on April 9th, referring to problems in Tibet. And he has banned Chinese security guards from accompanying the Olympic torch on its scheduled run through Canberra on April 24th.
China's bottomless need for Australia's resources is likely to override any political offence it may take from this. The boom's conflicts are closer to home. Mr Ripper says 500 people are arriving in WA each week to fill jobs for a bonanza whose scale took everyone by surprise. Rio Tinto's answer is a plan to move ore from mines to ports on a fleet of driverless trucks and trains, starting in 2010. But jobs will not disappear completely. People in Perth will give the ""intelligent"" vehicles their instructions by remote control.","The global reach of China 's boom

FOR all the boundless energy he has shown since becoming Australia's prime minister five months ago, Kevin Rudd looked tired on April 20th, as he received a document listing ideas for the country's future. And little wonder. Mr Rudd has staked a claim to represent the ""reforming centre"" of Australian politics. Yet even someone with his self-assurance must have been daunted by the document's main big idea: wholesale reform of Australia's 107-year-old constitution.
The document was the product of an ""ideas summit"" that Mr Rudd had assembled in Canberra. Its 1,000 participants, invited by his government or chosen by it from applicants, included business leaders, celebrities, politicians, sex workers, outback farmers and aboriginal Australians. They argued for two days over how they wanted Australia to change by 2020.
For all its novelty value, and despite a few dismissive sceptics, the gathering was perfectly timed by a prime minister who is riding a wave of public approval. Since he unseated the former conservative coalition of John Howard last November, leading Labor to power after almost 12 years in opposition, Mr Rudd has embarked on change at a relentless pace. First he ratified the Kyoto protocol on climate change; then he delivered a formal apology in Parliament to the ""stolen generations"" of aborigines for past injustices.
Within hours of returning from a 17-day trip to America, Europe and China on April 13th, he announced the appointment of Quentin Bryce, a human-rights lawyer, as Australia's first female governor-general (representing Queen Elizabeth, Australia's head of state). The main opposition Liberal Party is still stunned from its election rout. An opinion poll after the summit suggested Mr Rudd's honeymoon has a long way to run: 71% of voters preferred him as prime minister, compared with 10% for Brendan Nelson, the opposition leader. 
Mr Nelson's party had banished grand gestures from Australia's political agenda. But Mr Rudd, in his embrace of change, admires them: witness the summit itself. He opened it in the great hall of Parliament House by declaring that the ""old way of governing has long been creaking and groaning."" Participants then divided into ten groups to devise better ideas.
Some groups wanted Australia to become more green. Others wanted it more connected with Asia, and to take a stronger role in combating HIV and other epidemics in the Pacific. One issue, however, swept all others aside: reform of Australia's constitution, enacted in 1901 to divide power between the federal government and the six states.
David Morgan, a former boss of Westpac, one of Australia's biggest banks, says the original model is ""poorly suited to the needs of the 21st century"". The most urgent task, he says, is the creation of a national economy unhampered by conflicting state-government regulations. George Williams, a constitutional lawyer, blames the ""dysfunctional"" constitution for some A$9 billion ($8.5 billion) a year lost in buck-passing, red tape and duplication. Heather Ridout, of the Australian Industry Group, a business lobby, argues the federal structure is the most glaring cause of policy failures in health and education.
After a standing ovation for Mr Rudd, the most rousing applause came for a call to end Australia's constitutional links with the monarchy and make it a republic. Mr Rudd responded: ""This federation needs to be fixed."" He will reply to the summit's ideas later this year. But writing the states and the queen out of the constitutional picture is easier said than done. Of 44 referendum proposals over the years to change the constitution, only eight have passed. A referendum on becoming a republic in 1999 failed, largely out of popular cynicism about the motives of the politicians promoting the reform.
With his people's summit, Mr Rudd's bid for a fresh start has at least cleverly tapped a growing sense among Australians that politicians and civil servants do not have all the answers. Bill Bowtell of the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think-tank, argues that the summit was a ""breathtaking"" exercise in winning endorsement for reform. For now, Mr Rudd's government faces the more mundane task of delivering its first budget in May. After figures on April 23rd showed annual inflation at 4.2%, spending cuts are unavoidable. The budget, more than the summit, may decide if Mr Rudd's honeymoon continues.

An opinion poll after the summit suggested Kevin Rudd's honeymoon has a long way to run : 71 % of voters preferred Kevin Rudd as prime minister , compared with 10 % for Brendan Nelson , the opposition leader . 
 Mr Nelson 's party had banished grand gestures from Australia 's political agenda . But Kevin Rudd , in Kevin Rudd's embrace of change , admires them : witness the summit itself . Kevin Rudd opened it in the great hall of Parliament House by declaring that the "" old way of governing has long been creaking and groaning . "" Participants then divided into ten groups to devise better ideas . 
 Some groups wanted Australia to become more green . Others wanted it more connected with Asia , and to take a stronger role in combating HIV and other epidemics in the Pacific . One issue , however , swept all others aside : reform of Australia 's constitution , enacted in 1901 to divide power between the federal government and the six states . 
 David Morgan , a former boss of Westpac , one of Australia 's biggest banks , says the original model is "" poorly suited to the needs of the 21st century "" . The most urgent task , he says , is the creation of a national economy unhampered by conflicting state - government regulations . George Williams , a constitutional lawyer , blames the "" dysfunctional "" constitution for some A$ 9 billion ( $ 8.5 billion ) a year lost in buck - passing , red tape and duplication . Heather Ridout , of the Australian Industry Group , a business lobby , argues the federal structure is the most glaring cause of policy failures in health and education . 
 After a standing ovation for Kevin Rudd , the most rousing applause came for a call to end Australia 's constitutional links with the monarchy and make it a republic . Kevin Rudd responded : "" This federation needs to be fixed . "" Kevin Rudd will reply to the summit 's ideas later this year . But writing the states and the queen out of the constitutional picture is easier said than done . Of 44 referendum proposals over the years to change the constitution , only eight have passed . A referendum on becoming a republic in 1999 failed , largely out of popular cynicism about the motives of the politicians promoting the reform . 
 With Kevin Rudd's people 's summit , Kevin Rudd's bid for a fresh start has at least cleverly tapped a growing sense among Australians that politicians and civil servants do not have all the answers . Bill Bowtell of the Lowy Institute , a Sydney think - tank , argues that the summit was a "" breathtaking "" exercise in winning endorsement for reform . For now , Kevin Rudd's government faces the more mundane task of delivering its first budget in May. After figures on April 23rd showed annual inflation at 4.2 % , spending cuts are unavoidable . The budget , more than the summit , may decide if Kevin Rudd's honeymoon continues .

IF COUNTRIES were traded like books, Nauru, one of the world's smallest, would long ago have ended up on the remaindered shelf. The tiny remote speck in the Pacific is an economic shipwreck. Since last August, when an election left parliament deadlocked, it has also suffered utter political paralysis. A snap election called for April 26th by the president, Marcus Stephen, may at least produce a government capable of making decisions. But it will not provide a solution to the country's biggest economic headache: the collapse of its most recent business venture--acting as an immigration holding-pen for Australia.
Among the many changes wrought by Kevin Rudd (see previous article) was the closure last month of the detention centres on Nauru for people seeking asylum in Australia. The centres dated from 2001, when John Howard, prime minister of the then ruling conservative coalition, offered the cash-strapped islanders financial grants, debt write-offs and free fuel in return for building them and keeping the asylum seekers far from Australian soil while their applications were processed. So delighted were the islanders with the windfall that the first would-be refugees were greeted with songs and flowers. The centres became a lifeline for the island's 13,000 people, employing about one-tenth of them directly. 
Their closure follows a string of commercial mishaps for an island that was, improbably (and briefly), among the world's richest places in terms of income per head in the 1970s. Its bounty was the lucrative product of millennia of seagull-droppings on coral: phosphates, for fertiliser.
As the money rolled in many islanders chose to remain unemployed, cashing the royalty cheques while foreign workers dug out the deposits. Nauruans literally grew fat on their earnings; rates of obesity and diabetes soared. But strip mining has left the island a barren, jagged wasteland. The wealth it generated was squandered in a number of disastrous investments, as Nauru tried its hand as an early sovereign-wealth fund, and got its fingers burnt. It tried to reinvent itself as an offshore tax haven, and took to hosting all manner of shady banking nameplates. Its services were reputedly much in demand among the Russian mafia. And it made friends with Taiwan, a generous donor to its dwindling band of diplomatic partners.
The abrupt end to the detention-centre business may throw Nauru again on the mercy of international donors. It will help if the election produces a functioning government. The lack of a government majority in the 18-seat parliament has stalled investment projects and the passage of a budget. The election was prompted by a row between Mr Stephen and the parliament's speaker, David Adeang, who last month sought to bar from office two cabinet members who hold dual Australian and Nauruan citizenship. The Supreme Court ruled against the ban. But Mr Stephen decided enough was enough. Many Nauruans would agree.

STREWTH! It is almost 25 years since Paul Hogan, an Australian comedian, tried to lure tourists down under with his promise to throw ""another shrimp on the barbie"". A blend of beaches, bikini-clad women and bawdy humour made the ""Come and Say G'Day"" campaign a sizzling success. In just three months Australia leapt into America's top ten ""most desired"" holiday-destination list, having previously failed to make the top 50. The number of visitors doubled in four years.
Ever since, Tourism Australia, the government outfit charged with pulling in tourists, has faced the irksome task of escaping from Mr Hogan's larger-than-life shadow. Its most recent campaign, launched two years ago, also combined cheeky humour with curvaceous bodies--the ad concludes with Lara Bingle, an Australian model, asking prospective tourists: ""So Where the Bloody Hell Are You?"" This was judged too foul-mouthed for Britain, where the advertisement was initially banned. Meanwhile, the Japanese version, ""So Why Aren't You Coming?"" sounded lacklustre and became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Last year the number of Japanese visitors fell by 12%.
Even though the most recent figures show that tourists poured A$85 billion ($71 billion) into the economy in 2007, the most since 1999, growth has been sluggish--from 4.9m visitors in 2000 to 5.6m last year. Australia remains popular with business travellers and backpackers, but the bottom has fallen out of the ""mums and dads"" market, the people who had been drawn in by Mr Hogan's larrikin charm.
Privately, the new government under Kevin Rudd, who became prime minister in November, would probably utter a few expletives of its own to describe the ""So Where the Bloody Hell Are You?"" campaign. Publicly, it has ordered a rethink. The tourism minister, Martin Ferguson, says he wants to promote Australia as a ""mature, inviting country"", seemingly in a bid to escape the stereotypes and cliches.
Tourism Australia is now in the final stages of awarding one of the most lucrative accounts in Antipodean advertising: the three-year contract for its new global marketing campaign. The winner is due to be announced in June. ""The Hogan ad was brilliant,"" says Geoff Buckley, the managing director of Tourism Australia. ""But it was never taken globally. Nowadays we need a unique and motivating message that resonates in 23 different markets.""
For all Australia's photogenic beauty and charm, this is a tall order. The country's remoteness means that it is beyond the reach of most low-cost airlines, which have fuelled tourism in Europe and Asia. The strength of the Australian dollar has made it more expensive for visitors. In the longer term, tourism chiefs are worried about climate change. Global warming not only threatens some of its most spectacular tourist destinations, such as the Great Barrier Reef, but may make long-haul travel environmentally incorrect.
Christopher Brown of TTF Australia, an industry lobby group, wants the government to form a brand council, bringing together representatives not just from the travel world, but from the wine, food, film and fashion industries too. ""We need some heavy-lifting from other sectors to add depth and richness to the Australian story,"" he says. ""No country can afford to sell itself with a 30-second tourism ad.""
Inspiration might come from across the Tasman Sea, where the ""100% Pure New Zealand"" campaign has successfully targeted adventure-seeking tourists. Its dreamy advertisements combine the ""Lord of the Rings"" landscape, Maori culture and rugby in a way that is stirring rather than stereotypical. But sophistication is no guarantee of success.

WHEN he led the Labor Party to victory in November, Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, boasted that he was a fiscal conservative. So when his government presented its first budget on May 13th, everyone wanted to see if he would remain true to that claim or to his other election promises to splurge cash on education, transport, health and the environment. In the event, Mr Rudd managed to do a bit of both.
Wayne Swan, the Treasurer (finance minister), announced a budget surplus for 2008-09 of almost A$22 billion ($21 billion). At 1.8% of GDP, it is the largest such surplus in almost a decade. Much of this bounty is the result of Australia's booming minerals trade with China. The Treasury calculates that soaring coal and iron-ore prices have improved Australia's terms of trade by 40% since 2004; by the end of this year, it says, the improvement will be around 70%. The resulting windfall surpasses even the bonanza of the 1950s, when Australia got rich from soaring wool sales during and after the Korean war. 
But the latest boom has proved a curse as well as a blessing. It has helped drive inflation to more than 4% over the past year. In a bid to rein in the price rises, Australia's central bank has raised interest rates eight times in the past three years. On May 9th the bank gave warning that ever-improving terms of trade were putting more upward pressure on prices.
Mr Swan therefore had to make Labor's first budget in 13 years one that both tamed inflation and boosted the market's confidence in the new government. By one measure, at least, he succeeded. Rather than spend the latest surplus now, the government plans to park it, together with next year's forecast surplus (for a total of A$41 billion), in three funds earmarked for upgrading infrastructure, education and health. The idea is to roll out the invested money later, when inflation pressures have eased (and perhaps closer to the next election, due in 2010). The hope is also to avoid the criticism now raining down on the former conservative government that it squandered its windfall gains on tax cuts and other goodies. Stephen Antony, a former Treasure official, says the Howard government behaved like ""drunken sailors"".
The budget predicts growth will slow next year and that inflation will drop slightly from 4% to 3.25%. But this is still higher than the central bank considers acceptable. Chris Richardson of Access Economics, a Canberra consultancy, worries about a ""torrent of money"" hitting Australia from fresh minerals deals with China. Mr Swan blames inflation and higher interest rates for unemployment, which is expected to increase to 4.75% next year. Yet the budget also assumes there will be an intake of almost 200,000 immigrants in the year; a record 133,500 will be chosen to meet employers' demands for more skilled people than they can find at home. 
Mr Rudd claims the budget lays the foundation for the ""greatest modernisation of the Australian economy in a long time"". For suburban Australians, heavily in debt from borrowing and spending their way through the good times, the real test will be its impact on inflation. The answer to that is still some months away.","Kevin Rudd tries to be a prudent big spender

LAST time Australia's airlines turned to other countries to recruit large numbers of pilots, the year was 1989 and they were trying to break an unprecedented strike by their own pilots. But when Jetstar, a low-cost carrier, revealed recently that it was planning to hire more than 75 pilots from Britain, America and South Africa, it was seeking a solution to a problem facing many employers across the country: a severe shortage of skilled labour.
With an economy in its 17th year of uninterrupted growth, Australia's skills shortage has never been worse. People are crying out for plumbers, doctors and nurses. In states that are booming thanks to a mining bonanza--Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia--engineers, surveyors and truck drivers are in short supply. One state-owned water authority complains that it is losing truckers to mining companies offering A$100,000 ($96,000) a year--more than double their previous salary.
In many rich countries where immigration is a politically sensitive matter--America, Britain and Ireland--the number of immigrants seems to be falling as the economy turns down. Not in Australia. The Labor government, under Kevin Rudd, is looking to increase the numbers of foreigners allowed to settle. His predecessor, John Howard, the former conservative leader, had already begun to increase the number, but had to pretend otherwise, since his party claimed to put ""Australia first"". Mr Rudd is playing up the increases. On May 13th his government said that Australia would take 190,300 immigrants next year, a rise of 25% on this year. The biggest jump comes in the proportion of those chosen for their skills in a booming economy: at 133,500 they now account for a record 70% of the total intake.
These so-called ""permanent"" settlers tell only part of the story. With another 100,000 arrivals expected under a short-term visa scheme that allows employers to fill urgent job vacancies from outside Australia, the total intake is likely to be closer to 300,000. Other changes will make still more foreigners available for work. The government is abolishing a restriction enforced by the Howard government that meant illegal immigrants later found to be refugees could get only temporary permission to stay in Australia. And it is thinking about letting in guest workers from Pacific Island nations--a measure used successfully in New Zealand and which Mr Howard sternly opposed.
The latest annual figures are the highest since Australia launched an immigration programme soon after the second world war. They also signal something of a revolution in the way Australia tackles this politically charged issue. Originally, immigration was a way to populate a big, empty country with ""ten-pound Poms"", Britons who paid just pounds 10 (then $27) to start a new life down under. 
That approach, says Chris Evans, the immigration minister, was designed for a world in which people did not move much. Today, he argues, the country needs a policy fit for a world in which people move often for work. He points out that 500,000 people with ""work rights"" entered Australia last year: students and holiday-makers, as well as those on work visas. And the country still suffers skilledlabour bottlenecks.
Australia is in some respects paying a price for failing to invest in skills and infrastructure to meet the demands of what the Treasury calls a ""once-in-50-years boom"". Not long ago, the sight of a Labor government bowing to demands from bosses and opening the gates to foreign workers would have produced howls of anguish from unions. Not now. With unemployment at a 30-year low, falling union membership and an ageing domestic workforce, the Rudd government can afford to be bold about using immigration as a tool of economic management. Mr Evans says that from now on immigration will play a bigger role in the ""structure of Australia's workforce"".

Barack Obama secured the support of enough superdelegates to claim victory in the Democratic primaries, making him almost certain to become the first black presidential nominee of a big American party. At a rally Mr Obama described his candidacy as an ""historic journey"". He also praised his opponent in the primaries, Hillary Clinton. She stopped short of conceding defeat, but plans an event to show party unity. 
On the last day of voting in the primaries, Mr Obama won Montana, as expected, but lost South Dakota to Mrs Clinton, which was a surprise. She earlier won Puerto Rico by a wide margin. 
John McCain reiterated his challenge to his opponent in the general election to take part in a series of ten joint town-hall meetings, which they would fly to in the same aircraft in order ""to embrace the politics of civility"". 
Mr McCain and Mr Obama made separate speeches at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group. Mr Obama promised to do ""everything"" to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. 
Antoin Rezko, a former fund-raiser for Mr Obama, was found guilty of fraud and money-laundering by a court in Chicago. In a statement, Mr Obama said, ""This isn't the Tony Rezko I knew."" Separately, Mr Obama severed his 20-year ties with a controversial church in Chicago after the emergence of yet another racially charged sermon there. 
In California, a judge ruled that the state's first same-sex marriages could proceed, but a voters' initiative that would overturn their legality qualified for November's ballot.

Trying to tackle a world crisis
At a United Nations food summit in Rome, the UN's secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said food output would have to rise by 50% by 2030; the World Food Programme said it would distribute $1.2 billion more in food aid; and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the West for increases in food prices. The presence of Mr Mugabe was widely condemned. A third of Zimbabweans need food aid because of the country's disastrous land-reform policies.
Arthur Mutambara, a senior opposition figure in Zimbabawe, was arrested, and later released, for criticising Mr Mugabe in a newspaper. Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the main opposition party, was briefly detained while campaigning in the presidential run-off, due on June 27th. 
American forces recorded their lowest military death toll in Iraq since the invasion of the country in 2003; 19 were killed in May. But in the biggest such attack for months, at least 15 people were killed by a bomb in Baghdad. Meanwhile, Australia began withdrawing its 550-strong troop contingent from the allied coalition, fulfilling a pledge made by the prime minister, Kevin Rudd.
The remains of five Israeli soldiers killed in the 2006 war with the Lebanese-based Islamic Hizbullah were returned by the group to Israel. This came after the Israelis released a Lebanese-born man accused of spying for Hizbullah. Israel denied that there had been any deal.

Barack Obama secured the support of enough superdelegates to claim victory in the Democratic primaries, making him almost certain to become the first black presidential nominee of a big American party. At a rally Mr Obama described his candidacy as an ""historic journey"". He also praised his opponent in the primaries, Hillary Clinton. She stopped short of conceding defeat, but plans an event to show party unity. 
On the last day of voting in the primaries, Mr Obama won Montana, as expected, but lost South Dakota to Mrs Clinton, which was a surprise. She earlier won Puerto Rico by a wide margin. 
John McCain reiterated his challenge to his opponent in the general election to take part in a series of ten joint town-hall meetings, which they would fly to in the same aircraft in order ""to embrace the politics of civility"". 
Mr McCain and Mr Obama made separate speeches at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group. Mr Obama promised to do ""everything"" to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. 
Antoin Rezko, a former fund-raiser for Mr Obama, was found guilty of fraud and money-laundering by a court in Chicago. In a statement, Mr Obama said, ""This isn't the Tony Rezko I knew."" Separately, Mr Obama severed his 20-year ties with a controversial church in Chicago after the emergence of yet another racially charged sermon there.

FEW would dispute that Canada's shameful treatment of many of its aboriginals has left a stain on its image. Between 1870 and 1996, an estimated 150,000 indigenous children were wrenched from their homes and sent to Christian boarding schools, where many were sexually and physically abused. Yet until Stephen Harper, Canada's Conservative prime minister, rose in the House of Commons on June 11th to deliver an unqualified official apology to assembled leaders of Canada's 1m First Nation, Inuit and mixed-race Metis people, no Canadian leader had taken this step.
Parallels will be drawn with a similar act of contrition by Kevin Rudd, Australia's Labor prime minister in February. But the two differ in important respects. Australia offered an apology, but no compensation, to 55,000 mixed-race children forced into white foster homes. Mr Harper's apology follows a C$2 billion ($2 billion) settlement in 2005 of a lawsuit by former students of schools set up, in Mr Harper's words, ""to kill the Indian in the child"" by assimilating them into the dominant culture.
Mr Harper's decision to apologise now is probably aimed in part at curtailing future lawsuits by Indian victims of abuse, who chose not to take part in the earlier settlement. But it is also shows that he understands the value of saying sorry when the state has harmed its citizens. He recently apologised to Maher Arar, a Canadian tortured in Syria after wrongly being identified as a terrorist; and to Chinese-Canadians for the government's punitive Chinese head-tax policy of 1885-1923.
But this week's ceremony is also testimony to the increasingly sophisticated use made by Canada's indigenous tribes, who make up a mere 3.8% of the population, of the courts, alliances with environmental groups and targeted protests against mining companies to strengthen their otherwise limited influence.
This communications savvy was on display in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, on May 29th, when the premiers of the four, resource-rich western provinces decided to interrupt their annual summit to participate in a ""national day of action"" called by the First Nations, many in traditional feathered head-dress. Intended as a ""we-share-your-pain"" gesture beloved by politicians, it backfired when Chief Albert Mercredi took advantage of the assembled media to denounce the premiers for allowing mining development to pollute the aboriginals' air, land and water. The chief, whose own band lives on Lake Athabasca, downstream and downwind from massive tar-sands operations in Alberta, says the recent arrival of the internet in isolated communities allows them to keep track of the outside world's ideas and deeds. 
Informal alliances with environmental groups, adept at using the media to generate political pressure, give aboriginal groups allies in the land-use disputes they once fought on their own. Their ends may differ--greens seized on the oily death of 500 ducks in an Alberta tailing pond last April to promote wildlife safeguards, while the native group downstream regarded the threat to human health as the salient point--but they help each other generate publicity. Tensions do arise, however. Whereas green groups tend to oppose any development, aboriginals are keen on job creation--so long as they are consulted about sustainable projects.
High mineral prices offer native Canadians living in the remote areas where most such resources are found another way to raise their profile. A well-targeted protest that raises corporate hackles--such as the one over a proposed platinum mine in northern Ontario that led to the arrest and imprisonment of six members of the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug band--can produce a quicker political response than years of patient negotiations. Ontario's premier now says he will change mining law to ensure that aboriginals are consulted in advance of any mining on their land. Across Canada, other groups are using similar tactics against a wide array of pipeline and mining projects, confident that pressure from frustrated companies will force politicians to take notice.
Although native Canadians may be speaking more loudly, they do not yet do so with one voice. No single group represents them all, which is one reason why there are no co-ordinated proposals to improve aboriginal living conditions, education and financial prospects, which still trail national averages by a wide margin. Still, with the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 providing a golden opportunity for protest, the First Nations, Inuit and Metis have time to hone their already sharp skills in getting out their message.

MORE and more luckless people are seeking safety and a better future in whatever country they can find; and in various ways, many of the rich countries which might be able to help them are hardening their hearts, often under electoral pressure. That seems to be the common theme of many recent news reports about forced migration.
After a welcome decline between 2001 and 2005, the number of refugees--in the classic sense of people forced to leave their countries because of war or persecution--rose in 2007 for the second straight year, mainly because of turmoil in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United Nations reported this week. As of last December there were 11.4m people under the care of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, up from 9.9m a year earlier. Then there are people uprooted within their own countries: the December 2007 total was 26m, a year-on-year increase of 1.6m. Countries with high numbers of internally displaced include Colombia (3m), Iraq (2.4m). Uganda (1.2m) and Somalia (1m). And if you throw the net really wide, to include people forced to move by natural disasters, the number of uprooted people reached 67m last year, the UNHCR says. Its secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, has predicted that the interlocking problems of climate change, food shortage and state failure could well make the problem worse before long. 
Only a fraction of the people on the move actually invoke the UNHCR procedure under which somebody who faces persecution at home can demand asylum in another country. But that figure also ticked upwards (by 5% to 647,200) in 2007, the first rise for four years. In the European Union, the number of bids for asylum rose by 10.9% last year after several years of decline. Against this dire background, people who lobby for refugees' rights were dismayed by the European Parliament's passage on June 18th of a long-debated ""returns directive"" which sets the conditions under which illegal migrants can be detained, and eventually sent home.
Under the directive, people who enter the European Union illegally can be detained for at least six months, plus a further year if they ""fail to co-operate"" with the authorities. (Existing limits vary from 32 days in France to 20 months in Latvia; eight countries declare no limits.) They should be kept in purpose-built detention centres, except in cases of ""unforeseen heavy burdens"", in which case ordinary jails will do. Anybody who is expelled from an EU country may not re-enter for five years. Defenders of the directive say it will raise standards in some places and allow detention only when necessary. 
In theory, none of these measures has anything to do with bona fide fugitives from persecution; the new rules are aimed at illegal entrants with no claim to asylum, or at those who seek asylum and are rejected. But UNHCR officials, and migrants' lobbies, are still unhappy. They argue that asylum-seekers are often lumped together with illegal entrants, and that refugees get little chance to stake their claim. 
It is true that the fate of asylum-seekers varies from one EU country to another. It seems that an Iraqi stands a better-than-even chance of being granted asylum in Germany, but virtually no chance in Greece. Two-thirds of the Chechens who sought asylum in Austria were successful, while no Chechen has found shelter in Slovakia. Those figures were cited by EU officials this week as they laid out a plan for a common asylum policy that would deal consistently with people at Europe's gate.
Does all this entitle other rich countries--sometimes exasperated by Europe's image as the home of compassionate capitalism--to give the EU a scolding for its treatment of the world's unfortunates?
Canada is often thought to have set a gold standard for the treatment of asylum-seekers. It gives them ample legal protection, and detains them only briefly and rarely. But refugee groups have criticised Canada recently over an agreement it has made with the United States to co-operate on asylum cases. This lays down that a refugee making his way from America to Canada be returned across the border for processing, on the principle that America is a safe asylum destination. That agreement was struck down by a Canadian court in November 2007, and is awaiting a review by Canada's Supreme Court.
Does the United States have any reason for self-reproach over asylum-seekers? It is certainly a very popular destination, attracting 50,700 applications last year, more than any other country. And in contrast with some parts of Europe, the word ""asylum-seeker"" (which in certain British contexts is a term of abuse) has no particular negative connotations in America. Plenty of Americans fret about labour migration, but the issue of asylum is lower on the public's radar screen than in Europe.
More's the pity, say some Americans who work with refugees. There are some genuine fugitives who find themselves in jail, often for long stretches--or else returned to their home countries with little consideration of their claims. One reason for this, say refugee advocates, is that people who flee from war zones--where local warlords extort ""taxes"" from the whole population--can find themselves branded as sympathisers with terrorism.
Maybe all rich democracies should look at the recent history of Australia, where attitudes (public and private) to refugees have lately swung from harshness to a softer approach. For the previous government headed by John Howard, a tough stance towards migrants was a political trademark. In 2001, after boatloads of mainly Middle Eastern fugitives started landing in western Australia, the government sent troops to board the Tampa, a cargo vessel that had rescued about 400 desperate people from their own sinking boat. Mr Howard's insistence that none of them would get to Australia was popular at home, but it marred the country's international reputation.
Over time, though, media reports about the conditions in which would-be immigrants were being kept in offshore detention centres, or in the Australian outback, had an effect on public opinion. Since Kevin Rudd, a centre-leftist, succeeded Mr Howard as prime minister last November, policy has changed. Two nasty detention centres on islands have been shut, and it has been made easier for asylum-seekers to graduate to residency and citizenship. The public seems, on balance, to approve--though full employment and a thriving economy, thanks to the world commodity boom, probably help.

KEVIN RUDD, Australia's prime minister, wants to make Australia the ""most Asia-literate country in the collective West"". But many countries in Asia think Asia-literacy incompatible with membership of ""the West"". As hard as Australia tries to engage with the region next door, they still see it as an outsider preaching Western values to neighbours it does not fully understand. Now Mr Rudd has come up with two grand plans--for a political community and a nuclear non-proliferation body--that may throw this clash into even starker relief.
Since he led the centre-left Labor Party to power last November, Mr Rudd has clocked up some impressive foreign-policy achievements. He has withdrawn Australia's 500 combat troops from Iraq without damaging the country's alliance with America. On a visit to China in April he managed to raise concerns about Tibet in fairly blunt terms, and yet to leave relations apparently unscathed. And he seems to have soothed fears in Tokyo, for the time being at least, that he had grown too enamoured of China at Japan's expense. 
The smooth ride is now striking a few bumps. Just before he left for a visit to Japan in early June, Mr Rudd proposed the formation of a new regional body. He described it as an ""Asia-Pacific Community"" that would include America, China, Japan, India, Indonesia ""and the other states of the region"", and focus mainly on security. But it remains unclear precisely what Mr Rudd has in mind, and which countries are included in his vision. Meanwhile he has dispatched Richard Woolcott, a veteran Australian diplomat, to take soundings about what he calls ""this unfinished regional business"".
Five days later in Kyoto, Mr Rudd declared that Australia would set up an international commission on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. This body would report to a conference of nuclear experts Australia will convene in 2009, ahead of a review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty due in 2010. Gareth Evans, a former Australian foreign minister, and head of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, will co-chair the commission. Mr Rudd wants a Japanese to join him.
Initial responses to Mr Rudd's plans from Japan and others in the region have been guarded. Some welcome his idea to bring China, India and Japan into one grouping with America. But his suggestion that the new body model itself on the birth of the European Union has aroused suspicions. Since no one is contemplating that degree of regional integration, critics argue that this was a tactical mistake if he expects Asia to take his plan seriously. Moreover, in his bid to redesign the region's architecture, Mr Rudd has left unclear the future of bodies, such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations and the East Asia Summit, that Asians have founded themselves. He suggests they may become ""building blocks"" for his more expansive Asia-Pacific Community. Sniffy Asians will surely see that as presumptuous.
Allan Gyngell, head of the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think-tank, is sceptical of Mr Rudd's "" big union"" approach for the region. But he argues that Mr Rudd is right to look for new models: the current architecture, he says, is a ""mess"", with too many forums no longer suited to the new challenges posed by the rise of China and India. Martine Letts, a Lowy arms-control expert, gives Mr Rudd credit for drawing on earlier Australian initiatives against the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons. But she worries that his proposed nuclear commission could leave Australia biting off more than it can chew.
The thread linking Mr Rudd's plans seems to be China, a country he knows intimately. Both initiatives are partly ways of defusing regional tensions that may follow China's rapid growth as both an economic and a nuclear power. Australia last ventured into Asia's regional architecture 19 years ago when it co-founded the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, or APEC, a body that does not include India and passes only non-binding resolutions. To confound the sceptics, Mr Rudd's proposed institutions would need not just to match APEC's longevity, but to improve on its record as an ineffective talking-shop.
Caption: Rudd: teaching Asia-literacy to the young","Not yet mates with its neighbours 
 Kevin Rudd's wants to make Australia the "" most Asia - literate country in the collective West "" . But many countries in Asia think Asia - literacy incompatible with membership of "" the West "" . As hard as Australia tries to engage with the region next door , they still see it as an outsider preaching Western values to neighbours it does not fully understand . Now Kevin Rudd has come up with two grand plans -- for a political community and a nuclear non - proliferation body -- that may throw this clash into even starker relief . 
 Since Kevin Rudd led the centre - left Labor Party to power last November , Kevin Rudd has clocked up some impressive foreign - policy achievements . Kevin Rudd has withdrawn Australia 's 500 combat troops from Iraq without damaging the country 's alliance with America . On a visit to China in April Kevin Rudd managed to raise concerns about Tibet in fairly blunt terms , and yet to leave relations apparently unscathed . And Kevin Rudd seems to have soothed fears in Tokyo , for the time being at least , that Kevin Rudd had grown too enamoured of China at Japan 's expense . 
 The smooth ride is now striking a few bumps . Just before Kevin Rudd left for a visit to Japan in early June , Kevin Rudd proposed the formation of a new regional body . Kevin Rudd described it as an "" Asia - Pacific Community "" that would include America , China , Japan , India , Indonesia "" and the other states of the region "" , and focus mainly on security . But it remains unclear precisely what Kevin Rudd has in mind , and which countries are included in Kevin Rudd's vision . Meanwhile Kevin Rudd has dispatched Richard Woolcott , a veteran Australian diplomat , to take soundings about what Kevin Rudd calls "" this unfinished regional business "" . 
 Five days later in Kyoto , Kevin Rudd declared that Australia would set up an international commission on nuclear non - proliferation and disarmament . This body would report to a conference of nuclear experts Australia will convene in 2009 , ahead of a review of the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty due in 2010 . Gareth Evans , a former Australian foreign minister , and head of the International Crisis Group , a think - tank , will co - chair the commission . Kevin Rudd wants a Japanese to join Kevin Rudd . 
 Initial responses to Kevin Rudd's plans from Japan and others in the region have been guarded . Some welcome Kevin Rudd's idea to bring China , India and Japan into one grouping with America . But Kevin Rudd's suggestion that the new body model itself on the birth of the European Union has aroused suspicions . Since no one is contemplating that degree of regional integration , critics argue that this was a tactical mistake if Kevin Rudd expects Asia to take Kevin Rudd's plan seriously . Moreover , in Kevin Rudd's bid to redesign the region 's architecture , Kevin Rudd has left unclear the future of bodies , such as the Association of South - East Asian Nations and the East Asia Summit , that Asians have founded themselves . Kevin Rudd suggests they may become "" building blocks "" for Kevin Rudd's more expansive Asia - Pacific Community . Sniffy Asians will surely see that as presumptuous .

A fluent Mandarin speaker and former diplomat, he was believed capable of navigating the political impediments to a closer economic relationship.

WHEN Sue Gordon was four, in the late 1940s, the authorities took her from her aboriginal community in outback Western Australia, put her on a train to Perth and handed her over to a Christian charity home. As a mixed-race child, she grew up as one of Australia's ""stolen generations"" ordered to obliterate her aboriginal heritage. Now 64, and a childrens'-court magistrate, Ms Gordon has just finished assessing an equally controversial government takeover of aboriginal lives. And she is surprisingly impressed.
After a report in June last year revealed widespread aboriginal violence and child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory, John Howard, the former conservative prime minister, ordered police and the army to take control of 60 remote indigenous communities. Aborigines make up 29% of the federal territory's population, compared with 2% nationally. Mr Howard's measures included compulsory health checks on children, confining the spending of welfare money to food and clothes, and the suspension of the communities' rights to grant permits to visitors.
Critics at the time blasted the ""emergency intervention"", as it was called, as a draconian return to the white paternalism that aborigines had fought for generations. But after visiting more than half the 73 communities eventually involved, Ms Gordon has found good progress in cutting violence and sexual abuse: alcohol and pornography have been banned, more children are going to school and police patrols have left more women feeling safer. 
After Ms Gordon's report, Kevin Rudd, the Labor leader who succeeded Mr Howard in November, has undertaken to continue the A$900m ($864m) intervention exercise with another A$300m--but not indefinitely, as Mr Howard has planned. Since Mr Rudd's formal apology in February for past injustices, there is now pressure on aborigines to take advantage of the big-brother approach and secure self-reliant futures free from government.
Most of the Northern Territory communities stemmed from the land-rights movement of the 1970s, which allowed white Australia to absolve its guilt for kicking the original inhabitants off those lands. Government services did not follow the award of land, but alcohol, unemployment and social breakdown did. Ms Gordon is ""aghast"" at arguments that the communities should now be closed altogether and their people shipped out, just as in the bad old days. She accepts, though, that their survival can come only from developing their own economies with help from the private sector.
This is starting to happen already in resource-rich regions such as Western Australia. Andrew Forrest, whose company, Fortescue Metals, is making a fortune from that state's iron ore, has formed a trust to help mainly indigenous children. Mr Forrest told a recent forum in Kalgoorlie, a gold-mining city, that mining firms could eradicate aboriginal poverty by helping to create 250,000 jobs in the next decade. That may be optimistic. But Ms Gordon herself has set the example. She has raised almost half of the A$5m needed to buy the land where she lived in a charity home 60 years ago. She plans to build a place where she and other surviving inmates can care for each other in retirement.

COALMINERS in New South Wales (NSW), Australia's most populous state, boast that they export enough of the black stuff to supply New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore with all their electricity. Along with Queensland and Victoria, the state also digs up enough to provide Australia as a whole with 83% of its power. This dirty energy has turned Australia into one of the world's highest per person emitters of greenhouse gases. With more than 200 years' supply of black coal left, Australians have never much questioned this. But that may be about to change.
The Labor government, under Kevin Rudd, outlined plans in a green paper on July 16th to cut carbon pollution with an emissions-trading scheme. Mr Rudd's promise to tackle climate change played a large part in Labor's election win last November. During its 11 years in power the former conservative coalition, under John Howard, largely ignored the issue.
Mr Rudd ratified the Kyoto protocol soon after his victory. After this symbolic gesture, the politics may now prove harder. Under Mr Rudd's cap-and-trade scheme, Australia's biggest polluters will have to start buying permits to emit carbon in a market auction each year from 2010. The government's aim is to cut emissions by 60% of 2000 levels by 2050. 
It reckons the scheme is likely to affect only 1,000 companies, that emit more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year. Even here there will be sweeteners. Initially, businesses whose exports could suffer will receive free permits. Coal-fired power stations will get cash compensation. Revenue from permits will be used to help the poor cope with the higher carbon costs that companies pass on. And, if petrol prices rise from carbon costs, the government will for three years cut its excise tax by the same amount. Green groups accuse the government of diluting its plan to please business and avoid a political backlash.
In a report on July 4th that Mr Rudd commissioned, Ross Garnaut, an eminent economist, called for a tougher approach than the prime minister appears to be taking. Without a lower-carbon economy, Mr Garnaut said, the Great Barrier Reef and other Australian ""heartlands"" would change ""beyond recognition"".
Yet Australia's dependence on coal and other mineral exports makes the government wary. Thanks to demand from Asia, coal exports are expected to grow by one-third over the next five years. Critics accuse Australia of double standards: curbing emissions at home, yet exporting carbon fuel to less strict countries. Nikki Williams, head of the NSW Minerals Council, a lobby group, argues that the answer is to pour more money into ""clean-coal"" research: cutting emissions by capturing and storing carbon. Australia already has several such pilot schemes, but their commercial promise is still years away.
Despite their plan's gaps, Mr Rudd and Penny Wong, his climate-change minister, seem to have got the politics right, for now. An opinion poll on July 21st found more than two-thirds agreeing Australia should cut its emissions, even if other countries did not. Mr Rudd's real problems may start later this year, when a white paper will put figures on carbon caps up to 2050. Only then will business know the real costs.","Kevin Rudd loses some green points

EVER since John Howard led it to a crushing election defeat to Labor last November, Australia's conservative Liberal Party has wandered in a political wasteland. On September 16th, still clamouring for a way out, it elected Malcolm Turnbull as its new leader. In doing so, the Liberals buried the rigid policy agenda that marked Mr Howard's 11 years in power. Mr Turnbull, a reformer, offers the Liberals their best hope of loosening the grip on public approval that Kevin Rudd has won in his first months as prime minister.
The speed of Mr Turnbull's rise took even him by surprise. He returned from a holiday just as Brendan Nelson, installed after the shock of the Howard defeat, called a vote to shore up his crumbling leadership. This rather stole the limelight from Peter Costello, a former aspirant for the job, with his bitter memoir attacking Mr Howard for not handing over to him, though he declined to stand himself this time. In a two-horse race, Mr Turnbull beat Mr Nelson by four votes.
At 53, and after only four years in parliament, Mr Turnbull will be a less conventional leader than any of them. A former journalist and lawyer, he made a fortune in the 1990s as a banker with Goldman Sachs and an entrepreneur who helped launch an internet company. His constituency, facing Sydney Harbour on one side and Bondi Beach on the other, is among Australia's richest. But Mr Turnbull says he knows how it is to be short of money and to live in rented flats. His mother, a writer and academic, left for America when he was still a child. He was brought up by his father. 
Mr Turnbull has championed some policies long before his conservative party was ready for them: an emissions-trading scheme, an apology to indigenous Australians, ending discrimination against same sex couples (though not legalising gay marriage) and making Australia a republic. With the exception of the republic, the Rudd government is implementing all of these. 
Mr Turnbull's bigger challenge will be to heal the Liberals' divisions, and to restore their reputation for economic management. He shares with Mr Rudd a personal authority not beholden to party bosses, and a desire to draw his party to the centre, away from its more doctrinaire traditions. Up to a point, that is. 
Mr Rudd welcomed Mr Turnbull with a call for co-operation on a timetable for ending constitutional ties with the British monarchy. Mr Turnbull retorted this was now a lost cause as long as Queen Elizabeth reigned. Republicans bemoaned such a timid schedule, which might defer change until long after Mr Turnbull himself has left the political stage.","Unconventionally , the Liberals pick a liberal

DOES Wall Street owe the people of America an apology? That was Senator Sherrod Brown's suggestion to Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson during a Senate hearing last week. If so, the humbled titans of finance will be in good company; institutional apologies have mushroomed in past years (see table on next page). British Christians, for example, have expressed public contrition for slavery (pictured above) and have even considered apologising for scepticism about evolution. Nicolaus Mills, an American commentator, calls the fashion for saying sorry a ""global culture of apology"". That may be an overstatement: public kowtows are still rare compared with the manifold wrongs of the past. The bigger question is what, if anything, they mean. 
An individual's private apology, if sincere and well timed, may draw the sting from debilitating feelings of humiliation, guilt and vengeance. Public remorse has more impact, but may sound opportunistic: a political trick, or a showbiz stunt. (Think of former presidential candidate John Edwards's apology for infidelity, or the singer Janet Jackson's supposed contrition for a ""wardrobe malfunction"" that exposed a nipple to horrified American television viewers). 
Apologies for past wrongs by present-day institutions are trickier still. Jonathan Sumption, a London lawyer and historian, calls them ""a vulgar anachronism""--in effect, he says, ""a rebuke to the past for not being more like the present"". Trading apologies and forgiveness on behalf of dead people sounds phoney--especially when the issue is centuries old (such as Viking rape and pillage in Ireland, which Denmark's culture minister Brian Mikkelson bemoaned in 2007). Collective guilt is an odd idea even in the present (and has often been, Mr Sumption notes, the root of just the kind of massacres for which people are now apologising). Yet at a minimum, owning up to what happened in the past, and learning lessons from it, should benefit everyone.
Even if all sides do accept that an apology is needed, the wrong kind (limited, grudging or insincere) can backfire. Japan's repeated expressions of regret for wartime atrocities jar in countries such as China and South Korea. They note sourly Japan's continued public veneration of convicted war criminals. 
Successful apologies are usually a tactic of international or national politics, particularly when a new leader wants to distance himself from past mistakes (his own, or preferably other people's). Italy has just apologised to Libya and paid reparations for colonialism (in exchange for energy deals and co-operation on migration). America's ex-president Bill Clinton and Britain's former prime minister, Tony Blair, were skilled in the theatre of public contrition on issues such as slavery. South Africa's president F.W. de Klerk apologised for apartheid in 1992; Nelson Mandela then apologised for atrocities committed by the African National Congress. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission recorded individuals' suffering and gave perpetrators a chance to confess and say sorry. 
So what makes a public apology successful? Melissa Nobles, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specialises in apologology (our word), says that they can give official backing to a particular view of history, help contain political grievances peacefully and encourage public-spiritedness among alienated parts of the population. 
But apologies don't come free. They raise the vexed question of compensation: not just money, but the promise of different legal treatment, including the right to sue for redress. Canada has recompensed indigenous children removed from their homes; so has the state government of Tasmania. America and Canada have compensated ethnic Japanese citizens interned during the second world war. 
But these were tightly defined groups that could be compensated fairly cheaply. The former conservative government of John Howard in Australia long resisted a general public apology to aborigines, fearing it would encourage divisive, race-based politics (such as quotas). He proposed a ""motion of resolution"" in 1999 that did not mention the word ""apology"". It was widely judged unsatisfactory and his successor, Kevin Rudd, apologised properly this year.
Still, fear of the legal consequences of saying sorry may be overblown. Mr Rudd's apology explicitly stated that it would have no legal import; a landmark court case confirmed that previous apologies by Australian states were protected by parliamentary privilege. America's apology for slavery was a cashless one. The tip of the iceberg
For all the recent apologies, many are still outstanding. Turkey has recently thawed relations with Armenia. But the question of 1915 (genocide or just a massacre?), and what modern Turkey should say about it, is still open. Few expect anything like the contrition Germany showed to the Jews or the reparations it paid to Israel. By saying sorry to one another Israel and the Palestinians might promote peace but also raise new complications--if, for example, the Palestinians construed an Israeli ""sorry"" as endorsing the right they claim to return to former homes. Some British public figures, such as Mr Blair, have gone in for public breast-beating about colonialism. Other former empires seem indifferent. Belgium, France, Portugal, Russia and Spain may think they have got over their imperial past; their former colonies do not. Victims (and their descendants) have longer memories than perpetrators: it is easier to forget than to forgive.
And what about apologising to the millions whose jobs and savings are threatened by the financial tsunami? Hank Paulson, America's treasury secretary and a former boss of Goldman Sachs, sidestepped Senator Brown's question by saying that he shared the general outrage and that there was ""a lot of blame to go around"". True--but it will take a lot more than an apology to make amends.","Who should apologise to whom , for what and how ?

Collective guilt is an odd idea even in the present ( and has often been , Mr Sumption notes , the root of just the kind of massacres for which people are now apologising ) . Yet at a minimum , owning up to what happened in the past , and learning lessons from it , should benefit everyone . 
 Even if all sides do accept that an apology is needed , the wrong kind ( limited , grudging or insincere ) can backfire . Japan 's repeated expressions of regret for wartime atrocities jar in countries such as China and South Korea . They note sourly Japan 's continued public veneration of convicted war criminals . 
 Successful apologies are usually a tactic of international or national politics , particularly when a new leader wants to distance himself from past mistakes ( his own , or preferably other people 's ) . Italy has just apologised to Libya and paid reparations for colonialism ( in exchange for energy deals and co - operation on migration ) . America 's ex - president Bill Clinton and Britain 's former prime minister , Tony Blair , were skilled in the theatre of public contrition on issues such as slavery . South Africa 's president F.W. de Klerk apologised for apartheid in 1992 ; Nelson Mandela then apologised for atrocities committed by the African National Congress . A Truth and Reconciliation Commission recorded individuals ' suffering and gave perpetrators a chance to confess and say sorry . 
 So what makes a public apology successful ? Melissa Nobles , a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specialises in apologology ( our word ) , says that they can give official backing to a particular view of history , help contain political grievances peacefully and encourage public - spiritedness among alienated parts of the population . 
 But apologies do n't come free . They raise the vexed question of compensation : not just money , but the promise of different legal treatment , including the right to sue for redress . Canada has recompensed indigenous children removed from their homes ; so has the state government of Tasmania . America and Canada have compensated ethnic Japanese citizens interned during the second world war . 
 But these were tightly defined groups that could be compensated fairly cheaply . The former conservative government of John Howard in Australia long resisted a general public apology to aborigines , fearing it would encourage divisive , race - based politics ( such as quotas ) . He proposed a "" motion of resolution "" in 1999 that did not mention the word "" apology "" . It was widely judged unsatisfactory and Kevin Rudd's apologised properly this year . 
 Still , fear of the legal consequences of saying sorry may be overblown . Kevin Rudd's apology explicitly stated that it would have no legal import ; a landmark court case confirmed that previous apologies by Australian states were protected by parliamentary privilege . America 's apology for slavery was a cashless one . The tip of the iceberg 
 For all the recent apologies , many are still outstanding . Turkey has recently thawed relations with Armenia . But the question of 1915 ( genocide or just a massacre ? ) , and what modern Turkey should say about it , is still open . Few expect anything like the contrition Germany showed to the Jews or the reparations it paid to Israel . By saying sorry to one another Israel and the Palestinians might promote peace but also raise new complications -- if , for example , the Palestinians construed an Israeli "" sorry "" as endorsing the right they claim to return to former homes . Some British public figures , such as Mr Blair , have gone in for public breast - beating about colonialism . Other former empires seem indifferent . Belgium , France , Portugal , Russia and Spain may think they have got over their imperial past ; their former colonies do not . Victims ( and their descendants ) have longer memories than perpetrators : it is easier to forget than to forgive . 
 And what about apologising to the millions whose jobs and savings are threatened by the financial tsunami ? Hank Paulson , America 's treasury secretary and a former boss of Goldman Sachs , sidestepped Senator Brown 's question by saying that he shared the general outrage and that there was "" a lot of blame to go around "" . True -- but it will take a lot more than an apology to make amends .",900,Australia,A30-217,IN TERM,True,"his successor , Kevin Rudd ,",2,True

ASIAN stockmarkets were among the most exuberant of the celebrants who briefly rejoiced at the massive financial interventions by American and European governments. In relief that global finance seemed to have survived its near-death experience, Hong Kong's equities climbed more than 10% on October 13th. Next day, Tokyo's soared a record 14%. But as elsewhere, these rallies proved an interlude in the sharp downward lurch. On October 16th Tokyo's Nikkei index slumped 11%. Relief that catastrophe seemed to have been averted was no substitute for economic confidence. A region itself buffeted by financial crisis in 1997-98 has not forgotten that economic pain long outlasts financial-market rout.
That earlier crisis started with local worries about Thailand's widening current-account deficit and a property bubble in Bangkok. It astonished the world with the speed and extent of the contagion that spread to other Asian countries, and emerging markets elsewhere, such as Russia and Brazil. This month's panic had spread even further in Asia, shaking countries that by and large sailed through the late 1990s such as India and Australia. 
On October 14th Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, cited ""the economic equivalent of a rolling national-security crisis"" and announced that his government would guarantee all deposits in Australian banks and other savings institutions for three years. He followed this with a spending stimulus worth A$10.4 billion ($7 billion), much of it directed at people likely to spend the money rather than hoard it: first-time homebuyers, the poor and pensioners. On October 14th Hong Kong issued a blanket guarantee of all bank deposits, with the aim of preventing the kind of capital flight that wrought havoc with the territory's capital markets during the 1997-98 crisis. Its monetary authority also announced a new facility for providing capital to the territory's banks, even though they look robust enough. But it was in the countries worst affected last time--Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea--that the echoes seemed most eerie. 
In many ways, the region is far better placed to withstand the present shock. Its banks are stronger, its currency regimes less rigid, its foreign-exchange reserves bigger. On the other hand, a decade of accelerated globalisation has seen every country integrated even more closely into the world economy. None can hope to be immune from a global slowdown. The region may not face the sort of meltdown experienced at the end of the 1990s. But prospects for growth look much bleaker than they did even a fortnight ago. Exports to rich countries still matter, albeit less than they did. And so does trade finance, which lubricates Asia's trading machinery. Ships are sitting empty in big Asian ports, their cargoes piled up on the dockside because no bank will guarantee them. Despite strong balance sheets, Asian banks may need more capital if they are to make up for a shortage of Western trade credit.
Facing such worries, anger at the apparent hypocrisy of governments in America and Europe has been muted. Asian leaders have complained that they were blamed for bringing the last crisis on themselves, with their misguided exchange-rate policies, opaque financial systems, profligate spending and corrupt politics. The bail-outs by the IMF demanded fiscal austerity at a time of economic hardship. But, since international institutions offered the only financial lifeline, most Asian governments were forced to suck up IMF orthodoxies.
True to form, Mahathir Mohamad, a former Malaysian prime minister, who was among the West's harshest critics a decade ago, has not resisted gloating. On his blog, he recalls how ""the Americans"" said Asian companies should have been allowed to go under, but now Americans are preparing bail-outs and nationalisation for their own firms.
China, too, which survived the last crisis fairly unscathed thanks to capital controls and a state-run banking system, has indulged in a bit of point-scoring. Its refusal to allow a faster appreciation of the yuan has been blamed by some for helping build up the huge global financial imbalances that now seem to be unwinding so fast. From China's perspective, the meltdown vindicates the cautious pace of its liberalisation. But its officials have tried not to sound too smug. Like their counterparts elsewhere in the region, they know it is too early to declare victory. Chinese journalists say the official media have been ordered to tone down or avoid reports about the economic impact on China. As during the earlier crisis China is trying to appear helpful. On October 8th it timed its latest interest-rate cut (of 0.27 percentage points) to coincide with concerted rate-cutting by other central banks. With its massive foreign-exchange reserves, China, like Japan, the other big Asian creditor nation, has too big a financial stake in the global system to feel anything other than anxiety at the possibility of an implosion. Marking markets
So across Asia, governments have taken measures to allay disquiet (see also
). In China the stockmarket has lost two-thirds of its value since last October; the property market is wobbling and growth is slowing. These trends all predated the latest panic. But the government has had to go further to shore up confidence. It tried to revive the stockmarket by abolishing a tax on share-buying and investing in the market itself. Japan, despite the giddy plunge of the stockmarket from October 8th-10th and the bankruptcy of a middling life insurer, Yamato Life, is confident that its financial system, recapitalised at massive public expense a decade ago, is robust enough to survive the latest shocks. 
Japan's money markets have gummed up far less than those in America and Europe. Even so, at a time when its economy is almost certainly in recession, the authorities are taking few risks. Backed by $1 trillion of reserves, the Bank of Japan has promised unlimited dollar funds to the markets. And the government has announced measures to support regional banks. It has also promised not to sell its remaining shares in the country's biggest banks for the time being, and eased conditions for companies to own shares in each other as a way to support the stockmarket. 
This year South Korea's won has sunk more than any other Asian currency. The country's current account, in surplus for many years, has slid into deficit. Banks have made a high number of loans in proportion to their deposits. Households are deep in debt and so are many smaller companies (many in dollars). In a radio address on October 13th President Lee Myung-bak insisted that the banks were sound and pointed out that the currency was backed by far larger foreign reserves than it was a decade ago. He begged South Koreans to cut down on foreign spending and energy use, and to increase spending at home.
In India, the closeted banking system is not heavily exposed to the financial crisis. Its most adventurous bank--ICICI--is the only one so far to cause jitters. Long lionised for financial sophistication, the bank is now associated with Western financial sophistry. After its share price halved in a month, it had to send text messages to its depositors reassuring them that their money was safe. Statements of support from the Reserve Bank of India, India's central bank, and the rating agencies have helped restore confidence.
Indonesia's government intervened more drastically, halting share trading for three days after sharp falls in share prices and the rupiah. When the stockmarket reopened on October 13th, the government strengthened its guarantee of bank deposits to deter a run on banks. Reasons for gloom
In the less panicky mood that prevailed this week, such measures appeared to have bolstered confidence. They did little, however, to ease two longer-term worries.
The first concerns countries that are embroiled in political upheaval and which may be ill-placed to cope with the economic storms to come. The second is how severe those storms are going to be. 
Thailand, riven by conflict between the elected government and powerful protesters (
) is especially vulnerable. But Malaysia, whose prime minister says he will step down, also has its political worries. In the Philippines, the latest in a series of doomed but distracting attempts to impeach the president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, is gathering steam. 
Even if these dangers can be skirted, the region is going to experience a sharp slowdown, though perhaps only Japan and Singapore are already in recession. In China, the slowing of the economy, caused mainly by a fall in net exports, could become a serious worry in the months ahead. Most economists expect GDP growth to fall only to 8-9% next year (from 10.1% in the second quarter of this year and 12.6% a year earlier)--hardly a grinding halt. Most Chinese economists are confident that if the slowdown is sharper, the government can still spend its way out of trouble. But an article last month in a magazine published by a government think-tank warned that a severe slowdown could present China with the kind of social turbulence that ravaged Indonesia in 1998.
China's growth is increasingly important for the region. This month Australia 's Mr Rudd rang the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, to ask about projections for China's growth, and whether its strong demand for Australia's minerals was likely to continue. On getting an upbeat answer, Mr Rudd concluded that China was now ""critical for Australia's continued economic performance"". It is also the biggest trading partner for Japan and India. But, according to the Asian Development Bank, 60% of Asia's exports (not including Japan's) still go to America, the European Union and Japan. A decline of one percentage point in America's growth rate, the bank calculates, knocks 0.3 percentage points off Asia's. That may be optimistic.
To date, one constant since the 1997-98 crisis has been the absence of a co-ordinated regional response. Out of that crisis, a self-help initiative among the region's central banks known as the ""Chiang Mai initiative"" was launched. But it seems designed to fight the last war--a concerted attack on a country's currency--rather than today's wider financial malaise.
Coincidentally, Asia's leaders will be meeting counterparts from Europe in Beijing on October 24th for the biennial ""Asia-Europe"" meeting, ASEM. The Philippines' Mrs Arroyo has in vain suggested holding a crisis summit of the Asian countries on its margins. She also boasted this week of an agreement to set up a fund to buy toxic debts from banks in South-East Asia, China, South Korea and Japan. But the World Bank, the alleged source of some of the money, and the other countries involved, could not recall such an agreement. So she managed only to heighten the impression of ill-co-ordinated floundering. At least China, the host of the ASEM talk-shop, has overcome its initial reluctance to put impending financial collapse on the agenda. It seems to have realised that it would seem odd indeed if Asian leaders spent much time talking about anything else.","The world 's financial meltdown stirs uneasy memories across Asia

AFTER 17 years, Tony and Michelle McManus are preparing for their last sheep-shearing season on Toorale, a sprawling outback property near Bourke in western New South Wales (NSW). By Christmas, Toorale's 30,000 sheep, 1,200 cattle and irrigation machinery will all be sold, ending a way of life on the ranch begun by the region's European pioneers in the 1870s. Last month Australia's federal and NSW state governments bought Toorale for almost A$24m ($17m), not to run it as a farm but to take control of a commodity that now seems more precious than the food and fibre it produces: water.
The sale of Toorale is the biggest of its kind in a plan by the federal Labor government, under Kevin Rudd, to buy water entitlements from farmers in Queensland and northern NSW. The water-buyback scheme, as it is known, is a last-ditch bid to save Australia 's biggest river system, the Murray River and its main tributary, the Darling (see map). Both are suffering from the worst drought in a century, and decades of prolific farm irrigation.
Toorale's 91,000 hectares (240,000 acres) straddle plains where the Warrego, a small river draining central Queensland, meets the Darling. Samuel McCaughey, a former owner, built a magnificent homestead there in the 1880s, when everything arrived on paddle steamers from the coast 1,000km (600 miles) away. It's a crumbling ruin now. But the elaborate system of levees he devised to store water from the Warrego, and insulate the property from drought, still operates. 
Clyde Agriculture, the company for which the McManus family has managed Toorale since 1991, says the sale was prompted partly by this old system's inefficiency: in baking outback summers, in territory that supports just one sheep for every four hectares, about two metres of the stored water can be sucked into the sky each year from evaporation. The federal government plans to send back into the rivers all 14 billion litres that Toorale is entitled to extract from the Darling and Warrego each year.
Most controversy springs from the scheme's second strand: the NSW government's plan to take over Toorale's land for a national park. Bourke's residents recently rallied to protest at the loss of what some say is the region's most productive property. Drought, tougher water rules and falling wool prices have helped to cut the district's population by a quarter in just six years.
Bourke's local council reckons Toorale's business from its crop and grazing enterprises has been worth almost A$5m to the town each year. Its loss, it says, will shrink the town's economy by 10%. The council wants the state and federal governments to keep at least some animal grazing on Toorale to protect local jobs, especially among indigenous people, who comprise 30% of Bourke's population (compared with 2% for Australia as a whole). 
On a national scale, the battle between keeping Toorale's land and water in the market, or devoting them to the environment, could set a standard for changing the way outback lands are used, almost 150 years after white settlers turned sheep and cattle loose on them. Penny Wong, the federal minister for climate change and water, admits that little, if any, of Toorale' s water will reach the Murray's depleted mouth 1,000km south. But the Wentworth Group, a batch of water experts, gives her credit for trying to revive flows. It foresees an ""unfolding environmental disaster"" if water consumption in the Murray-Darling system is not cut by up to 53%.

TWO straight railway lines run through the red desert of the Pilbara region, in Western Australia, almost touching each other in places. One belongs to BHP Billiton, a big mining company, hauling iron ore in trains more than a mile long to ships bound for China and elsewhere in Asia. The other lugs ore for Fortescue Metals, a relative newcomer. China's demand for the Pilbara's minerals to feed its insatiable steel mills has been a bedrock of Australia's boom for much of this decade. With the onset of the global financial crisis, the region is now proving crucial to whether Australia can defy the fate of other rich countries and avoid a recession.
At first the portents looked good. Australia prospered through the Asian financial crisis 11 years ago. Once derided as an ""old economy"" dependent on commodities, Australia's tangible assets in fact underwrote a further stroke of luck as China's rapid growth created an unprecedented market for iron ore and coal. China is now Australia's biggest trading partner; it buys 40% of the Pilbara's iron ore. 
A few months ago, this seemed enough to protect Australia from the storms buffeting the world economy. No longer. On November 5th the federal Treasury shaved Australia's 2008-09 growth forecast from 2.75% in May's budget to 2%. It also cut by three-quarters the forecast budget surplus of almost A$22 billion ($15 billion). Some of this was the result of a A$10.4 billion stimulus package that Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, announced last month. But the Treasury also cited falling revenues linked to the global financial crisis, and a weaker outlook for growth and demand among Australia's emerging-economy customers, including China.
Five days later the central bank delivered a bleaker prognosis. It forecast annual growth falling to just 1.5%. Some economists believe even this is optimistic. Only two months ago Glenn Stevens, the bank's governor, lauded as ""the largest shock of its kind"" an improvement of almost two-thirds in Australia's terms of trade over five years. The growth has been driven largely by demand from China, and especially by record rises the mining companies negotiated earlier this year in contract prices for iron ore and coal. Now, the bank declared, the terms of trade had peaked. 
The same day as the central bank's report, Fortescue and Rio Tinto, another mining company, announced they were cutting their Pilbara iron-ore production by 10% because of China's slowing industrial output. Just as they did so, China announced a $586 billion spending plan to recharge its economy (see page
). Mr Rudd described it as ""extraordinary"" and ""very good news"" for Australia's economy, too. In early October, as the full impact of the financial crisis sunk in, Mr Rudd, having sought reassurance from Wen Jiabao, his Chinese counterpart, that China's demand for Australia's commodities would stay strong, declared China ""critical"" for Australia's economic performance. So China's stimulus this week, inspiring visions of more iron ore needed for steel to build housing and infrastructure, has brought fresh hopes that the Pilbara once again will be the lucky country's saviour.
A region slightly smaller than Spain, about 1,300km (675 miles) north of Perth, the Pilbara was first mined for iron ore in the 1960s when Japan was East Asia's emerging industrial giant. Until recently, its reserves were pretty much carved up by a comfortable duopoly of Rio Tinto and BHP, two global giants. The China-based boom has been enlivened by the arrival of a third competitor in the form of Fortescue Metals, a Perth-based company started by Andrew Forrest, a former stockbroker.
Mr Forrest's challenge to the big boys' market control, and his colourful background, have made him something of a media darling. His great-great uncle was a pioneer, explorer and Western Australia's first premier. Mr Forrest's first bid as a commodities entrepreneur, through a nickel-mining venture, ended in tears seven years ago when his then company failed to meet promised production targets.
Undeterred, he spotted a chance to make a fortune from iron ore. He noticed that, just as China's boom started gathering steam earlier this decade, Australia's share of the market was falling, and those of India and Brazil were rising. Defying market sceptics, he raised almost A$3 billion, mainly from American bondholders, to launch Fortescue. In May, barely five years after he founded the company, it shipped its first iron ore to Baosteel, China's biggest steel company. 
At that time, few people outside the business world, and his home state, had heard of Mr Forrest. Yet in the same month, Business Review Weekly, a Sydney magazine, declared him Australia's richest person, with wealth of almost A$10 billion, mainly in Fortescue shares. Six months later, he has lost the status. In a sign of the mining boom's rollercoaster ride, Fortescue's share price, like those of other commodities companies, has fallen steeply since the financial crisis hit.
Mr Forrest maintains the wealth ranking means little to him. ""I want to enjoy life, have fun and be useful,"" he says in his Perth office, a relatively modest affair compared with the towers his two global competitors occupy up the street. Fun or not, they have been forced to take Mr Forrest seriously. Cloud Break, Fortescue's only operating mine, lies in isolated desert, near the dry Fortescue River, about 270km south-east of Port Hedland (see map). When BHP refused Mr Forrest's request for commercial access to its railway line, he built his own line next to it. Wayne Swan, Australia's treasurer, ruled last month that both BHP and Rio Tinto must allow Fortescue access to their Pilbara railway lines to boost mining competition. The two big companies have indicated they may appeal against the ruling.
In what he calls ""the most important part of anything I've ever stood for"", Mr Forrest has also persuaded Mr Rudd to back a scheme he initiated to create 50,000 jobs for indigenous Australians within two years across all industries, not just mining. The issue is especially sensitive in the ore-rich Pilbara, where aborigines comprise 20% of the population (compared with 2% Australia-wide). Mr Forrest grew up there, and saw to his dismay children ""equal to me in the classroom and on the sports field"" end up on welfare, while he and other whites forged ahead.
The job-creation plan now seems ambitious. The Treasury predicts the global slowdown will lift national unemployment to 5% next year, and to almost 6% in 2010. Rio Tinto, the Pilbara's biggest operator, has 11 mines including Tom Price, the oldest and still one of the richest in ore quality. Just before the crisis, Sam Walsh, Rio's iron-ore chief in Perth, declared it had invested all its Pilbara earnings from the past five years, around A$9 billion, into expanding its export capacity by 60%. This week, by contrast, Rio cut annual-production targets by 20m tonnes.
Despite the slump, the miners are staying outwardly optimistic. Tom Albanese, Rio's chief executive, says gamely that China's slowdown will be short and sharp. He expects ""rebounding"" demand in 2009. BHP, in the throes of a takeover bid for Rio, has announced no production cuts so far. Fortescue, possibly the most vulnerable of the three because of its sole reliance on iron ore, has delayed next year's planned production target until 2010. Graeme Rowley, Fortescue's executive director, argues nevertheless that China's need for iron ore and steel to continue its ""revolution"" of building new cities means that ""Australia will remain constructively and very positively part of China's future"". The pace at which that happens will decide not just Australia's capacity to avoid the worst of the global downturn. It may also determine the outcome of a David-and-Goliath battle of raw capitalism in the Pilbara.","China 's appetite for its minerals offers Australia some shelter from the storm

KEVIN RUDD'S love of foreign summitry is doing him no harm at home; if anything, it reinforces the Australian prime minister's image as a capable leader tackling the effects of the global credit crunch. Mr Rudd has spent nearly two of his first 12 months in office abroad. His first anniversary in power on November 24th was spent flying home from an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru.
An opinion poll gave the government a ten-point lead (after distributing votes under Australia's preferential system) over the conservative coalition that ran Australia for four terms under John Howard--higher than its vote at the 2007 election. As preferred prime minister, Mr Rudd scored a 42-point lead over Malcolm Turnbull, the second leader of the conservative Liberal Party since Mr Howard's demise.
But if the financial crisis has strengthened Mr Rudd--an opinion poll in mid-November showed 68% of voters approved his handling of the economy--it may yet store up troubles. Australia's first Labor leader in almost 12 years faces a crucial test: how to implement his bold plans during the rest of his first term, and at the same time keep the economy out of recession. 
Mr Rudd's early ratification of the Kyoto protocol on climate change, and his apology to indigenous Australians, made his government look serious about keeping its electoral promises. Once a bit of an enigma, Mr Rudd has since projected an image that Australians seem to like: a hard-working (if slightly dull and wordy) leader with tight control over his ministers and calm assurance over policy. In another break with the past, he has taken cabinet meetings out of the cocoon of Canberra to the Northern Territory, Tasmania and other remote corners of Australia, where locals are encouraged to air their gripes. 
But his challenges may only be starting. Mr Rudd campaigned last year as a ""fiscal conservative"", pitching a case to voters that Labor was at least the coalition's match as an economic manager. Since the financial crisis arrived, he has showed he is prepared to ditch that to stimulate a slowing economy. In mid-October, the government offered A$10.4 billion ($6.7 billion) to pensioners, families and first-home buyers. The cash will arrive just in time for Christmas spending. Two more packages followed this month: about A$6 billion to help Australia's ailing car industry, a big employer; and A$300 million divided between 400 mayors to spend on repairing town halls, building parks and other local-government projects. 
All this has raised questions about whether Mr Rudd can keep the rest of his promises. His economic plan had assumed that hefty budget surpluses would pay for upgrades of schools, hospitals and creaking infrastructure. But the Treasury announced recently that the 2008-09 surplus of almost A$22 billion had been slashed by almost three-quarters, largely thanks to the credit crunch. Some economists say deficits after that are almost inevitable. After presiding over three interest-rate cuts since September, Glenn Stevens, the central-bank governor, has suggested that deficits in the current economic climate, in fact, were no bad thing if they finance ""worthwhile"" projects. He said that Australia's biggest mistake would not be to go into deficit, but ""to talk ourselves into unnecessary economic weakness"". 
But Mr Rudd's two most ambitious plans are yet to play out: a reform of Australia's 107-year-old federal structure, and an emissions-trading scheme due to start in 2010. His government's standing may well hinge on his skill in pursuing these plans in the teeth of the financial crisis.

GATHERING in Port Moresby, capital of Papua New Guinea, Pacific Island leaders this week gave an absent friend an ultimatum. They told Fiji's coup leader, Frank Bainimarama, that if he fails to announce credible plans for an election this year, Fiji will face suspension from the Pacific Islands Forum. If Mr Bainimarama's international standing is on the line, so is the Forum's own credibility.
Mr Bainimarama, who took office as interim prime minister after a coup in December 2006, stayed away from the meeting in Port Moresby, a Forum summit. He pleaded pressing domestic duties after severe floods in Fiji in early January. Few in Fiji believe that excuse. More likely, he was embarrassed to face the Forum after breaking a firm promise to hold elections by March 2009. This is not the first time Fiji's coup leader has snubbed a regional summit: last August he failed to attend a similar meeting in Niue, one of the microstate members of the Forum. Confirming the impression of disarray in Fiji diplomatic circles, the most senior official in the foreign ministry was forced to resign this month after saying on local television that he wished Mr Bainimarama would indeed attend the Port Moresby meeting.
Mr Bainimarama insists that sweeping electoral reforms have to be enacted before the next polls. These, he says, could then be held 12-15 months later. He claims that Fiji's voting laws have fuelled racism and underpinned the country's ""coup culture"", which has seen elected governments toppled in 1987, 2000 and 2006. His government wants to ditch Fiji's highly complex voting system, lower the voting age from 21 to 18 and abolish race-based electoral rolls, under which the country's 57% indigenous population vote separately from the 38% Fiji Indians. All these proposals may be sensible enough. But Mr Bainimarama has no mandate to enact any of them. To solve that conundrum, he hopes that the Commonwealth and the United Nations will help him arrange a ""President's Forum"" aimed at persuading Fiji's political parties to sign up to his reform package. But New Zealand's prime minister, John Key, has rejected UN and Commonwealth intervention, saying that the Forum is the right body to deal with Fiji. 
In Port Moresby both Mr Key and Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, pressed for a tough response on Fiji. Other Pacific leaders, including the host, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Sir Michael Somare, urged a milder approach, more in tune with what they like to call the ""Pacific way"". After the final communique, Mr Rudd said that there was unanimity, and that Fiji will be automatically suspended from the Forum if no road-map towards an election is agreed by May 1st. Not everyone shares Mr Rudd's confidence. 
Mr Bainimarama's initial, unscripted reaction was belligerent, likening the ultimatum to a declaration of war. With luck, wiser counsel will prevail. If the communique strengthens the position of moderates in his interim cabinet, and produces a firm electoral timetable, it will have achieved a useful purpose. But if Mr Bainimarama and his shadowy Military Council continue to reject any plans for a return to democracy, the Pacific Islands Forum will be forced to act later this year, or risk losing whatever credibility it still enjoys.","The neighbours worry about Fiji

HAVING inherited a booming economy when he led Australia's Labor Party to power in late 2007, Kevin Rudd predicted optimistically last October that his country would avoid a recession during the global downturn. Now he is sounding more worried, and acting more defensively. This week he announced a stimulus package worth A$42 billion ($27 billion), one of the biggest in the country's history. The government, he declared, would ""move heaven and earth"" to keep the economy growing. Barely a corner of Australian life will be untouched by the spending spree.
Yet there is no guarantee it will achieve its aim. The immediate trigger for the stimulus was a Treasury report that the global recession had slashed A$115 billion from forecast revenue up to 2012. While six of Australia's top ten export markets are already in recession, the chief impact has come from the slowdown in one that is not: China, its biggest trading partner, and the main driver of a minerals boom that has fed fat company-tax revenues. Such booms have worked magic to keep ""the lucky country"" out of trouble before. But not now. Lindsay Tanner, the finance minister, cites figures showing how much Australia had come to depend on such revenues, and the shock when they abruptly fade away: at the latest boom's peak, company taxes had grown to a quarter of federal revenue, from just 9% in the mid-1980s.
Growth forecasts for 2008-09 have now slid from 2.75% in last May's budget to 1%, and to just 0.75% for next year. Mr Tanner concedes such figures are a bit ""anaemic"", but says the chances of staying out of recession are still ""reasonable"". Some economists are less optimistic. The test will be whether Mr Rudd's stimulus has the right targets. About a third will go in cash handouts of almost A$1,000 each to encourage low- and middle-income workers, farmers and students to spend. A similar stimulus of A$10.4 billion late last year seems to have worked: after two months of weak demand, it helped push retail spending in December up by 3.8%.
But the bulk of Mr Rudd's stimulus, almost A$30 billion, will go on infrastructure: new school buildings, road repairs and house insulation. And more is on the way. A body Mr Rudd appointed under Sir Rod Eddington, a businessman, is due to report soon on much bigger demands for public cash, such as for railways, ports and energy grids. Already, the revenue slump and stimulus spending have ended more than a decade of budget surpluses; the latest estimates project combined deficits of A$118 billion over the next four years.
On January 31st Mr Rudd prepared the ideological ground for this shift with a much-discussed article in the Monthly, a magazine. He blamed the global crisis on neoliberalism, or ""free-market fundamentalism--and excessive greed"". Social democracy, he wrote, must now ""prevent liberal capitalism from cannibalising itself"". This was also about claiming the political high ground. Mr Rudd accused the Liberal Party, the main opposition party, which ruled for 11 years before the crisis, of being Australia's neoliberals. Malcolm Turnbull, the Liberal leader, wants tax cuts, not public spending, to boost the economy, and opposes the stimulus package. 
The central bank cut interest rates by a percentage point to a cash rate of 3.25% on the day Mr Rudd announced his stimulus, the fifth cut since September. Glenn Stevens, the bank's governor, says the monetary and fiscal changes will help to ""cushion"" the economy. If Australia nonetheless goes into recession, Mr Rudd and Mr Turnbull will keep trading charges on who is to blame: neoliberals or big spenders.","Kevin Rudd shops for a recovery

A WEEK after bushfires started blazing across parts of southern Australia, the country was still coming to grips with one of the most traumatic events in its peacetime history. The fires that erupted on February 7th in Victoria, the second-most populous state, killed more than 180 people. Police say the toll could reach 300. The final count will be left to authorities with the grim task of sifting through landscapes blackened by flames so ferocious that they melted car parts and devoured buildings in seconds. 
In one of Australia's hottest summer seasons on record, about 50 fires also raged across New South Wales, the most populous state, without loss of life. But it was neighbouring Victoria that bore the most devastating brunt. The state is prone to hot winds driving in from deserts, fanning flames whose ""scale and savagery"", says Stephen Pyne, an American fire expert, ""have no equal elsewhere on earth.""
This week's fires easily outstripped the worst two previous ones: ""Black Friday"" in January 1939, when 71 people died in Victoria; and ""Ash Wednesday"" in February 1983, which took 75 lives in Victoria and neighbouring South Australia. This time, a prolonged drought gripping south-east Australia, and temperatures staying above 40[degrees]C for days, made for a lethally dry terrain to fuel the flames.
More than 30 fires spread from Horsham, in western Victoria, to the Latrobe Valley in the east, burning out 360,000 hectares (868,000 acres). The worst raged in a mountainous region only 70km (43 miles) north of Melbourne, and almost wiped out Kinglake and Marysville, two idyllic old towns; up to one-fifth of Marysville's 500 residents might have died. Ian Pearson, a Marysville survivor, described the town now as ""the inside of hell"".
As firefighting crews battled the blazes, authorities blamed arsonists for starting some, and even relighting others that had been brought under control. Police have arrested two suspected looters and are treating some locations as crime scenes. After touring Victoria for two days, Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, called the deliberate lighting of fires ""mass murder"".
Australians put aside their obsession with grim economic news, and responded to one of their country's worst natural disasters with a mixture of grief and grit akin to wartime. They donated almost A$34m ($22m) to help ravaged communities and about 5,000 people left homeless, on top of A$15m Mr Rudd pledged.
Fires, floods and drought are part of Australia's national legend: ""her beauty and her terror"", as Dorothea Mackellar wrote in a 1908 poem recited by every Australian schoolchild ever since. Yet the human cost of this catastrophe shocked even fire experts. A commission of inquiry set up by John Brumby, Victoria's premier, will examine Australia's fire-management strategy. Controlled burning in cooler months, to reduce fuel loads, was given up in many places after city people protested about smoke hazes. The government of Victoria's advice to people in fire paths--leave early or fortify properties and stay--seems to have unravelled. Kevin Tolhurst, a Melbourne ecologist, suggests many were overwhelmed, fled at the last minute--""the worst time""--and were trapped.
Debate has started, too, about the fire's intensity. Some are linking Australia's heatwave and decade-long drought to climate change. In a report to Mr Rudd's government late last year Ross Garnaut, an economist, forecast that the number of days each year in Melbourne hotter than 35[degrees]C will rise from nine now to 21 in 2070. He said fire seasons were projected to start earlier, end later and be more intense. Mr Rudd has promised that shattered townships will be rebuilt ""brick by brick"". It may also be worth considering precisely where and how they should be built.","The worst wildfires on record give Australia a week in hell

THE beaches near Brisbane are usually among the world's most pristine, helping to generate tourism revenue of about A$1.3 billion ($850m) a year for Queensland's capital and Australia's third-largest city. But more than a week after oil gushed from a cargo ship off the city's shoreline, many were still covered in black sludge. Apart from turning into one of Australia's worst environmental disasters, the spillage swamped a state election campaign in Queensland where the economic policies of Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, were under scrutiny.
The spill happened on March 11th when the Pacific Adventurer, registered in Hong Kong, sailed into heavy seas whipped up by Cyclone Hamish. Her cargo of containers of ammonium nitrate fertiliser rolled overboard, puncturing the ship and releasing oil. At first Swire Shipping, the owner, thought the leak was small. Australian authorities later estimated it at 250,000 litres. Some oil reached beaches 60km (37.5 miles) north of Brisbane along the Sunshine Coast, a tourist playground and one of Australia's fastest-growing regions. Moreton, a sandy island off Brisbane much prized by ecotourists, has had to contend with oil washing up on its beaches and beating against its cliffs.
It was Australia's third environmental disaster in a matter of weeks. In February bushfires ravaged Victoria, leaving at least 210 people dead, and floods swamped north Queensland. Peter Newman, a professor of sustainability and an adviser on adapting Australian cities for global warming, links all three calamities to changing climate patterns. ""A hurricane causing an oil spillage is a symbol of the future we're trying to avoid,"" he says.
The disaster also blighted the re-election campaign of Anna Bligh, Queensland's premier for the past 18 months. Voting is due on March 21st. Campbell Newman, Brisbane's conservative mayor, accused the 11-year-old state Labor government of acting too slowly to clean up the mess. Hundreds of workers with rakes and spades fanned across beaches to dump oil-soaked sand into plastic bags. The job is unlikely to be finished until Easter.
Mr Rudd, a Queenslander himself, flew to Brisbane to campaign for his fellow Labor leader. Alluding not to the oil spillage, but to his bid to boost Australia's flagging economy before it happened, he promised to help Ms Bligh ""steer Queensland through the stormy economic seas that lie ahead"". Keeping Labor support steady in his home state will be vital for his own fortunes long after the beaches are pristine again.

POLITICIANS often come to power with grand visions for reshaping their country's relations with the rest of the world--because, if they told the truth, and admitted they were only going to tinker with what they had inherited, think how boring that would be. But Kevin Rudd, who became Australia's prime minister in 2007, has better reason than most for describing his meeting with Barack Obama in Washington on March 24th as the start of a ""new and important chapter in the Australia- United States relationship"". 
The previous chapter, under John Howard, Mr Rudd's conservative predecessor, had earned Australia the unflattering title of America's ""deputy sheriff"", thanks to Mr Howard's unstinting support for George Bush on Iraq and much else. According to Stephen Smith, Australia's foreign minister, the Rudd government got rid of that reputation when it withdrew the country's combat troops from Iraq last year. Now Mr Rudd wants to go further, building up Australia's ties in East Asia and working more through multilateral institutions, while seeking to be a partner of, not a deputy to, America.
The first test of that ambition will come in Afghanistan. Mr Rudd has always backed the war but support for it among Australians has dropped steeply from the two-thirds of 2001. An opinion poll on March 24th showed just 28% agreed with the idea of sending more troops to reinforce the 1,100 there now. Ten Australian soldiers have died, two since mid-March. Mr Rudd says he will listen to any request from America for more troops after Mr Obama's review of the Afghanistan strategy, ""but listening...does not necessarily mean agreeing.""
A bigger test will be his capacity to get Mr Obama's backing for Australia's ideas in East Asia. Some of these remain fuzzy. Mr Rudd's pledge to make Australia ""the most Asia-literate country in the collective West"" basically involves pouring money into Asian language and culture courses in schools and universities. But he also took to Washington an ambitious scheme for a new Asia Pacific Community which, he hopes, will transform Asia's diplomatic architecture. Australia has sounded out 21 countries as possible members, including America, China, India and Japan. 
As Mr Rudd sees it, China's emergence as an economic giant opens up political and security challenges that would be best handled by a new institution, not Asia's plethora of existing bodies. In a speech in Singapore last year, Mr Rudd suggested that Australia and other regional countries should seek to ""influence China's view of its role and responsibility"".
The Obama administration has pledged only to talk about this. But Mr Rudd is likely to lobby hard. Allan Gyngell, head of the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think-tank, argues that he dominates foreign policy more than any Australian prime minister before him. At the least, turning the former deputy sheriff into a partner will do him no harm at home. It may even give him more clout in Asia.","Kevin Rudd lobbies Barack Obama to support Kevin Rudd's grand plans for Asia 
 POLITICIANS often come to power with grand visions for reshaping their country 's relations with the rest of the world -- because , if they told the truth , and admitted they were only going to tinker with what they had inherited , think how boring that would be . But Kevin Rudd's has better reason than most for describing Kevin Rudd's meeting with Barack Obama in Washington on March 24th as the start of a "" new and important chapter in the Australia- United States relationship "" . 
 The previous chapter , under John Howard , Kevin Rudd's conservative predecessor , had earned Australia the unflattering title of America 's "" deputy sheriff "" , thanks to Mr Howard 's unstinting support for George Bush on Iraq and much else . According to Stephen Smith , Australia 's foreign minister , the Kevin Rudd government got rid of that reputation when it withdrew the country 's combat troops from Iraq last year . Now Kevin Rudd wants to go further , building up Australia 's ties in East Asia and working more through multilateral institutions , while seeking to be a partner of , not a deputy to , America .

A WEALTHY Mexican walked into an exclusive shop in Vail, Colorado, late last year and picked out $11,000-worth of clothes to lay on the counter. He perused them for a minute, then offered the sales assistant $6,000 for the lot. The shop countered with an offer of $6,800.
The rich are economising, and the businesses that deal with them are having to cope. In a survey of wealthy individuals conducted by Harrison Group, 80% said they were looking at each spending category to see what they could save, 77% were buying fewer big-ticket items and 78% were waiting for the sales before buying such items. Across the board, Harrison's Jim Taylor reckons the wealthy are spending 30% less than before, the sole exception being items for their children. 
Claudia d'Arpizio of Bain Consulting reckons that the luxury-goods market probably grew by only 1% last year, having suffered heavily in the fourth quarter. A dramatic estimate of the decline during the holiday season was made by SpendingPulse, part of the MasterCard credit group, which calculated that luxury-goods spending between November 1st and December 24th 2008 was down 34% year-on-year. Bain thinks the first half of this year will also look grim. 
The effects are showing up across the industry. Bulgari of Italy reported a 17% drop in jewellery sales and a 28% decline in watches in the fourth quarter; Tiffany's said sales in its American stores dropped 35% in November and December; Richemont, a Geneva-based group with brands such as Cartier, saw its sales fall by 12% in the three months to December. LVMH did rather better than the rest, reporting revenue growth of 4% in the fourth quarter, although the watches and wine divisions suffered small drops year-on-year.
Moreover, shoppers for luxury goods can be frustratingly inconsistent. Although the overall trend is down, demand in one shop can be up 50% one day and down 50% the next. Manufacturers and retailers find it hard to budget or plan stock levels. 
The wealthy are cutting back on leisure spending as well. According to Smith Travel Research, in the week ending February 21st occupancy rates in luxury hotels were 17.5% down on the same period in 2008, and revenue per room was 27.5% lower. That has caught out some hotel owners who took on too much debt; in Colorado, the owner of the Vail Plaza Hotel & Club filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October.
Vivian Deuschl of the Ritz-Carlton hotel group says corporate bookings have been particularly badly hit. This has become known as the ""AIG effect"", after the insurance group that was rescued by the American government last autumn and several times more since. Shortly after the first bail-out it emerged that the group had spent $440,000 on a spa retreat for salesmen. Political outrage at the junket led other companies to rethink their plans. ""Even if businesses have money,"" says Ms Deuschl, ""they are very skittish about spending it at luxury hotels."" 
In addition, the conference market is taking a hit because of the business downturn. The Fairmont hotel in Monte Carlo, which is close to the Grimaldi conference centre, says events are being booked at much shorter notice. Some hotels are reacting to this by trimming non-essential spending; using potted plants as decorations, for example, instead of fresh flowers that have to be replaced every day. 
Just like flowers, servants are being pruned. David Gonzales of the Domestic Placement Network in southern California says that a number of chefs have lost their jobs. Live-in chefs are very expensive to maintain and their employers can economise by eating out more, entertaining less and using contract caterers when they have dinner parties at home. 
Nor has the crisis driven the wealthy to drink. Champagne exports fell by 4.8% last year. An index of fine-wine prices dropped by 18% after the Lehman Brothers collapse; Simon Staples of Berry Bros & Rudd, a London-based fine-wine merchant, says that some prices have dropped by 40%. But that still leaves the prices of some vintages, such as the sought-after 2005s, well above their initial levels. Flash fatigue
There seem to be two main reasons why the wealthy are tightening their purse strings. The obvious one is the hit to their portfolios from the equity and property markets. ""It's not just that they've lost money,"" says Russ Prince of Prince & Associates. ""They're not sure how much more they're going to lose."" 
The second reason is a feeling that it is wrong to show off at a time when the economy is in recession and people are feeling poor. Conspicuous consumption is out. The top end of the watch market is suffering, not least because such watches are often bought out of bonuses in the financial sector, which have largely dried up.
Mr Taylor of Harrison Research points to a boom in sales of used luxury cars. ""You don't want to pull up in your driveway with a new Mercedes when you know your neighbour is suffering."" Tastes may shift from the flashy to the practical; cashmere knitwear may still be acceptable whereas extreme fashion is not.
All this comes after many boom years in the luxury sector. An indication of the demand for top-of-the-range goods can be found in Forbes magazine's ""cost of living extremely well"" index which includes items such as facelifts, fur coats and Gucci loafers. It almost quadrupled between 1982 and 2006, whereas the broadly based consumer-price index merely doubled. 
Stephen Abery of the broker Fraser Yachts says that roughly half of the world's 100 biggest yachts have been built since 2000. Some are more than 150 metres long, half as much again as a football pitch. Even a 70-metre version could cost EUR 100m to build. And what with a dedicated crew, mooring, fuel and insurance, the annual running costs will be in the millions. 
The cost of finding trained crew has gone up sharply in recent years, says Mr Abery, although the trend has softened recently. Wages for domestic servants have also shot up: Mr Gonzales says demand has tripled in recent years. Steven Ferry of the International Institute of Modern Butlers says there has been a big jump in the use of butlers in hotels, where they serve the occupant of a suite or a range of suites. 
It is not quite a return to the world of P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves (a valet, not a butler), who looked after Bertie Wooster. Modern butlers often act as household managers rather than serving up drinks on silver trays. Their employers tend to be asset-rich and time-poor and need staff to maintain a range of properties. 
The market for luxury goods and services is highly stratified. There is a big gap between those who can afford a butler and those whose only foray into the market is to buy a Gucci handbag. Marc Cohen of Ledbury Research points out that the high-profile wealthy make up only 0.1% of consumers; luxury-goods groups have to aim a bit wider to do well. But expansion can create a dilemma. If it is overdone, a brand can lose its cachet. 
Guy Salter of Walpole, a British luxury-goods association, says the industry has done so well for so long that it lost sight of some of the issues. ""A hundred years ago luxury-goods manufacturers were small family-owned businesses who knew their customer base very well. By the 1970s and 1980s there were lots of people flocking to buy luxury goods who were happy to pay for the flash and the logo. The companies stretched the elastic too far,"" he argues. Crafting a new strategy
The recession may cause manufacturers to rethink their strategy. Ledbury's Mr Cohen says the wealthy may decide they will buy fewer things but will go for higher quality: less bling and more craftsmanship. This may favour a group such as Bottega Veneta which produces handbags without a logo but with a distinctive stitching pattern.
Another group that thinks it can benefit from the change in mood is NetJets, which allows both the rich and the corporate elite to fly privately without the expense of owning their planes. The company says the average corporate client spends EUR 700,000-800,000 a year, compared with the EUR 17m-18m it would cost to buy a mid-size jet. NetJets is hiring 12 new salespeople in a bid to capture market share; it may be helped by the fact that owning a jet has come to symbolise corporate excess. 
Most companies associated with the luxury-goods market, however, will have to adjust to a decline in demand. Mr Salter says that manufacturers cannot react to the squeeze by cutting costs unless they can maintain quality. ""Integrity comes from having craftsmen,"" he says. ""The wealthy are not going to economise on good taste.""
Luca Virgilio, who runs the Hotel Metropole in Monaco, says it would be a mistake for him to compromise on quality; clients visit the hotel precisely because it is luxurious. Rather than cutting prices, the hotel is offering more services for the same price in an effort to keep clients loyal. 
It is a tough call to make. Keeping standards and prices high maintains elite appeal but risks losing some customers to lower-cost alternatives. What makes the call even more difficult is that the ranks of the rich have changed over the past 20 years; old money has become less important. ""A lot of the wealth of the past 20-30 years is self-made and they are looking for value,"" says Walpole's Mr Salter. ""Most of even the super-rich were middle-class 20 years ago."" Cheap thrills
Retailers' plans were thrown into disarray when Saks Fifth Avenue decided to cut prices on designer clothes by up to 70% even before the start of the holiday season (defined as Thanksgiving to Christmas). The strategy helped Saks avoid being burdened with excess stock in January, but rival shops were made to look very expensive and felt they had to follow suit. 
Nordstrom, a department-store group, reported a 68% fall in fourth-quarter net profit, thanks to a decline in margins prompted by price cuts. The markdowns solved the immediate problem of excess stock but did nothing to solve the medium-term issue of slumping demand; the Seattle-based retailer is forecasting a 10-15% decline in same-store sales this year. There is also the longer-term question of whether consumers might get hooked on price cuts. ""The very big discounts by department stores may have created a dangerous attitude in shoppers, that it is a little bit irrational to pay the full price,"" says Bain's Ms d'Arpizio. 
Many of the wealthy may be migrating to the internet. Mr Salter cites a survey showing that they are happy to buy online; some 40% said they preferred net-based shopping because they felt uncomfortable going into luxury-goods stores. But online shopping holds its own dangers. Last year a French court fined eBay EUR 40m for allowing auctions of fake luxury items on its site. The problem of counterfeiting may get worse as wallets get squeezed.
Senior people in the industry admit this is going to be a very difficult year. The best they can hope for is that the rich will concentrate their spending on the highest-quality stuff. Cutting corners can be a false economy; a cheap handbag, one expert argues, can drag down the rest of a woman's outfit. Manufacturers think it is better to accept lower sales than lower margins. They worry that just by trying to get through 12-18 months of crisis, they might be ruining their brands. But it is a big bet, and some of those brands will not survive.","Designer belts are being tightened

Together with another boat arrival on April 22nd, the drama has inflamed a political conflict on a subject many Australians thought they had put to rest: their tolerance for refugees escaping strife in countries to the north.
The explosion also posed the first test of the promise by Kevin Rudd, the Labor prime minister, of a more humane approach to refugees. Reports soon emerged of fuel being poured on deck.

He and his ministers claimed asylum-seekers on one boat had thrown their children into the sea to intimidate the authorities. The claim was later proved false. The Rudd government has dropped two of Mr Howard's approaches: sending people to camps in Pacific island-nations while their asylum bids were assessed; and granting approved refugees restrictive, three-year visas.
Since the changes, the number of arriving boats has climbed: 14 in 2008-09 compared with three the previous year. But boat people comprised only a fraction of the 4,750 asylum applications Australia received last year, a small enough number compared with those in some other rich countries. In any case John Gibson, president of the Refugee Council of Australia, an NGO, argues the old temporary visas drew more, not fewer, boat people. He says many of the 353 people who drowned on one boat in October 2001 were Afghan and Iraqi women and children trying to reach men in Australia whose temporary visas shut their families out.
There are signs Australians' attitudes have softened since then. In an opinion poll on April 20th, 57% thought tougher policies would not deter boat people. Pictures of doctors treating 40-odd people from the blazing boat have humanised their plight. Much improved relations with Indonesia should promise stronger action against people smugglers. Indonesia agreed this week to extradite Hadi Ahmadi, whom Australia wants to prosecute for his alleged involvement in four boat arrivals involving 900 people in 2001.

Last November, when China announced its first big, 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) economic stimulus in response to the downturn, Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, was among the foreigners cheering loudest, calling it ""very good news"". The sense of relief was understandable. Taking goods and services together, China is now Australia's biggest trading partner. The slump may slow this trend down, but not change its direction. 
Yet on a recent visit to Canberra, a capital whose eerily empty streets and subterranean parliament suggest a Pyongyang without the dystopia, Banyan found politicians and policy pundits in a quandary over how to handle both China and the recent upwelling of popular Australian antipathy towards the Chinese government. For all that China is Australia's second-biggest export market, with huge potential for growth, it is also a dictatorial power whose policies anger many Australians. Moreover, its commercial expansionism is accompanied by growing military strength. Defence strategists, who are paid to think the worst, now see the biggest potential threat to Australian security not as an unstoppable influx of Indonesian boat people, but as China. 
One by-product of the slump, a rash of Chinese companies snapping up stakes in Australian mining enterprises in response to tumbling share and commodity prices, has provoked a popular backlash. To the mining companies, the colour of China's money is dazzling. But, though the Chinese onslaught looks fractious and pell-mell, conspiracy theorists smell a state-driven attack on the commanding heights of Australia's economy. They have succeeded in whipping up an anti-China mood. In March Australia blocked China Minmetals' acquisition of OZ Minerals, a copper and gold producer, on security grounds. A ruling over an even bigger deal is pending, having been delayed until mid-June. This will cover the $19.5 billion bid by Chinalco, an aluminium company, for nearly 20% of cash-strapped Rio Tinto. 
The government's decision, on whether national security is at stake in this transaction, may be the hardest it has had to make since coming to power in late 2007. It seems certain that the prime minister wants the purchase to go through. If it does, it will lead to renewed charges in Australia and around the region that he is soft on China as it seeks to extend its tentacles. After all, Mr Rudd was once posted to Beijing for the foreign service. In 2007 Chinese diplomats at a reception nearly choked on their canapes when Mr Rudd, then leader of the opposition, made a speech in faultless Mandarin. The prime minister, John Howard of the (conservative) Liberal Party, looked on with ill-disguised fury. Then, in a speech at Peking University last year, Mr Rudd described Australia as China's zhengyou, its ""true friend"". Mr Howard had nailed his colours to the mast of Australia's alliance with the United States, and after September 11th relished being America's ""deputy sheriff"" in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr Rudd, by contrast, has urged world leaders to accept a greater role for China. The opposition sneers at him as China's ""roving ambassador"".
There is enough force in this accusation to unsettle Mr Rudd. In Britain for the G20 summit in early April, he was caught on camera squirming in embarrassment at being seated next to Fu Ying, China's sophisticated ambassador to Britain (and, before that, Australia). Yet the slur is misplaced all the same. Mr Rudd has few illusions about China. He once wrote a thesis on Wei Jingsheng, one of China's most persecuted dissidents. Briefly out of a political job a decade ago, he trudged around China alone trying in vain to collect unpaid debts for Western firms. Last year he watched the Chinese embassy in Canberra orchestrate squads of Chinese students in Australia to smother pro-Tibet demonstrations. It was, says one of Mr Rudd's friends, a crucial moment: the first time a foreign power had denied freedom of expression to Australians in their own homeland. When Mr Rudd spoke of zhengyou last year, he used it in the dictionary definition of the term, as a ""friend who will give forthright admonition"", as over China's handling of Tibet. China prefers lao pengyou, ""old friends"", preferably sycophantic ones. A stake in Australia's heart
Indeed Mr Rudd appears to have a keener sense than Mr Howard of a growing strategic dilemma. On the one hand, Australia's crackerjack fit with the Chinese economy is reshaping Australia's trade and investment flows, drawing the country into a China-centred Asian orbit. On the other, Australia's security hangs on America's continued presence in the western Pacific. A long-awaited defence white paper that is soon to appear is expected to recommend heavily strengthened armed forces. A central question is what Australia should do as the primacy of the American sheriff fades and China's power grows. Worst of all for Australia would be if one day it had to choose between the United States and China--possibly over Taiwan.
The urge to avoid having to make such a choice partly explains Mr Rudd's idea of an Asia-Pacific community, a framework for regional co-operation that he mentioned last year. Misread as a vague expression of pan-Asian sentiment, this is in essence a possible plan of action. For a start, offer China a say in helping to build predictable economic and security norms for the region. As a Rudd adviser puts it of the Rio Tinto decision: what is the point of asking China to be a responsible stakeholder if it isn't offered a stake? But, if the attempt to tame China goes horribly awry, make sure America is still around to help sort out the mess.","For all China 's commercial charms , Australia still looks to America as Asia 's sheriff

FLANKED by Australia's senior soldiers, Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, stood on a navy frigate in Sydney Harbour on May 2nd and talked of likely future tensions in Asia and the Pacific. He was launching Australia's first defence white paper in almost a decade. The show of naval muscle was calculated. His government plans a military build-up over the next 20 years as a hedge against the tensions, which it worries are most likely to come from China.
There will be only a modest rise in the number of military personnel, of about 3,000 to 57,000. But the navy and air force will get the hardware to build what the paper calls a ""heavier and more potent maritime force"". The submarine fleet will be replaced and doubled in size to 12. There will be a new fleet of 11 frigates and air-warfare destroyers, equipped, like the submarines, with cruise missiles. The air force will get about 100 new fighter-bombers. Mr Rudd calls the build-up ""the most powerful, integrated and sophisticated set of military capabilities"" Australia has had. It is estimated to cost around A$100 billion ($74 billion).
But what is it for? For most of its life, Australia has relied for its security on the naval presence in the Pacific region of first Britain then, since the second world war, America. The paper predicts that China's rise as an economic and military giant could well end all that. It sees China as possibly becoming the world's biggest economy by 2020. That, plus its military modernisation and the testing of America's primacy, could give China's regional neighbours ""cause for concern"".
This implies China has now replaced Indonesia as the main strategic threat to Australia. But the paper talks only of a remote but plausible confrontation with ""a major-power adversary"". The new hardware's priority will be defending Australia's northern approaches from the Indian Ocean via the Timor Sea to Polynesia. The American alliance will remain pivotal. But Australia will no longer put troops at risk ""in distant theatres of war where we have no direct interests"" (read Iraq, but perhaps not Afghanistan).
Self-reliance is one thing. How Australia's region will respond to its apparent preoccupation with China as a possible future adversary is another. Mr Rudd seems keen not to let China's status as Australia's biggest trading partner override its security concerns. But Hugh White, a defence analyst, and an author of the last white paper in 2000, worries that this one lacks answers on how this can be achieved. ""It's reluctant to tell Australians that we have to think seriously about living in an Asia that will be very different from anything we have known,"" he says.","Why , despite the slump , Australia wants to lavish money on its armed forces

FOR more than a decade, Australia had enjoyed one of the biggest booms in its history, and a robust series of budget surpluses. When Kevin Rudd led the Labor Party to power in 2007, he promised, as a ""fiscal conservative"" to keep this ball rolling. But when Wayne Swan, his treasurer (finance minister), presented the government's second budget on May 12th, the ball had suddenly stopped. Mr Swan delivered an underlying cash deficit for 2009-10 of almost A$58 billion ($44 billion), or 4.9% of GDP, one of the largest ever. Only last year, an A$20 billion surplus was forecast. The lucky country's reversal of fortune could hardly have been starker. 
It mirrors the global downturn, but especially that in China, Australia's biggest trading partner. Just before the budget, the central bank revised earlier hopes that Australia might plough through all this. It says the economy has been contracting since late last year, and it will shrink by 0.5% up to mid-2010. This may sound mild compared with other rich countries. But the slump in commodity markets and prices has blown a hole in record company profits that underwrote much of the boom. The Treasury says that tax revenues over the next four years will now be A$210 billion less than expected.
This posed a stark choice for Mr Rudd. He has promised big spending on health, education and attacking climate change. Now, he has either to find some way of financing his plans, such as tax hikes, or to drop them. He chose neither course. Buoyed by public and pundit support for two stimulus packages since October, he turned the budget largely into a third stimulus. It invests A$22 billion in infrastructure, including ports, interstate roads and new railways in Australia's big cities. Clean-energy projects, mainly solar and carbon capture from burning coal, will get A$4.5 billion. Under pressure from an unlikely alliance of business and greens, Mr Rudd recently delayed by a year his plan for an emissions-trading scheme from 2010. The green budget measure turns the pressure back on his critics.
Mr Rudd plans to pay for all this by finding savings roughly equal to the infrastructure outlays. Richer Australians will sacrifice most. The government will slash tax breaks for private health insurance, pension contributions and other forms of middle-class welfare. Nevertheless, the government faces net debt to the tune of almost A$200 billion in four years from money it will have to borrow to cover projected deficits.
But luck has not entirely deserted Australia. Having shunned toxic assets, its four big banks look healthy. The Treasury is predicting that growth will return to boom levels of 4.5% in just two years. That must assume China's demand for Australia's commodities revives. The contraction, meanwhile, is expected to raise unemployment to 8.5%, or about 1m people, by mid-2011. This will worry Mr Rudd as he faces an election by the end of 2010. For now, he has avoided imposing quite the horror budget many had feared.","Rudd pins Kevin Rudd's hopes on Australia 's luck holding

ONCE a byword for state-run inefficiency, Telstra is now famous instead for corporate belligerence and executive arrogance. For many years the Australian telecoms giant, under its American chief executive, Sol Trujillo, was at war with regulators and successive federal governments over its plans for a high-speed broadband network. The resulting conflict resulted in grievous self-inflicted harm, not least feet peppered with buckshot.
In February, after nearly four turbulent years in charge, Mr Trujillo said he would stand down at the end of June, a year earlier than scheduled. On May 8th Telstra announced the resignation of its chairman, Donald McGauchie, who had backed his bruising style. The board has appointed two more conciliatory figures: Catherine Livingstone as chairman, and David Thodey, a Telstra insider, as chief executive.
The saga of hostility began under the previous Australian government, which refused Telstra's requests to change the rules requiring the firm to share any future high-speed network with rivals at what it regarded as unreasonably low rates. Telstra hoped the new government of Kevin Rudd, elected in 2007, would be more amenable. The firm expected to be the main beneficiary of Mr Rudd's election pledge to create a national broadband network serving 98% of the population. But when the project was put out to tender last year, Telstra treated the process with contempt, submitting a flimsy, 12-page press release rather than a detailed, formal proposal. It was a terrible miscalculation: rather than bow to a hubristic company, the government banished it from the tender process.
Then in April Mr Rudd dropped a second bombshell by announcing that none of the bids, including that from Telstra's main rival, SingTel Optus, was up to scratch. Instead, the government said it would build a high-speed national network itself, at a cost of A$43 billion ($30 billion). The new network would use the latest ""fibre to the home"" technology, rendering Telstra's existing infrastructure of copper wires obsolete within five to ten years. The firm faced a humbling defeat and a huge new competitor: the government itself. As Mark McDonnell, a telecoms analyst with BBY, put it: ""Telstra now faces an irrational investor driven by a political agenda and unconstrained by debt.""
Yet the government does not have the expertise or experience to construct a national network--an enormous undertaking in such a vast, largely unpopulated country. Newspaper advertisements have recently appeared seeking ""suitably qualified consultants"". Though Mr Rudd has predicted that the network could be built within eight years, industry insiders think that is wildly optimistic. And if the new state-owned enterprise is to get a return on the huge investment required, broadband charges for consumers will have to rise.
So it may be in the mutual interest of the government and Telstra to make peace. One possibility is that Telstra will agree to the ""functional separation"" of its retail and wholesale business, replicating the deal struck in 2005 in Britain between BT and its regulator, Ofcom. This would promote competition, which has always been the Australian regulator's chief aim, but would avoid a messy break-up of Telstra, which could then participate in the construction of the new network. Another option is the forced break-up of Telstra, but with the company taking a stake of up to 49% in the new network. .
Paul Fletcher, a former Optus employee who has written a history of Australia's broadband battles, reckons that even if Telstra manages to come to terms with the government and participate in the construction of the new network, its problems are far from over. ""Expectations are so high for the kind of national broadband network that Kevin Rudd envisages that it may be difficult for Telstra to participate in a way that generates a commercial payback,"" he warns. That, however, is a problem for another day. The immediate priority for Telstra's new bosses is to build bridges, not networks.

WAITING for the perfect wave, surf-riders at Newcastle seem oblivious to the cargo ships just beyond. A dozen are queuing to load coal from the Hunter Valley, one of Australia's biggest coal-mining regions. The black stuff pouring through Newcastle's port is one of Australia's economic linchpins, making it the world's biggest coal-exporter. As Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, tries to push through legislation to deal with global warming, coal is also one of his headaches. Opposition to Mr Rudd's plans is now so entrenched in parliament that he is contemplating calling an early election.
Australia's first coal was mined at Newcastle in 1797, less than a decade after Europeans began to settle. Australians ever since have enjoyed cheap power from this dirty source of carbon-dioxide, the main culprit of global warming. Coal generates about 83% of the country's electricity, and even more in New South Wales, the most populous state. Mr Rudd wants parliament this month to approve a scheme that would change the way Australians use energy, helping to give the country credibility at the global climate conference in Copenhagen in December.
He has saddled Greg Combet, a minister and former union leader, with the task of talking the coal industry into accepting it. The industry complains the scheme's costs will mean countries such as Indonesia will be able to undercut Australia in global coal markets. Mr Combet argues, nonetheless, that Australia's role as one of the world's biggest emitters, thanks largely to its coal-dependence, imposes a responsibility to help persuade developing countries to change their ways, too, and that Australia has to ""get stuck into this"". Not everyone agrees.
Mr Rudd led the Labor Party to power in 2007 promising action against climate-change, after the former conservative coalition had largely ignored the issue. He wants a cap-and-trade system, allowing polluters to buy permits to produce carbon dioxide and sell these to others if they cut their own emissions instead. Bowing to cries from business for more time to get ready, Mr Rudd changed the scheme last month. It will now start from mid-2011, a year later than planned. It aims to cut emissions by at least 5% of 2000 levels by 2020, and possibly 25%, depending on global action. A swag of free permits initially will go to big polluting industries, such as concrete, steel and aluminium, but not coal.
A separate A$750m ($600m) handout will help coal adapt, including by capturing methane (a more potent polluter than carbon dioxide) released from coal mines. By 2020 the government wants solar, wind and other renewable sources to generate one-fifth of Australia's power.
The Minerals Council of Australia, an industry lobby, argues that the cost of complying with the emissions scheme means about 24,000 mining industry jobs would disappear by then. It wants auctions for the permits to be introduced in phases, and not started in full, as is now planned, in 2012. Mr Combet firmly rejects a delay.
Mr Rudd's bigger worries lie in parliament. The House of Representatives, the lower house, passed the emissions-trading bill on June 4th. But the Senate, the upper house, where the government lacks a majority, could kill it. Malcolm Turnbull, leader of the main opposition Liberal Party, supports such a scheme. But he wants it delayed to buy him time to placate the powerful global-warming sceptics in his own party. Barnaby Joyce, of the junior opposition National Party, is less ambivalent. He calls Mr Rudd's plans an ""employment-termination scheme"". By contrast, Christine Milne, of the Greens, accuses Mr Rudd of ""browning the scheme down"" to try to win business and opposition support. She and her four Senate colleagues want the 25% cut in emissions as a minimum target, not a maximum one.
Experts have linked recent devastating bushfires in Victoria and floods in Queensland to changing climate patterns. This has affected public opinion. A poll last month for the Climate Institute, a Sydney research body, found that 77% of people worried about climate change; roughly the same share thought the Liberal Party should back the legislation. Mr Rudd is not due to face an election until late 2010. If the Senate overturns his bill later this month, he can reintroduce it after three months, then call an early election if it suffers the same fate again. That would be a big gamble. But having made an attack on global warming a central feature of his first term, it is one he may be willing to risk.","Plans for a carbon - emissions trading scheme may bring an early election 
 WAITING for the perfect wave , surf - riders at Newcastle seem oblivious to the cargo ships just beyond . A dozen are queuing to load coal from the Hunter Valley , one of Australia 's biggest coal - mining regions . The black stuff pouring through Newcastle 's port is one of Australia 's economic linchpins , making it the world 's biggest coal - exporter . As Kevin Rudd tries to push through legislation to deal with global warming , coal is also one of Kevin Rudd's headaches . Opposition to Kevin Rudd's plans is now so entrenched in parliament that Kevin Rudd is contemplating calling an early election . 
 Australia 's first coal was mined at Newcastle in 1797 , less than a decade after Europeans began to settle . Australians ever since have enjoyed cheap power from this dirty source of carbon - dioxide , the main culprit of global warming . Coal generates about 83 % of the country 's electricity , and even more in New South Wales , the most populous state . Kevin Rudd wants parliament this month to approve a scheme that would change the way Australians use energy , helping to give the country credibility at the global climate conference in Copenhagen in December . 
 Kevin Rudd has saddled Greg Combet , a minister and former union leader , with the task of talking the coal industry into accepting it . The industry complains the scheme 's costs will mean countries such as Indonesia will be able to undercut Australia in global coal markets . Mr Combet argues , nonetheless , that Australia 's role as one of the world 's biggest emitters , thanks largely to its coal - dependence , imposes a responsibility to help persuade developing countries to change their ways , too , and that Australia has to "" get stuck into this "" . Not everyone agrees .

BELYING its name, Harris Park is neither leafy nor green. It is a gritty western Sydney suburb, where Indian students have recently taken to the streets in protest against some of the worst ethnic-based attacks Australia has seen. As young Indian men gather by the local railway station, police converge further down the street and arrest two non-Indians. Asked about the wave of violence against their community, two Indians lower their voices. ""Lebanese,"" says one. Others wonder if the answer may be more complicated.
The violence sprang to public notice when two Indian men were attacked with screwdrivers in Melbourne last month. One was robbed. Both ended up in hospital. A demonstration of about 2,000 Indian students in Melbourne called for stronger police action. They claimed the attacks fitted into a wider pattern of violence over the past year against Indians in Australia. The Melbourne attacks came as a firebomb was hurled in Harris Park through the window of a house where young Indians lived. One suffered bad burns. On June 8th two more Indians were attacked near a Harris Park restaurant, where Indian community leaders had gathered, prompting two successive nights of demonstrations in the suburb. The Indian press accused Australia of racism. Amitabh Bachchan, a Bollywood superstar, refused an honorary doctorate from a university in Brisbane.
Over the past 40 years Australia has received waves of immigrants from Vietnam, Lebanon and other parts of Asia and the Middle East. Most have settled peaceably. Indians are the latest to arrive. In the decade to 2006 the number of Australian residents born in India almost doubled. India was the third-fastest-growing source of immigrants, after New Zealand and China.
There has also been a big increase in students coming from India, especially in courses for skills where qualifications offer a fast track to permanent residency. Since 2006 Indian enrolments in such ""vocational"" courses jumped by 161%, reaching 52,000 last year. Many Indian students have fanned out from inner-city student quarters to private colleges in the suburbs, and to places like Harris Park where rents are cheaper, and crime rates higher. In recent years Indians have displaced Lebanese as the suburb's biggest ethnic group.
Initially, police said the motive for the glut of attacks on Indians was robbery: students going home from night jobs carrying money and mobile phones were ""soft"" targets. Later, they conceded that some attacks were race-based. Many Indian students privately blame Lebanese youths, who may well be jobless gang-members. But at Billu's Indian Eatery and Sweet House, a Harris Park gathering point, Aruna Chandrala, an Indian community leader, carefully avoids censure. ""It's a law-and-order issue,"" she says. ""The students are saying 'Enough is enough'.""
It has also become a diplomatic embarrassment for Australia, at a time when it has been seeking to boost relations with India to what Stephen Smith, Australia's foreign minister, calls ""the front rank of our international partnerships"". Kumari Selja, India's tourism minister, has cancelled a planned visit to Australia in July. And Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, has said he is ""appalled"" at the violence, calling some of it racially motivated. 
Kevin Rudd, his Australian counterpart, dismissed race as a motive, and called the violence ""just a regrettable fact of urban life"". About 20 Australians, he pointed out, had been assaulted or murdered in India over the past decade. That is a good debating point: but not one that will help persuade Indian parents that Australia is a safe place to send their children.","Thuggery mars a burgeoning friendship

SYMBOLICALLY and practically, steel plays a large role in China's rapidly industrialising economy, and the main steelmakers have direct ties to the government. So no one in the country was in any doubt that the spreading investigation into the steelmakers' negotiations with foreign iron-ore miners, beginning with the detention on July 5th of four executives of Rio Tinto, an Anglo-Australian firm, represented a drastic government intervention in the workings of business. Just how drastic, however, continues to surprise.
On July 15th an executive at Laiwu Iron & Steel was reported to have been detained, the second non-Rio employee to be brought in after the earlier detention of a manager from the Shougang Group. These are large companies, important in their own right, but the news of the two executives' fate was quickly topped by a report in the government-controlled China Daily, quoting an anonymous ""industry insider"" as saying that managers at all 16 of the country's big steel companies involved in the iron-ore negotiations had been bribed by Rio.
In the face of these reports the government itself has been almost silent, noting only that the Rio case is tied to ""state secrets"" and ""espionage"". It has not explained why apparently routine business dealings are being treated as a matter of national security. 
Rio, along with the other global iron-ore producers, has been in brutal price negotiations with China for many months, busting the deadlines for their completion. The detentions have done nothing to advance the negotiations, although some steelmakers are widely reported to have cracked and provisionally agreed to a cut in ore prices of only 33%. This is significantly less than they had sought, though it corresponds to prices that South Korean and Japanese mills had already agreed to.
The possible breakthrough followed reports that the ore producers had begun holding back deliveries to China. The delays in striking a deal had also caused a spike in ore prices on the spot market, benefiting Australian miners at the expense of the Chinese steelmakers.
The Chinese negotiators are known to have been deeply unhappy with the miners' proposed contract terms. But the use of spying charges in connection with what should be a purely commercial transaction has, given the opacity of the country's legal system, sent a shudder through foreign businesses operating in China. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, warned China's authorities that the move could injure their commercial relationships around the world. Besides making foreign firms think twice about investing, it could impede efforts by China's acquisitive resources companies to buy operations in other countries, by adding to foreigners' doubts about putting their industry in the hands of an opaque, quixotic government.
The Rio case comes on top of other, less publicised moves which involved bewildering use of the legal system and may also have been motivated by economic nationalism. In June three managers at Guangdong Development Bank in southern China were detained over unspecified matters. The bank is managed by Citigroup, which owns 20% of it. None of the employees was originally from Citi but one was the representative of China Life, also a large shareholder in the bank, and one of China's biggest companies.
The detentions were disclosed in mid-June, not long after the arrest of the mayor of Shenzhen, a fast-growing southern city, over allegations of corruption. More quietly, lawyers say there have been increasing threats of legal action or detentions tied to a number of property developments involving foreign firms there and in Tianjin, where another corruption investigation has been unfolding.
News of detentions often emerges, if at all, not from the authorities but from informal sources including the news media or family members. This only adds to suspicions about the true motives behind the investigations. One lawyer says his foreign clients are not waiting around for more information: they have begun asking to have their names removed from the boards of domestic Chinese operations, just in case they are next.","China's detention of Rio executives seems to be part of a worrying trend

He has a good chance, some time over the next year, of becoming prime minister, following in the trail of his liberal grandfather and firebrand father.
Segolene Royal, the French vice-president of the Socialist International (SI), also came to the Aegean with a success story of sorts, but it too was on a small scale. In the region of Poitou-Charentes, which she runs, the problem of voter apathy is being solved, she insisted, with newfangled experiments in grassroots democracy: for example, ""citizens' juries"" chosen by lot to monitor the work of local officials.
If the talk turned to town-hall matters, that was partly because, nationally, this is a bad moment for Ms Royal, whose party is in chaos. The picture is hardly more cheerful for much of Europe's moderate left, whether in power or in opposition. With the exception of Greece, the European elections in June were a disaster for social democratic parties. From France to Austria, centre-leftists failed to harness dislike of conservative incumbents. There was a swing against ruling socialists from Bulgaria (where they were ousted from national power in July) to Britain (whose prime minister, Gordon Brown, looks irredeemably unpopular). In Spain supporters of the ruling socialists tried hard to convince people that they were as upset as anybody about unemployment of nearly 20%, but voters still nudged to the right. 
Elsewhere in the world, the picture is more mixed. But in almost every democracy, politicians who style themselves progressive face a common set of problems, to do with shrinking treasuries, looming environmental challenges, general pessimism and the resurgence of nationalism.
There is a paradox here. In many ways, the centre-left should be making hay. Whatever problems he may face at home, Barack Obama has emboldened critics of the status quo--and made life harder for purist conservatives--across the world. Mr Obama has given heart to those who argue that democracy (as opposed to street protests or violence) can produce real change; and helped those on the left who still say that America, for all its recent flaws, can be a guarantor of democracy and freedom. 
Meanwhile the banking crisis and the global downturn have been seized on by the Cassandras (many of them worthy centre-leftists) who said, even at the height of the boom, that global capitalism might become an uncontrollable monster.
But many voters seem unconvinced by the efforts of the centre-left to cash in with told-you-so talk. In some cases, that is because the right has stolen their clothes by launching economic rescue packages, and joining the denunciation of wild ""Anglo-Saxon"" capitalism. France's conservative president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for one, has borrowed personnel as well as rhetoric and ideas from the left.
In several countries the centre-right has held together with a judicious mixture of talk about tough border controls and promises of economic regeneration. ""They sound just a little bit harder on immigration and voters get the hint,"" says Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank. The centre-left, by contrast, has haemorrhaged votes, as malcontents drift to various extremes, or into apathy. 
A Marxist moment
Indeed, if any group has been making told-you-so arguments with success, it is the radical foes of the system, including Marxists, who denounce their more cautious comrades for being complicit in the capitalist order. In Germany, for example, the far-left vote held up better than that of parties nearer the middle--though some thought it would do better still.
Admittedly, some of the travails of the European centre-left reflect problems that are peculiar to the old continent. Under parties of any stripe, Europe's relative weight in the world economy would be doomed to decline--along with its ability to fund welfare programmes whose roots go back to post-1945 reconstruction and the ideological contests of the cold war.
Australia's Kevin Rudd, whose Labor Party scored a landslide victory in 2007, is holding up in the opinion polls, despite the difficulty of keeping promises and transforming the country's environmental posture in a deep recession. But Mr Rudd has advantages that his European counterparts lack: the cushion provided by a decade-long boom, and by signs that China--which buys Australia's commodities--is rapidly emerging from the downturn. He is promising a return to fiscal caution once his stimulus has helped the economy.
In Latin America, meanwhile, the centre-left is riding out the recession with comparative success. Take Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose working-class origins and pragmatic policies are still a winning mixture. He has managed to convince his compatriots that the recession was thrust upon the region from outside: it is, as he puts it, the fault of ""blonde, blue-eyed"" bankers from the north.
And in Latin America the centre-left has reaped some benefit from stimulus packages designed to protect jobs. In Chile--homeland of the Socialist International's secretary-general, Luis Ayala--such measures have boosted the popularity of the ruling coalition, three of whose constituents are members of the SI. The centre-left is now tipped to win a forthcoming presidential election, mainly because voters feel the need to protect the poor. For similar reasons, Uruguay's ruling left-of-centre coalition looks set to retain power in an electoral contest this autumn. And in Mexico's recent legislative election, it was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, a lumbering titan of the centre-left, that gained at the expense of the ruling conservatives, not parties of a more radical stripe.
At the same time, Latin America's far left seems a less attractive option for people hard hit by recession. More than in Western Europe, voters there have experience of far-leftist experiments--and their results. Administrations of a deep-red hue are now in power in a few countries, and their economies are in some ways doing worse than those of their neighbours. The red-hot ""21st-century socialism"" of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez has been obliged to cool down by sagging world energy prices. In Argentina's mid-term election, in June, the populist government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner lost its parliamentary majority.
True, there is one country where a centre-leftist leader is struggling under the impact of the recession, and under threat from radicals--Peru. But even there, ultra-leftism is not in the ascendant: the main radical contender for the 2011 election, Ollanta Humala, has tried to portray himself as a moderate and stressed his differences with the fiery Mr Chavez. Is green the new colour?
Both in the commodity-rich economies of the South, and in the tired old industrial societies of the North, a common dilemma--and perhaps, opportunity--for moderate leftists is posed by the environment.
Especially in Europe, centre-leftist politics and concern for the planet have almost blended into a single, warm and sometimes fuzzy discourse. Mr Papandreou, for one, expects a full merger. He wants to add environmentalism to the SI's core ideals of democracy and social justice. At home, he has taken risks in defence of that idea, by recruiting to his party a young independent green, Kriton Arsenis, whose campaign against construction on Aegean islands had threatened vested interests, including pro-Socialist ones.
But elsewhere, the terms of a political marriage between social democracy and greenery look uncertain. Many eyes are on Germany, where the Social Democratic Party (SPD)--now sharing power with the centre-right--did appallingly in the Euro-elections, with a record low of 21%, even as the Green vote held steady at 12%.
What does this portend for Germany's general election on September 27th? On the face of things, the only possibility of a left-of-centre government lies in a new ""red-green"" coalition, like the one that held power from 1998 to 2005, but with the greens dictating more of the terms.
A Green legislator, Kerstin Andreae, says the SPD is paying the price for internal strife and a lack of convincing leadership. The centre-left is still seen as the tree-huggers' natural partner. Recent German polls have sent a different message, however: that some voters like the idea of a more improbable alliance of greens and centre-rightists, a so-called black-green alliance of the kind that now has power in Hamburg.
Could it happen nationally? Ms Andreae notes that there are big gaps between her party and Germany's Christian Democrats (over nuclear power, say)--but she concedes that they have moved nearer the centre and ""we have hopes for them."" The only thing her party has ruled out is a ""Jamaica"" (green-black-yellow) deal with Christian Democrats and the liberal Free Democrats, in which the Greens would represent a lone non-establishment voice.
If Europe's premier green party made a deal with the centre-right, that might leave the centre-left feeling lonelier than ever. But recent events in Ireland (where centre-rightists and environmentalists have been sharing power) contain some sobering lessons for anybody contemplating such a bargain. In the European elections, both parts of the ruling coalition were soundly thrashed by recession-weary voters, especially the Greens.
Still, even in Ireland, centre-leftists would be wrong to see the environmentalists as tame fellow-travellers, easy to co-opt because they have nowhere else to go. Whichever partners they choose, green-minded people will have their own ideas.
Take Nessa Childers, an Irish Labour Euro-MP who was formerly a local Green politician. She, at least, is not about to convert to dogmatic leftism. ""The old left-right divide has ceased to reflect the choices people have in their lives,"" she says. Instead, she hopes her new colleagues will wrestle harder with the meaning of ""sustainable policies--for the fabric of society as well as for the planet."" Another good topic for a summer symposium.

AT FIRST glance it looked as if Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's opposition leader, had fired a deadly bolt at Kevin Rudd, the prime minister. In blocking the government's legislation on climate change, Mr Turnbull seemed to thwart the prime minister on the issue he has made his signature since leading the Labor Party to power in 2007. Mr Rudd has wanted the scheme, which is to set targets for Australia's carbon-emissions reductions, ready for December's climate conference in Copenhagen. But Mr Turnbull might have thrown a boomerang, making him victim of his own attack.
Mr Turnbull is a lustrous figure in Australian politics. Having entered parliament only in 2004, less than a year ago he took over the leadership of the conservative Liberal Party. He promised to shift the opposition's main party back towards the centre, after more than a decade tacking to the right under John Howard. An ex-journalist and lawyer, who made a fortune in Sydney's business world, Mr Turnbull once led Australia's republican movement. But politics has dulled his sparkle. A poll released on August 10th showed only 26% of voters approving of his performance, a plunge of 18 points since mid-June. Almost four times as many voters prefer Mr Rudd as prime minister. The figures reflect two setbacks, each partly of Mr Turnbull's own making.
In June, Mr Turnbull called for Mr Rudd's resignation, citing a leaked e-mail about a plan to help car-dealers stricken by the credit crunch. The e-mail purported to show that the prime minister's office had asked the Treasury to help a friend of Mr Rudd's. But on August 4th Godwin Grech, a Treasury official who testified about it to parliament, confessed that he had faked the document himself. Mr Grech, it emerged, had shown it on June 12th to Mr Turnbull, who then believed it to be real. Mr Grech has since been hospitalised for depression. A report by the federal auditor cleared Mr Rudd of any wrongdoing.
The ""OzCar affair"" has dimmed many Liberal parliamentarians' view of Mr Turnbull's judgment. A television profile aired on August 3rd hardly helped: by chance, the cameras were in his office the day the forgery was exposed. Peter Costello, a senior Liberal who once coveted Mr Turnbull's job, has groused about his lack of caution. Divisions have sharpened between the party's centrist wing and the Howard-era hardliners who resent Mr Turnbull's ego and his reformist instincts.
The same divisions have shaken Mr Turnbull's bid to shape the Liberals' approach to climate change. Like the government, he supports a cap-and-trade scheme, allowing polluters to buy and sell permits for their carbon emissions. Such legislation has already passed the parliament's lower house, in June. But conservatives contend the scheme will damage business and farming and send jobs offshore. Wilson Tuckey, one of them, accuses Mr Turnbull of ""inexperience and arrogance"".
To placate them, Mr Turnbull committed his coalition to voting against the bill when it came before the upper house, on August 13th. This aligned the Liberals with the Greens, who think the legislation too weak, and denied it a majority. The government can reintroduce the bill later this year, then call a general election if it is defeated a second time. Given his coalition's disastrous polling, Mr Turnbull is desperate to avoid that. He says he will negotiate amendments with the government when the legislation returns in November. Even if Mr Rudd's scheme survives then, there is no guarantee that Mr Turnbull's leadership will be so lucky.","The Liberal leader botches a tricky hand

WHEN Kevin Rudd, Australia's Mandarin-speaking prime minister, came to power in late 2007 the country's relations with China seemed poised to improve. But the love-in has failed to happen. This week Australia's government announced that China had cancelled a visit by He Yafei, a foreign-affairs minister, earlier this month. He was to attend a summit of Pacific island leaders, at which Mr Rudd hoped to discuss his plan for a new Asia-Pacific regional body involving China. 
The snub was the latest setback in a relationship undergoing strains on several fronts. Australia's commercial relations with its biggest trading partner tend to collide with China's unhappiness over its political stance, especially over human rights. The cancelled ministerial visit was a response to a decision to allow Rebiya Kadeer, an exiled activist from China's ethnic Uighurs, to visit Australia. 
China has accused Ms Kadeer of inciting riots involving Uighur and Han Chinese last month. Her visit was to attend the opening of an Australian film about her at the Melbourne Film Festival. The organisers ignored pressure from Chinese officials to cancel the screening, moving it instead to a larger venue when publicity over the row fuelled demand. China reportedly threatened Melbourne's mayor with ending a sister-city relationship with Tianjin. It also unsuccessfully leant on the National Press Club in Canberra to cancel an invitation to Ms Kadeer to speak there.
Yet this week another Australian minister was in Beijing for the signing of a deal under which China will buy liquefied natural gas worth A$50 billion ($41 billion) from Gorgon, off Western Australia's coast. The deal between PetroChina, a state-controlled company, and Exxon Mobil is reckoned to be Australia's biggest-ever trade contract. There are hopes that China might be signalling that commercial pragmatism will dictate relations with Australia.
It is proving hard, however, to disentangle the commercial from the political. In June China was upset by what it saw as a threat to its interests when Rio Tinto, an Anglo-Australian mining giant, walked away from an offer by Chinalco, a state-run aluminium firm, to pay $19.5 billion to double its stake in the firm. Instead, Rio struck a deal with BHP Billiton, its main competitor, to exploit jointly the vast iron-ore deposits of Western Australia's Pilbara region. Already, China is Australia's biggest market for iron ore, to fuel its industrial expansion. 
Australians mainly welcomed the collapse of the Chinalco deal, amid perceptions that China wanted to use its economic power to exert pressure on prices of one of the country's most lucrative resources. Scepticism towards China in Australia hardened in July after the detention of Stern Hu, an Australian who heads Rio's iron-ore operations in China, and three colleagues. Initially accused of stealing state secrets, seemingly to help Rio's bargaining position in the annual benchmark pricing negotiations for iron ore, Mr Hu and some colleagues were eventually charged this month with the lesser offences of commercial espionage and taking bribes.
Reflecting his own background as a diplomat in China, Mr Rudd has taken a low-key approach to resolving the affair of Mr Hu. An opinion poll published this week found that 58% of Australians approved of Mr Rudd's handling of China. But China's recent tough tactics may have done little to reassure Australians about the intentions of their giant trading partner. China Daily, a state-run newspaper, this week accused Australia of being ""the champion leader of anti-China chorus"". That chorus is unlikely to pipe down.

China Daily , a state - run newspaper , this week accused Australia of being "" the champion leader of anti - China chorus "" . That chorus is unlikely to pipe down .

THE most talked-about book in Australia at present is ""The Slap"", a novel by Christos Tsiolkas, a Greek-Australian author, about the consequences of the disciplining of a child at a suburban barbecue by someone other than his parents. Its setting is emphatically antipodean and so, too, are its voices: eight characters drawn from Melbourne's polyglot middle classes. It is precisely the kind of work that the Australian publishing industry claims will be endangered by what, in literary circles at least, is Australia's most talked-about policy proposal: a recommendation being considered by the government to eliminate ""territorial copyright"". 
Under Australia's copyright laws, local publishers have 30 days to produce their own editions of books published elsewhere. If they do so, local bookstores must sell those, rather than foreign ones. But local editions, says the Productivity Commission, the government's economic think-tank, are about 35% more expensive than foreign ones. Consumers end up bearing this extra cost. The novels of Peter Carey, the country's most acclaimed contemporary author, are cheaper in America (where he now lives) than in Australia, laments the Productivity Commission. It is therefore urging the government to amend the law.
Yet the opponents of the proposal--a ""Who's Who"" of Australian literature--argue that novelists like Mr Carey would never have been published had it not been for territorial copyright. As the Booker-prize-winning novelist himself pointed out to the Productivity Commission, ""My writing life has been made possible by the Australian publishers who accepted my work when it was rejected in London and New York, who believed in a literature that would define Australia for Australians and represent us to the world."" The flourishing publishing industry makes no apology for resorting to this kind of cultural nationalism. It fears a return to the days when Australia was a ""colonial depot"" for unsold books from Britain. Australian publishers could ""simply become distributors in a global supply chain"", according to Mr Carey.
In response, the Productivity Commission has suggested that the young, aspiring Peter Careys of the future might be succoured by government grants. It notes, as well, that territorial copyright protects all titles equally, and thus does not differentiate between books of high cultural value and those of questionable worth.
The Coalition for Cheaper Books may lack Mr Carey's erudition, but it does have a ringing slogan: ""Wider reading through cheaper books"". Set up by Dymocks, a leading bookstore chain, and the big supermarkets, the coalition also has commercial and political clout. It claims that territorial copyright is not only anachronistic but unsustainable in the internet age. After all, many Australians already bypass the restrictions on foreign editions by importing books themselves, using online stores such as Amazon. Even with the shipping costs to faraway Australia, that is often cheaper than buying locally.
Ultimately the decision rests with Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, a bookish type who famously penned a 7,000-word essay for a highbrow magazine, the Monthly, warning against ""free-market fundamentalism"" and ""extreme capitalism"". Then again, he also likes to rail against high prices with populist fervour.
Most of the English-speaking world, including America, Britain and Canada, still retains territorial copyright. The main exception is New Zealand, which gave it up in 1998. Different studies have pointed to different effects, from the earlier release of new titles to a flood of cheap foreign children's books. In 2004 a report found that local publishers were producing a narrower range of titles, with an emphasis on rugby and images of New Zealand's idyllic countryside. That is exactly the sort of blow predicted by authors and publishers of books like the ""The Slap"".

THE story of the ""Balibo Five"" is still a dark spot for relations between Australia and Indonesia. How five Australia-based television journalists died 34 years ago, trying to film Indonesia's invasion of the then Portuguese colony of East Timor, remains officially unresolved. A new film, shown this week in Dili, has reignited the affair in Australia.
The journalists perished in the remote village of Balibo, near the Indonesian border, in October 1975; their bodies were later burned. Indonesia has always claimed they died in crossfire between its soldiers and pro-independence fighters. Despite campaigns by the journalists' families, Australia has never challenged this version, as it has focused on building relations with Indonesia.
The first break in this official silence came only two years ago. A coroner in New South Wales found the journalists were killed by Indonesian special-forces soldiers under orders from Captain Yunus Yosfiah, their commander, to stop them disclosing Indonesia's attack on Balibo. Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, responded then (when he was opposition leader) that ""those responsible should be held to account"". The coroner's report still sits with the police.
""Balibo"" painstakingly reconstructs the journalists' deaths. The film tells the story through the figure of Roger East, a sixth journalist, who set out to discover what happened to them, and who was shot dead himself when Indonesian forces reached Dili. The young journalists had been tempting fate in a region then shut out of communication. Greg Shackleton, one of the five, scrawled an Australian flag on a Balibo wall in a forlorn bid for safety as the Indonesians approached. Robert Connolly, the film's director, says he wanted to show not just the injustice in the deaths of the journalists--and thousands of East Timorese--but ""how meaningless national identity becomes at a moment when order breaks down completely"".
Now that order is restored, Ben Saul, an international law expert, argues there is a case for pursuing the deaths of the Balibo Five as war crimes. Mr Connolly hopes Indonesia and Australia can be ""tough and rigorous"" about dealing with the truth at last. But with relations never better, and Indonesia still loth to investigate any of the abuses that took place under the long Suharto dictatorship that ended in 1998, the truth may remain buried.","Among so many dead in East Timor , a few now famous foreigners

THE past two years have rather obscured the charms of the free market. For those seeking to restore their faith, a trip to the Kashmir Valley provides some unlikely solace. The floating vegetable market that assembles at dawn on Dal Lake is perhaps the easiest market in the world to romanticise.
Shortly after the call to prayer sounds from the lakeshore shrine, farmers and traders cast off on narrow skiffs to truck, barter and exchange. Their boats bob and sway as bids and offers rise and fall. Sellers bump gently into buyers, putting a foot in the customer's boat to ensure that the deal does not drift away. Sprigs of mint, red coils of lotus root and bundles of knotted cabbage change hands for a few rupees, tossed from one boatman's lap to another. The terms of exchange float freely--and, best of all, the traders do not need bailing out.
The market, it is worth remembering, is just a form of human exchange. ""To be generically against markets would be almost as odd as being generically against conversations between people,"" notes Amartya Sen, a Nobel prize-winning economist. The recent crisis was not a generic failure of markets but a specific failure of finance. The meltdown did no discredit to markets that exchange goods and services as opposed to assets and securities. On Dal Lake, the traders know what they are getting; a buyer picks out the bad beans and tosses them overboard before money changes hands. And the goods are perishable, leaving little time for speculation.
Nonetheless, for many observers the retreat of Anglo-Saxon liberalism is one of the most telling parts of the new normal. Pimco's Mr El-Erian argues that the crisis has broken the spell of the ""mystical Anglo-Saxon model of liberalisation and deregulation"". Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, recently heralded the overthrow of neoliberalism, ""the economic orthodoxy of our time"". In the run-up to Japan's recent election, Yukio Hatoyama, the victorious candidate for prime minister, campaigned against ""unrestrained market fundamentalism"".
Liberal reforms designed to increase the supply-side capacity of an economy, for example by removing barriers to entry, lose some of their urgency when the economy is too weak to achieve the potential it already has. And when financial markets are subdued, a reforming policymaker cannot count on a stockmarket rally to reward him. 
But in most industries the underlying logic of the Anglo-Saxon model is no more or less obvious today than it was two years ago. No one who believed, before the crisis, that manufacturing, telecommunications or steelmaking was the private sector's job should have changed their mind since. It is the Anglo-Saxon model of deregulated and liberalised finance that has lost its mystique. Bunches of swaps, sprigs of auction-rate securities and bundles of subprime loans--these are perhaps the hardest markets in the world to romanticise. Arm's-length or hands-on?
In the Anglo-Saxon model deep capital markets compete with banks, which also compete vigorously with each other. Transactions are carried out at arm's length, on the basis of public information, at competitive prices, and under contracts enforceable by third parties. 
Before the crisis this model was gradually gaining ground. Subir Lall of the IMF and his colleagues have documented the growth in ""arm's-length"" finance in countries traditionally dominated by hands-on banks, such as Germany and France. Ten years ago, in the wake of Japan's stagnation and the Asian financial crisis, Mr Rajan and Mr Zingales of the University of Chicago noted the ""slow but steady ascendance of the public markets"" and wondered if it heralded ""the eventual supremacy of the arm's-length, market-based, Anglo-Saxon system"".
That advance has dramatically reversed in the past two years (see chart 6). In the crisis, companies that had relied on selling marketable securities to raise working capital turned in desperation to their banks instead, tapping pre-arranged credit lines to keep afloat. At the same time many off-balance-sheet investment vehicles, supposedly at arm's length from the banks that sponsored them, quickly returned to their sponsors' bosoms when the markets failed to fund them. 
The traditional alternative to arm's-length finance is a more intimate system dominated by banks that maintain long-term relationships with their borrowers. In Japan, for example, companies traditionally turn to the same one or two banks for their financing. In Germany banks traditionally have block shareholdings in the companies they serve and put representatives on their boards. 
This clubbier finance offers three important advantages over the stand-offish Anglo-Saxon model. The banks know their customers better; they can smooth their lending to them during periods of misfortune; and they have ""skin in the game"", retaining some responsibility for the loans they extend.
But a financial system based on stable relationships has its own drawbacks. In such a system a small cluster of banks comes to a committee decision on whether a venture is worth backing or not. The process requires bankers ""to submerge their disagreements and accept a compromise"", as Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale point out in their book, ""Comparing Financial Systems"". 
The market, on the other hand, ""allows investors to agree to disagree"". Thousands can place their bets, based on their own hunches and insights. Markets, therefore, have an edge whenever diversity of opinion matters. When it comes to financing new technologies or fresh ideas, it is often better to leave the job to the ""wisdom of crowds"" (the title of a book on markets by James Surowiecki) than to the conventional wisdom of loan officers in a bank.
Mr Lall of the IMF and his co-authors have tried to show this empirically by looking at the industries that contributed the most to world growth from 1980 to 2001. Countries that specialised in those industries in 1980 duly prospered over the subsequent 20 years. Countries that had the ""wrong"" industrial mix did less well. But the researchers found that starting out with the wrong industries was less of a problem for countries with arm's-length financial systems. Mr Lall reckons these systems do a better job of reallocating resources from declining to growing sectors. The worst of both worlds
The markets most damaged by the crisis are those for securitised assets. Securitisation is supposed to turn a long-term banking relationship, ie, a loan, into an arm's-length transaction, the sale and purchase of a security backed by loans. But it ended up caught halfway between the two. Banks, as many commentators have noted, kept a surprising share of subprime securities on their balance-sheets rather than selling them on. According to a study by Hyun Shin of Princeton University and his co-authors, they suffered over 30% of the subprime losses in 2008.
This cross-bred model provided none of the advantages of arm's-length securitisation, which was supposed to move default risk away from the banking system, spreading it widely to those best placed to bear it. Nor did the model provide any of the advantages of ""intimate finance"". The banks had no relationship with the mortgage-holders or companies from whose borrowings their mincemeat securities were reconstituted.
Why did banks keep these securities, rather than sell them on? Mr Shin argues that banks held mortgage-backed securities so that they could borrow against them. The demand for securitised assets was, in essence, a demand for leverage. 
If banks could not borrow from pension funds or other investors, they turned to other banks instead. In this way they wove a cat's cradle of cross-claims on each other: one bank's liability was another bank's asset. This made the banking system more fragile, not less. If one bank took the precaution of trimming its assets, it deprived another bank of funding. Prudence in one institution might then inspire panic in another. Low-octane fuel
The banks' freedom to borrow will be regulated more tightly in the new normal. They will be required to hold more capital ""once recovery is assured"", the G20 finance ministers and central bankers said in September. Mr Shin argues that these capital requirements should tighten in booms, when banks become more eager to borrow, and ease in busts. 
Regulators in Europe and America may also oblige the creators of these securities to hold on to 5% of the value of the assets they distribute to others. Five per cent does not sound like much, but in 2007 they held an average of just 1.5%, according to the IMF's latest Global Financial Stability Report. The fund's calculations suggest that a 5% requirement would be enough to close some securitisation markets for good.
For its part, the IMF does not want to see securitisation return to its ""high-octane levels"" of 2005-07. But it nonetheless thinks regulators should mend securitisation, not end it. The banks, it points out, cannot fill the lending gap left by these markets. And the securities the banks now borrow against will need replacing with fresh ones as they mature. ""In light of the current constraints on lending capacity, restarting securitisation could help get credit growth moving again,"" it notes.
The IMF is right that the securitisation market's misery is hurting credit and therefore demand. But it need not do lasting damage to the economy's longer-run prospects. These markets are a dominant provider of mortgage finance and an important source of car loans and consumer credit. That is a good thing, as far as it goes. But home- and car-ownership are hardly the engines of economic growth. Indeed, the acceleration of credit during the securitisation era was not matched by an acceleration in economic output.
In the long run growth depends on replacing obsolete methods of production with better ones, and supplanting old industries with new ones. Repackaging subprime mortgages does not further that cause, but other arm's-length markets do. As Messrs Allen and Gale note, the Anglo-Saxon stockmarkets have been conspicuously successful at sponsoring new industries and reallocating resources to them. For all its excesses and eccentricities, these feats of economic reinvention are the Anglo-Saxon model's saving grace--and they remain vital to the process of industrial renewal, the subject of the next article.","The Anglo-Saxon model has taken a knock

WHEN Kevin Rudd became Australia's prime minister almost two years ago, many thought they had heard the last loud discords about asylum-seekers landing on Australia's northern shores. But a recent increase in numbers of boat people has reignited the issue. This is straining Mr Rudd's pledge to soften the former conservative government's hard edge towards asylum-seekers. It is also testing Australia's relations with Indonesia.
In Jakarta this week for the inauguration of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Mr Rudd persuaded Indonesia's president to accept 78 Sri Lankans for processing in the country. Australian authorities had rescued them from a boat between Sumatra and Christmas Island, an Australian territory. A week earlier, to oblige Mr Rudd, Indonesia's navy intercepted a boat with 250-odd Sri Lankans heading for Australia. Now moored in West Java, its passengers are refusing to disembark. Australia has now offered Indonesia more help to deal with boat people.
In 2001 John Howard, Mr Rudd's predecessor, exploited public anxieties about boat people when he ordered troops to board a Norwegian freighter, the Tampa, to stop it bringing 430 rescued asylum-seekers to Australia.

Now in opposition, Mr Howard's old political allies are shrilly blaming Mr Rudd for the boats' reappearance. A year ago only about 200 people were being held in immigration detention centres. By early this month there were 1,270, most on Christmas Island, where boat people are processed. Yet the rise also coincides with a growth of people fleeing conflicts in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, which account for almost three-quarters of Australia's detainees. And the numbers are tiny compared with the 14,000 ""unlawful non-citizens"" who, authorities say, melted into Australia in 2007-08 after arriving by air and overstaying visas.
Nonetheless, Mr Rudd's approaches to Indonesia have a populist impulse: the fears, long embedded in the Australian psyche, of swarms of arrivals in the country's north. An opinion poll this month by the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think-tank, found 76% of people are concerned about asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat.
Relations with Indonesia have rarely been better. But there is another sensitive issue: Australian police's recent decision to reopen the case of the ""Balibo Five"", Australia-based journalists whom Indonesian troops murdered during their invasion of East Timor 34 years ago.

 WHEN Kevin Rudd became Australia 's prime minister almost two years ago , many thought they had heard the last loud discords about asylum - seekers landing on Australia 's northern shores . But a recent increase in numbers of boat people has reignited the issue . This is straining Kevin Rudd's pledge to soften the former conservative government 's hard edge towards asylum - seekers . It is also testing Australia 's relations with Indonesia . 
 In Jakarta this week for the inauguration of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , Kevin Rudd persuaded Indonesia 's president to accept 78 Sri Lankans for processing in the country . Australian authorities had rescued them from a boat between Sumatra and Christmas Island , an Australian territory . A week earlier , to oblige Kevin Rudd , Indonesia 's navy intercepted a boat with 250 - odd Sri Lankans heading for Australia . Now moored in West Java , its passengers are refusing to disembark . Australia has now offered Indonesia more help to deal with boat people . 
 In 2001 John Howard , Kevin Rudd's predecessor , exploited public anxieties about boat people when he ordered troops to board a Norwegian freighter , the Tampa , to stop it bringing 430 rescued asylum - seekers to Australia . His Labor government last year ditched other harsh Howard measures . Kevin Rudd's mantra is "" tough but humane "" .

AS USUAL at such shindigs, lofty dreams of pan-Asian economic integration got a good airing at a regional leaders' summit held in Thailand on October 25th. Buoyed by signs of recovery in recession-bound countries, and unbroken expansion in China, India and Indonesia, leaders spoke glowingly of a free-trade zone that would link the world's most dynamic economies. Yukio Hatoyama, prime minister of Japan, the region's largest economy, if one of its worst-performing, said such a zone should have a common currency and aspire to ""lead the world"". Not to be outdone, Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, proposed a pan-Pacific economic community that would include America and collaborate on security. 
Lest anyone get too carried away, officials were on hand to caution that such grand plans would not happen overnight. Mr Hatoyama, who is trying to give Japan a more prominent role in Asia without jeopardising its security guarantee from America, described his proposal as a ""medium-term objective"". Indeed, talk of an East Asian community, with perhaps even a single currency, is nothing new. But the chatter has grown louder since America blundered into a financial crisis that sapped its ability to act as the motor for global growth. As Abhisit Vejjajiva, Thailand's prime minister, put it, the old model of satisfying Western consumers ""will no longer serve"" the region. 
There is tremendous scope for Asian countries to boost intra-regional trade and investment. On trade it is already happening: intra-East Asian trade flows rose to 42% of total trade in 2008, up from 32% in 1990, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). But much of this is in commodities and semi-finished goods, with America, Japan or Europe as the final destination. China is the source of much of this growth, but it is rarely the end-consumer. Instead, it remains a competitor to other developing Asian countries for rich-world markets. 
The ten-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which played host to the summit, likes to tout its own efforts to build a European-style single market of over 500m people. The first phase of a free-trade zone is due to take full effect on January 1st. Six members have already cut tariffs on manufactured goods, though not on farm produce. ASEAN has also been busy signing free-trade pacts with regional powerhouses such as China and India. These could become the basis of a pan-Asian trade bloc, reckons Kiat Sittheeamorn, Thailand's chief trade negotiator. 
But these agreements rarely add up to much, as they must satisfy all ASEAN members, some of which already have their own bilateral deals with the third party. The end result is yet another set of rules for importers to work out, says Jayant Menon, an economist for the ADB. He says ASEAN countries deserve praise for cutting tariffs in a non-discriminatory way (ie, on goods produced both inside and outside ASEAN). Executives complain, though, that red tape and other non-tariff barriers are a far bigger hurdle. ASEAN's nascent free-trade zone also excludes services, and tiptoes around labour mobility. 
A deeper problem for ASEAN is its cohesion and credibility. It at last has a legal charter, but is bound by a strict policy of non-interference that prevents any version of Europe's pooled sovereignty. It began as a cold-war security alliance without a common vision. Four decades on, it has yet to find one. Political, cultural and economic disparities loom large. Even leaving aside the perennial distraction of Myanmar, a repressive military dictatorship that Western allies find hard to sit down with, mutual mistrust and outright hostility between countries make a mockery of ASEAN's encomiums on unity. They also bode poorly for the resolution of disputes in a closer economic union. Bad blood
The latest spat is between Thailand and Cambodia, whose prime minister, Hun Sen, went out of his way to antagonise the summit's host, Mr Abhisit. Over the past year, the two countries' armies have clashed several times over a disputed border temple. Naturally, this is never discussed by ASEAN, lest it upset either side. A new row is over Thailand's former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile and is wanted at home on a criminal conviction. Hun Sen told reporters at the summit that his ""old friend"" Mr Thaksin was welcome to seek asylum in Cambodia and to be his economic adviser. 
Thai diplomats fumed that arrest and extradition would be the right way to treat a fugitive. But that seems unlikely after Hun Sen's extraordinary show of support. By taking sides in Thailand's politics, Cambodia's leader ""went for the jugular"", says Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a Thai political scientist. Sensibly, Mr Abhisit has not risen to the bait, though the anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy this week staged a small protest outside Cambodia's embassy in Bangkok. The group has previously stirred trouble at the border, where Hun Sen has threatened to shoot any Thai trespassers. In 2003 anti-Thai riots swept Cambodia's capital over a rumoured nationalist slight by a Thai actress. Relations today are hardly much better. So much for ASEAN brotherhood. 
None of which need stop South-East Asian countries from trying to promote cross-border economic co-operation. After more than a decade in the works, a currency-swap scheme among Asian central banks is beginning to look like a facility that might conceivably be used. But ASEAN looks too weak and divided to manage faster and deeper regional integration. Indeed, four leaders skipped the summit's opening ceremony. No wonder, then, that ASEAN's biggest member, Indonesia, which also happens to be its most vibrant democracy, seems to set greater store by its seat at the G20 table.

AGED 25 and armed with a master's degree in water management, Andrew Reeves has the very mix of youth and green-mindedness that many governments claim to need. Yet when he attended a Canadian government job fair in Toronto this autumn, he left after 20 minutes without handing out a single resume.
He queued in front of a booth for the Canadian natural-resources ministry, only to be told that information on openings was best found on the ministry's website. ""I'd have preferred to do the whole thing by e-mail,"" he grumbles. Such was his frustration that he settled instead for a small non-profit group specialised in recycling.
At a time when many administrations in the rich world face a looming talent shortage, because a huge cohort of civil servants is about to retire, anyone would think that governments would be trying harder, and in cleverer ways, to scoop up bright students now leaving college.
It is not simply a matter of replacing one set of mandarins with another: in an age when most policy issues (from climate change to migration) cut across ministries and state boundaries, the civil servants of tomorrow will have to be lateral thinkers, not pen-pushers. And for better or worse, the outcome of the global recession will be closer regulation of the world's economic and financial systems, for years to come.
Especially in the English-speaking world, governments say they are trying hard to bring some private-sector pizzazz to all aspects of public administration, including recruitment. Among the legacies of Tony Blair's term as prime minister of Britain is the idea that the ""services delivered"" by government can be monitored almost as precisely as a firm's profits. 
And Britain's civil service got a jolt three years ago when Gill Rider--a partner in Accenture, a management consultancy--was given a wide-ranging brief to shake up the way personnel were used and rewarded. The results have been watched carefully in places like Canada, Australia and Ireland. Civil-service reforms can work best in smallish territories--Denmark, Finland, Scotland, Wales, the Canadian provinces--says Tony Dean, a British-born Canadian who has switched from being a bureaucrat to studying bureaucracy. (Outside the English-speaking, Nordic and Teutonic worlds, one of the few countries often cited as a model for administrative reform is Singapore, which pays its bureaucrats well so as to stem corruption.)
However well-planned, internal reforms may not be enough to solve the basic problem--common to most of the leading industrial democracies--of competing for talent with commerce and voluntary groups, and then retaining the loyalty of a fickle, sceptical generation. ""If we have any energy left after the trials of a competitive American college, we turn to private corporations if we have debt to repay, and to the non-profit sector if we want to make the world better,"" says Robert Ochshorn, who has just graduated in computer sciences from Cornell University. 
In simple numerical terms, the personnel gap opening up is vast. A report by the OECD, a rich-countries' club, found that in 13 of the member countries surveyed, at least 30% of central-government workers were 50 years of age or older. Generous early-retirement provisions mean that many will leave their posts fairly soon.
To replace them, governments will have to offer something more than the steady life that attracted the older caste of mandarins. ""We're a squirmy generation,"" admits Tyler Hunt, a University of Toronto student who is about to start looking for work. ""The idea of settling into a job for 30 years just isn't appealing.""
Today's high-flyers want multi-disciplinary careers, the ability to rise as high and fast as their talents allow, and the freedom to move in and out of government work, says Linda Bilmes, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School and co-author (with Scott Gould) of a book* that predicts a crisis in America's public service.
Even those keenest on working for the nation may find their loyalty tested, she notes. A State Department officer who masters a hard language may get dozens of job offers, from private firms or global institutions. The ""stove-piped"" structure of government careers in most OECD countries takes little account of these new realities; talent that leaves is unlikely to return.
In any case, before you can think of retaining the best employees, you have to get them in the door. In the United States, the complexity of recruitment deters eager youngsters. As Ms Bilmes points out, advertisements even for modest posts are ""filled with jargon, acronyms and unexplained requirements"" such as ""eligibility under 5 CFR 330.60 (b)"".
In the short term, the recession will certainly increase the number of graduates who are willing to surmount these hurdles. But in the contest for really marketable skills, government will often be at a disadvantage. For a young biochemist, working for a big pharmaceutical firm is far more tempting than government research. It is the same for graduates trained in intellectual-property law or telecoms.
On the lowest rungs of the career ladder, salaries in America's public sector can be quite competitive with the private sector; but at the highest levels, the differential is vast. In the private sector, and above all in finance, successful types earn many times more than public servants with huge responsibilities. An added turn-off for would-be American bureaucrats is that top positions are often filled by political fiat, not merit. 
In many rich countries, there is a hint of desperation in the way some public employers try to present their work as glamorous. ""Did you know we have our own CSI [Crime Scene Investigation] team?"" asks the website of Ontario's government, citing an American television show. British Columbia stresses long holidays (time to hike and ski), while in Britain, potential mandarins are told of the heroic role they might play in a catastrophe.
In some rich democracies, the personnel problem is felt only in specific areas. In Australia, for example, the elite stream of civil servants still attracts brilliant applicants, but hiring accountants and IT specialists for lower positions is harder, says Peter Shergold, an ex-cabinet secretary. 
In his view, the public sector should be looking not just for high IQs but a new skill: that of negotiating with the many agencies (including non-profit and private bodies) to which government is being farmed out. Old, vertical bureaucracies are ill-adapted to this task; flexible youngsters will have to do better. For that reason, perhaps, Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, recently asked his top bureaucrat for a plan to shake up the entire civil service.
If there is one rich democracy where state service is revered, it is France. Competition to get into elite institutions like the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA, a springboard for bureaucrats and politicians) is still fiercely meritocratic. For the 2009 intake, 1,352 applicants took the exam for just 80 places. Government jobs are in huge demand. In 2007 roughly 178,000 aspirants took the exam for the highest of the three grades of civil servant, comprising just 24,000 jobs. Some 44% of the successful recruits were actually overqualified.
""As the French see it, joining the civil service is not generally considered a track like any other, but a decision to devote one's life to the public interest,"" purrs an official report. Some 70% of French respondents told Ipsos, a pollster, that the civil service had a good image, and they would like their children to join.
Still, there are signs, at least, of change in the process whereby alumni of the ENA move seamlessly into the senior ranks of administration. For one thing, enarques (as graduates of the school are called) are moving on from the civil service into top private-sector jobs, in banking and insurance; and (unlike two of his four predecessors) President Nicolas Sarkozy did not attend the school. Nor did most of his cabinet. In future, enarques will no longer be assigned to state jobs on the basis of their grades; they will apply in a more-or-less open procedure.
Even in mandarin-minded France, the problem of an ageing civil service is felt. In 2005 the average age of a civil servant was 42, three years more than the private-sector mean. Under a plan supposed to take effect by 2012, Mr Sarkozy wants to cut the total number of civil servants while hiking pay and incentives for those who stay.
There is also stiff competition for positions in the European Union bureaucracy, whose culture is heavily French. The hurdles are worth negotiating for anyone who likes the stimulation of a multilingual, multicultural environment, says Aurelien Juliard, a successful applicant for a recent batch of 200 posts. Some 19,000 hopefuls sat an exam, and were whittled down to 600; they then faced a second exam and an essay, on the basis of which 300 were summoned for an oral interrogation. The bureaucrats of Brussels do not enjoy the same public esteem as the sleek administrators of Paris, but they are well rewarded in other ways.
In places like Canada, where the need to hire and deploy government personnel in a more rational way is recognised in principle, at least, sensible changes have had unexpected results. Hiring for Canada's public sector has been decentralised, allowing those who are closest to the job to make the selection. And mobility within the civil service has increased, creating the sort of environment that young recruits want. But a report by the Public Service Commission of Canada, which oversees the hiring and welfare of 210,000 federal civil servants, has noted some drawbacks. Almost one-third of respondents to a survey said they had had three or more supervisors in the past three years; half told another survey that rapid staff turnover had caused problems.
Morale in any civil service, and its attractiveness to recruits, are also affected by factors unrelated to promotion ladders or pay-scales. The political mood, for example. In the view of Ms Bilmes, the malaise of America's bureaucracy reflects an overzealous response to Ronald Reagan's dictum: the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help.""
In the Obama era, things may be different--not just in the United States, but in democracies that emulate America. As 21-year-old Mr Ochshorn puts it, ""Our elected politicians long created an impression of government as stale and rife with bureaucracy...but my peers are proud of having elected Obama, and that has improved the image of government."" If hopes like that prove overblown, clever youngsters will not be slow to notice.

Under a plan supposed to take effect by 2012 , Mr Sarkozy wants to cut the total number of civil servants while hiking pay and incentives for those who stay . 
 There is also stiff competition for positions in the European Union bureaucracy , whose culture is heavily French . The hurdles are worth negotiating for anyone who likes the stimulation of a multilingual , multicultural environment , says Aurelien Juliard , a successful applicant for a recent batch of 200 posts . Some 19,000 hopefuls sat an exam , and were whittled down to 600 ; they then faced a second exam and an essay , on the basis of which 300 were summoned for an oral interrogation . The bureaucrats of Brussels do not enjoy the same public esteem as the sleek administrators of Paris , but they are well rewarded in other ways . 
 In places like Canada , where the need to hire and deploy government personnel in a more rational way is recognised in principle , at least , sensible changes have had unexpected results . Hiring for Canada 's public sector has been decentralised , allowing those who are closest to the job to make the selection . And mobility within the civil service has increased , creating the sort of environment that young recruits want . But a report by the Public Service Commission of Canada , which oversees the hiring and welfare of 210,000 federal civil servants , has noted some drawbacks . Almost one - third of respondents to a survey said they had had three or more supervisors in the past three years ; half told another survey that rapid staff turnover had caused problems . 
 Morale in any civil service , and its attractiveness to recruits , are also affected by factors unrelated to promotion ladders or pay - scales . The political mood , for example . In the view of Ms Bilmes , the malaise of America 's bureaucracy reflects an overzealous response to Ronald Reagan 's dictum : the nine most terrifying words in the English language are , "" I 'm from the government and I 'm here to help . "" 
 In the Obama era , things may be different -- not just in the United States , but in democracies that emulate America . As 21 - year - old Mr Ochshorn puts it , "" Our elected politicians long created an impression of government as stale and rife with bureaucracy ... but my peers are proud of having elected Obama , and that has improved the image of government . "" If hopes like that prove overblown , clever youngsters will not be slow to notice .

FIJI'S military strongman, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, has thumped down his fist. He will restore relations with Australia and New Zealand only in 2014, he says, having booted out their High Commissioners on November 4th. He justified the expulsions by saying the countries were interfering in his efforts to replace judges he sacked when he abrogated the constitution in April. 
This latest diplomatic crisis, as with previous such episodes, led to a ratcheting up of repression at home: Brij Lal, a persistent critic of the regime and a distinguished historian of the Indian diaspora, was taken to a military barracks, harassed and thrown out of the country. This week, the authorities started jamming anti-government bloggers, who have proliferated since the coup of December 2006. 
Mr Bainimarama's belligerence has divided the region. Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, gave warning that Fiji might spread its ""coup culture"" across the Pacific. Some Pacific island leaders, though, who think Australia and New Zealand are being overbearing, are more sympathetic to Fiji's coup leader.
But while he talks tough in the region, back home the commodore is in trouble. Fiji's economy is reeling. Sugar, its mainstay for over 100 years, has been devastated by big cuts in European Union preferential prices; the industry is failing to meet agreed shipments to the British company Tate & Lyle. Other export industries, including garments, bottled mineral water and gold, also face difficulties. Only tourism fared well in 2009, as Australians and New Zealanders stayed nearer home instead of going to Europe and America. The recent expulsions risk turning some of them away again.
Mr Bainimarama's political position is being eroded, too. In August, two of his rivals--once arch-adversaries--joined forces against him. They are Laisenia Qarase, whom he deposed as prime minister in 2006 and who retains strong support amongst the 57% of the population who are indigenous Fijians, and Mahendra Chaudhry, who resigned from the government last year and whose Fiji Labour Party has long been the party of choice for the 37% of the population who are Indians. The two men want fresh elections by October 2010. 
Of those politicians who remain in the commodore's cabinet, most have no credibility, having been rejected at the last poll, held in 2006. Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, who became president on November 5th, had his nomination as vice-president rejected in 2007 by the Great Council of Chiefs, then the appointing authority for both posts. As Mr Bainimarama made clear in July when he acknowledged that Mr Qarase would win an election if one were held soon, he has strong reasons for delaying both election and diplomatic normality until 2014.","A coup leader who is tough on the outside, softer underneath

After years of campaigning, survivors gathered to hear Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, offer a formal apology for this ""great evil"". It was the second such apology Mr Rudd has offered in under two years. Early last year, he began his government's first term by apologising to the ""stolen generations"": children, many of mixed race, taken by the authorities from aboriginal families. In all, by 1970 over 500,000 ""stolen"", migrant and non-indigenous children had been placed in church, charity and government institutions.
Mr Rudd's latest apology has focused attention on Britain's grim ""child migration"" scheme, under which children as young as three were sent to the former colonies of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, often without their parents' knowledge or consent. One motive was racial: the young countries wanted ""British stock"". Australia took about 10,000 children, most of them after Canada reduced its intake in the 1940s. 
After a report 12 years ago cast light on the plight of the stolen generations, other victims of institutional mistreatment agitated for redress as well. They found a supporter in Andrew Murray, then a member of the Senate. Mr Murray was born in Britain and placed in an institution, aged two--and sent to Southern Rhodesia two years later. Eventually he was reunited with his mother and emigrated to Australia.
Senate inquiries produced a report (""Lost innocents"") on these child migrants eight years ago, and another on the ""forgotten Australians"" of the child institutions three years later. Both called for official apologies, which the former conservative coalition government of John Howard refused. Mr Rudd promises to help victims who wish to trace their families or are seeking to make provision for old age. 
After an inquiry in 1997-98, Britain's government expressed ""sincere regrets"" over the migrations. Now Gordon Brown, Britain's prime minister, has indicated that he too will apologise formally, early next year. As Mr Murray notes, apologies can do only so much. ""Messing up children this way has profound economic effects as well,"" he says. And that is the least of it. ""Lost opportunities lasting lifetimes can harm society dearly."" For that reason--as well as common humanity--even more important than the apology is the safety of some 30,000 children still under Australian government care.

AMERICANS support the idea of controlling emissions. In a poll published in October by the Pew Research Centre, 50% of those who had an opinion supported limits, compared with 39% against. Other polls have shown higher levels of support. But that apparent enthusiasm is qualified by a number of factors.
The first is price sensitivity. In a poll in August, 58% said they would support a cap-and-trade system that increased monthly electricity bills by $10, but for an increase of $25 the figure dropped to 39%. 
Second, ignorance and indifference are rife. Whereas half of the respondents to the Pew poll who knew about cap-and-trade supported the idea, 55% had never heard of it. In a Gallup poll in September, 1% cited the environment as America's most important problem, 26% health care and 29% the economy.
Third, scepticism seems to be on the rise. The Pew poll showed a fall in the proportion of Americans who thought there was solid evidence of rising global temperatures, from 71% in April 2008 to 57% in October 2009. The proportion blaming rising temperatures on human activity also fell over the period, from 47% to 36%.
It is hard to see how scientific developments could be responsible for this shift. It seems more likely to be the result of economics. When people are poorer they may be less willing to support policies that will cost them money, but feel uncomfortable about jeopardising the planet's future to fatten their bank balance. Scepticism absolves them of selfishness.
Figures from other countries support the idea that attitudes have changed during--and possibly as a result of--the recession. A poll published by the European Commission showed a fall in the number of EU citizens who saw climate change as the world's gravest problem from 62% in spring 2008 to 50% in July 2009. Over the same period the proportion citing global recession as their main concern rose from 24% to 52%. 
In Australia, meanwhile, where Kevin Rudd's support for mitigation helped him win the 2007 election--probably the first election anywhere in which climate change played a serious part--a poll published in July by the Lowy Institute showed that the proportion of voters who were prepared to shoulder ""significant costs"" to tackle global warming had fallen to 48% from 68% in 2006.","Do n't count on public opinion to support mitigation

KEVIN RUDD, Australia's prime minister, has much political capital riding on his promise to tackle climate change. It helped him win power in 2007. He calls it ""the great moral challenge of our generation"". His Labor government's planned cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emissions is designed to force Australians to change the way they use energy. Mr Rudd was banking on Parliament's approving it in time to give him clout at the Copenhagen climate talks that start on December 7th. Australia accounts for almost 1.5% of global greenhouse-gas emissions; but its reliance on coal (also its biggest export by volume) for most of its electricity helps to make it one of the highest emitters per person. But on December 2nd Parliament rejected his scheme. This did more than dash Mr Rudd's hopes of leading the world on climate-change reform. It set Australia up for a possible early election on the issue.
The upset was triggered by two weeks of turmoil in the conservative Liberal Party, the main member of the opposition coalition. Having passed the lower house of Parliament, the climate legislation was stuck in the Senate, the upper house, where the government lacks a majority. In August an unlikely alliance of Greens (who thought the scheme too weak), the coalition and two independents rejected it. Malcolm Turnbull, the Liberal leader, then persuaded his party to strike a deal with the government to make the scheme more business-friendly. To start in 2011, it set targets to cut carbon emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020, or 25% depending on post-Copenhagen global action. 
Mr Turnbull had long championed such a scheme. His deal secured an extra A$7 billion ($6.4 billion) in sweeteners over ten years for coal-fired electricity generators and high carbon-emitting industries. It excluded agriculture altogether. But even this was too much for the Liberals' climate-change sceptics, led by Nick Minchin, the party's Senate leader. He recently dismissed action against climate change as an extreme-left plot to ""deindustrialise the Western world"" after the collapse of communism. Just as Senate Liberals were preparing to pass the climate bill, Mr Minchin and several other sceptics revolted. On December 1st Liberal members of both houses unseated Mr Turnbull and replaced him as party leader with Tony Abbott, one of the prime sceptics. 
Mr Abbott beat Mr Turnbull by just one vote. But he quickly killed any commitment to the compromise and resolved to kill the bill in the Senate. Two Liberals, nonetheless, defied their new leader and tried vainly to save it by voting with the government. One, Judith Troeth, told the chamber of her rural experience: ""Droughts are longer. Rainfall has dropped...I believe there is global warming."" 
More broadly, the fight was over the Liberal Party's future direction. Mr Turnbull's liberal views on social issues, and status as a former leader of Australia's republican movement, grated with party traditionalists. He lasted as leader just 15 months. At 52, Mr Abbott inherits the Liberals' conservative mantle from John Howard, the former prime minister who ignored climate change for most of his 11 years in power. Mr Abbott opposes abortion, stem-cell research and gay marriage. He once called the notion of human-induced climate change ""crap"". He now excuses that as hyperbole; but he has stripped the Liberals of any credible stand on the issue.
The defeat has flummoxed business and mining leaders, who were preparing for the higher costs of a carbon-trading economy. The Australian Industry Group, a big business lobby, had endorsed the Rudd-Turnbull deal days before its demise. John Connor, head of the Climate Institute, a Sydney research body, says Australia now risks becoming a ""carbon backwater"". Mr Rudd still seems determined to get his scheme into law before an election due in late 2010. The bill's second Senate defeat gives him the constitutional option of calling one earlier. Before he does that, the government will take the unusual step of proposing the bill a third time, in February. Mr Abbott, his party's third leader in two years, says he is not frightened of a climate-change election. Mr Turnbull frets aloud that it could wipe the Liberals out.","A climate - change election looms

WHEN Asian boosters of regional integration talk about their cause's glorious future they tend not to mention its dodgy past. Yet 80 years ago a Bengali, Rabindranath Tagore, Asia's first Nobel laureate, stirred crowds in India, China and Japan by calling for a pan-Asian spiritualism to counter Western materialism. Both he and Sun Yat-sen, China's anti-imperialist exile, greatly admired the idea, fostered by Japan, of an ""Asia for the Asiatics"". 
Well, none of this looks so good to Asians now. Japan's enslavement of much of Asia gave pan-Asianism a bad name. And, although decolonisation after the second world war led to calls for a kind of Asian commonwealth, post-war fraternity soon crumbled, as cold-war fault-lines hardened. And if there is a transcendent reality that unites Asians today, it's the iPhone.
Yet the dream of greater integration refuses to die. In September Japan's new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, proposed a sweeping East Asian Community. This caused a stir, since Japan had slapped down a similar idea peddled in the 1990s by Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's former leader, for a regional ""caucus"" (without Caucasians, it was noted). More recently, in Sydney from December 3rd-5th, Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, invited 200 officials and academics from 22 countries to flesh out what he calls an Asia-Pacific Community (or, more modestly, an Asia-Pacific community). 
Much is vague about what Mr Hatoyama wants. But, nudged in the right direction, his idea could develop in a practical way, helping to boost trade and investment. Over the past couple of decades Japan has failed to foster an economy led by domestic consumption, so it still depends for growth, despite the global crunch, on trade. Trade integration is the only way forward. China, Japan and South Korea, deciding to pursue ""future-oriented"" relations among themselves (ie, don't mention the war), have agreed to look at a three-way free-trade agreement (FTA).
It is early days. Neighbours complain that Japan has few practical proposals for regional co-operation. Meanwhile, easily the region's two biggest economies, Japan and China, would be better reaching a bilateral FTA first. China needs Japanese environmental and other expertise, while ageing Japan needs high-growth investment returns. A two-way agreement, much more easily reached than a three-way one, would bring $1 trillion in efficiencies, claims Andy Xie, a China-based economist. After the foundation for an East Asian free-trade area was laid, it would be a relative doddle to plug it into the much smaller emerging free-trade block being developed by the ten-member ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations). That is all down the road. For now, Mr Hatoyama's proposal means the world's second-biggest economy, long ambivalent about its links with the rest of Asia, has decided to pursue regional integration. 
Mr Rudd's ambitions have a more strategic sweep. Many have long argued that Asia's institutional architecture falls short, with a mess of competing structures that include the big if ineffectual APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, a talk-shop on trade), ASEAN, ASEAN+3 (ie, plus Japan, China and South Korea) and the newish and still wobbly East Asia Summit (EAS, made up of ASEAN+3, India, Australia and New Zealand). Rationalise these structures, some argue, and Asia will be on the way to becoming another European Union--superior of course, thanks to Asia's famous work ethic and felicitous flair for consensus. 
Rather than think first about acronyms, the Rudd idea, as Hadi Soesastro and Peter Drysdale, respectively Indonesian and Australian academics, put it, is grounded in big shifts in the structure of regional and world power. Well before the financial crisis, economic and strategic weight was clearly moving to Asia, thanks largely to the rise of China and India. But the region lacked the institutional capacity to respond to these structural shifts, and to how the rest of the world was reacting to them. And they are, to put it mildly, far-reaching. One change, for example, is China's potential to challenge the primacy of American power in East Asia.
The financial crisis helped the region to wake up to another reality: the scale of Asia's global responsibilities. Asia was slow in recognising the contribution to the global crisis of home-grown, mainly Chinese, imbalances, and has been slow in helping shape a new global order. East Asia, write Mr Soesastro and Mr Drysdale, ""had significant prudential responsibility and it failed collectively at every stage to exercise it."" 
The message is now getting home, which helps explain why Mr Rudd's idea of a ""community"", roundly panned when he first unveiled it, is now viewed with more respect.

Caption: Economist.com/blogs/banyan","The cause of regional integration in Asia faces better odds than in a long while 
 WHEN Asian boosters of regional integration talk about their cause 's glorious future they tend not to mention its dodgy past . Yet 80 years ago a Bengali , Rabindranath Tagore , Asia 's first Nobel laureate , stirred crowds in India , China and Japan by calling for a pan - Asian spiritualism to counter Western materialism . Both he and Sun Yat - sen , China 's anti - imperialist exile , greatly admired the idea , fostered by Japan , of an "" Asia for the Asiatics "" . 
 Well , none of this looks so good to Asians now . Japan 's enslavement of much of Asia gave pan - Asianism a bad name . And , although decolonisation after the second world war led to calls for a kind of Asian commonwealth , post - war fraternity soon crumbled , as cold - war fault - lines hardened . And if there is a transcendent reality that unites Asians today , it 's the iPhone . 
 Yet the dream of greater integration refuses to die . In September Japan 's new prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , proposed a sweeping East Asian Community . This caused a stir , since Japan had slapped down a similar idea peddled in the 1990s by Mahathir Mohamad , Malaysia 's former leader , for a regional "" caucus "" ( without Caucasians , it was noted ) . More recently , in Sydney from December 3rd-5th , Kevin Rudd's , invited 200 officials and academics from 22 countries to flesh out what Kevin Rudd calls an Asia - Pacific Community ( or , more modestly , an Asia - Pacific community ) . 
 Much is vague about what Mr Hatoyama wants . But , nudged in the right direction , his idea could develop in a practical way , helping to boost trade and investment . Over the past couple of decades Japan has failed to foster an economy led by domestic consumption , so it still depends for growth , despite the global crunch , on trade . Trade integration is the only way forward . China , Japan and South Korea , deciding to pursue "" future - oriented "" relations among themselves ( ie , do n't mention the war ) , have agreed to look at a three - way free - trade agreement ( FTA ) . 
 It is early days . Neighbours complain that Japan has few practical proposals for regional co - operation . Meanwhile , easily the region 's two biggest economies , Japan and China , would be better reaching a bilateral FTA first . China needs Japanese environmental and other expertise , while ageing Japan needs high - growth investment returns . A two - way agreement , much more easily reached than a three - way one , would bring $ 1 trillion in efficiencies , claims Andy Xie , a China - based economist . After the foundation for an East Asian free - trade area was laid , it would be a relative doddle to plug it into the much smaller emerging free - trade block being developed by the ten - member ASEAN ( Association of South - East Asian Nations ) . That is all down the road . For now , Mr Hatoyama 's proposal means the world 's second - biggest economy , long ambivalent about its links with the rest of Asia , has decided to pursue regional integration . 
 Kevin Rudd's ambitions have a more strategic sweep . Many have long argued that Asia 's institutional architecture falls short , with a mess of competing structures that include the big if ineffectual APEC ( Asia - Pacific Economic Co - operation , a talk - shop on trade ) , ASEAN , ASEAN+3 ( ie , plus Japan , China and South Korea ) and the newish and still wobbly East Asia Summit ( EAS , made up of ASEAN+3 , India , Australia and New Zealand ) . Rationalise these structures , some argue , and Asia will be on the way to becoming another European Union -- superior of course , thanks to Asia 's famous work ethic and felicitous flair for consensus . 
 Rather than think first about acronyms , the Kevin Rudd idea , as Hadi Soesastro and Peter Drysdale , respectively Indonesian and Australian academics , put it , is grounded in big shifts in the structure of regional and world power . Well before the financial crisis , economic and strategic weight was clearly moving to Asia , thanks largely to the rise of China and India . But the region lacked the institutional capacity to respond to these structural shifts , and to how the rest of the world was reacting to them . And they are , to put it mildly , far - reaching . One change , for example , is China 's potential to challenge the primacy of American power in East Asia . 
 The financial crisis helped the region to wake up to another reality : the scale of Asia 's global responsibilities . Asia was slow in recognising the contribution to the global crisis of home - grown , mainly Chinese , imbalances , and has been slow in helping shape a new global order . East Asia , write Mr Soesastro and Mr Drysdale , "" had significant prudential responsibility and it failed collectively at every stage to exercise it . "" 
 The message is now getting home , which helps explain why Kevin Rudd's idea of a "" community "" , roundly panned when Kevin Rudd first unveiled it , is now viewed with more respect . The G20 's rapid eclipse of the G7 as the chief forum for co - ordinating global economic policy argues for heavier - hitting Asian arrangements to allow Asia 's G20 members better to represent the continent . Handling economic crises and monitoring climate - change obligations also point towards stronger regional architecture , both for formulating and policing commitments . Into the soup

HE birth of the cult of fine wine can be dated precisely. On April 10th 1663, Samuel Pepys, diarist and man-about-London, noted that he had enjoyed ""a sort of French wine called Ho Bryan that hath a good and most particular taste that I never met with"". 
He drank what is now called Chateau Haut Brion at the Royall Oak Tavern in the heart of London, one of many such establishments that had sprung up after the return from exile of King Charles II three years earlier and which offered such new delicacies as tea, coffee and classy wines. The hedonistic atmosphere of the times was responsible for the introduction not only of ""Ho Bryan"" and the other great wines of Bordeaux, but also of port from the Douro Valley in Portugal, the sparkling wines of Champagne and the brandy from a little town called Cognac, north of Bordeaux. 
As Pepys was savouring his tipple, big economic shifts were under way. London was on the rise, starting to replace Amsterdam as the hub of world trade. Its merchants were growing in power, wealth and appetite--for, amongst other luxuries, claret. By the 18th century Londoners were the world's biggest consumers of good claret. 
Previously drinks became famous and popular because of their royal connections. The court of France's King Louis XIV, who himself drank Burgundy and the still wines of Champagne, was the arbiter of most alcoholic taste. Now, for the first time, a wider social group, including both aristocrats and commoners such as Pepys with fashionable aspirations, set the tone. 
The English had been drinking claret for five centuries before Pepys's time; but it was poor stuff, shipped immediately after the harvest and drunk quickly before it turned to vinegar the following spring. As late as the end of the 17th century it continued to be drunk mostly by those who wanted ""claret to cool their port"" in the words of one observer. Much of it was fake. A poet calling himself Satyrical Dick wrote how a ""jolly wine-cooper"" could combine a ""pint of old port"" with some rough Spanish wine and thus ""could counterfeit claret the best of the sort"". 
The owners of Ho Bryan were the Pontacs. They were the top winemaking family of their day, and founded a fashionable restaurant, called Pontack's Head, in London, in 1663. John Locke, the philosopher whose theory of the social contract inspired America's revolutionaries, but who had worldlier interests too, spotted the reasons for the superiority of Ho Bryan on a visit to the vineyard in 1667. He found ""a little rise of ground...white sand mixed with a little gravel; scarce fit to bear anything."" He added that ""they say the wine in the next vineyard to it, tho' seeming equal to me, is not so good."" Today that vineyard is still rated just below its neighbour. 
Locke had seized on the essential concept of terroir, the combination of soil, subsoil, drainage and microclimate which provide the conditions for the production of fine wine. Another connoissseur, the 18th-century economist Adam Smith, noted that ""the vine is more affected by the difference of soils than any other fruit tree. From some it derives a flavour which no culture or management can equal."" 
Claret was getting more popular partly because it was getting better. The craft of claret-making had developed. By the early 18th century, the wine was designed to be kept for years not months, notably by being carefully stored in oak casks. Better corks allowed wine to be stored longer and more safely. Bottles were produced that could be ""binned""--laid down on their sides to mature.
By Smith's time the shape of the industry was established for centuries to come. Advertisements in the London Gazette at the time noted the sale of wines from four chateaux: Haut Brion, today a green oasis in Bordeaux's suburbs, and Latour, Lafite and Margaux, all on the gravel banks above the Gironde estuary in the Medoc, the peninsula north of Bordeaux. The four estates remain the greatest brands in wine. Their main competitors, then as now, are a handful of tiny vineyards in Burgundy. 
British appetite for their produce was growing; but so, too, were the obstacles to getting hold of it. Britain, Portugal and their allies were at war with France and Spain. Port (from Portugal) was therefore considered the patriotic drink. In a comedy called ""The Winder"", staged in 1714, one character protested that ""I have been drinking Claret and Champaign and Burgundy and other French wines, Sir, but I love my country for all that."" The vendors in the 1707 sales, and many others, claimed that their supplies were captured by British ships in the fighting; but they probably weren't.
In the 18th century drinking claret helped the rich to distinguish themselves from England's port-sodden squirearchy. Port was not only the more traditional drink, but also--because it attracted much lower duties--far cheaper. John Hervey, the first Earl of Bristol, spent four times as much on claret as on port, whereas the lusty trenchermen who gathered in the Barbers Hall in the City of London spent a mere Pounds 2 on claret as against Pounds 850 on port. 
When Britain made peace with France in 1713, claret became more accessible and the wine trade flourished. Claret was pricey but rich Londoners, who were also by then big spenders on theatres, spas and music produced by fashionable immigrants, such as Handel, consumed conspicuous quantities. Sir Robert Walpole, Britain's first prime minister, used navy ships to smuggle his favourite wines from France. The most expensive one he bought was old burgundy, but that--as now--was available only in tiny quantities. So he relied largely on claret, buying four hogsheads of 24 dozen bottles of Margaux and one hogshead of Lafite every three months. In a single year his wine bill amounted to over Pounds 1,200 (Pounds 100,000 today). British consumers bought the best stuff and paid top prices. By the time of the French revolution, the British were paying five times as much for their claret as the wine's other main customers, the notoriously parsimonious Dutch, who preferred the cheaper, lower-grade stuff.
The wines were no longer drunk, or even bought, when young: in 1714 Walpole was buying bottles of the 1706 vintage of the classier wines. His sophistication was echoed by that of his clerk, who was notable at the time for his ability to spell all four estates correctly. In the 18th-century accounts Lafite rarely had only a single f and t, Margaux was spelt Margoose, Margose, and Margon, and the O'Brian variation on Haut Brion led to constant speculation over the years that the owner was Irish. 
Claret was still largely for the prosperous well into the 19th century. In ""Every Man His Own Butler,"" published in 1839, Cyrus Redding, a wine merchant and author, wrote ""claret for a bishop, port for a rector, currant for a curate and gin for the clerk"". The fine-wine merchant was an unusually respectable figure--for a tradesman. In a newspaper article Anthony Trollope described one of them, ""Mr Prettyman"", as ""a handsome old gentleman with grey hair, always well-dressed"". Three of his contemporaries survive today--Corney & Barrow in the City of London, Justerini & Brooks and Berry Bros & Rudd in St James's Street, just down the road from The Economist.
But claret was beginning to flow down the social hierarchy. A free-trade treaty between Britain and France in 1860 drastically reduced the duty on French wines, thus encouraging the British middle classes to ape their social superiors; and in that year the chancellor of the exchequer, William Gladstone, keen to stiffen the nation's moral spine, cut the duty on table wines to 40% of that on more intoxicating fortified wines such as port and sherry. 
The following year came the Single Bottle Act, allowing grocers to sell wine by the bottle. A much-despised, enormously popular drink called ""grocers' claret"" was born, with the result that, between 1859 and 1878, sales of French wines, largely from Bordeaux, rose sixfold to 36m bottles. The Gilbey family, one of the most remarkable commercial dynasties of Victorian England, franchised 2,000 grocers licensed to sell wine, largely claret. Their business grew so fast that by 1875 they were able to buy Chateau Loudenne in the Medoc to hold their gigantic stocks of claret. As the middle classes turned to claret, so the upper classes abandoned this increasingly common tipple in favour of hock and champagne.
Then the fortunes of the claret business turned. In the late 1870s and 1880s an attack of mildew tainted the wines: the reputation of Lafite, for instance, was ruined when the 1884 vintage turned mouldy after only a couple of years in bottle. At the same time, the phylloxera bug began to devastate Bordeaux's vineyards.
Claret came back into its own in 1960 when the splendid 1959 vintage coincided with the arrival of big American buyers. Its popularity has risen steadily since. London remains at the centre of the fine-wine business--home of organisations such as the Institute of Masters of Wine, of Decanter and World of Fine Wine magazines, and of most of the world's biggest wine auctions. Liv-Ex, the world's first stockmarket for fine wine, is based in London; and its figures show that nine-tenths of the wine trade is still in ""classed growth"" (leading) clarets. Newcomers from vineyards in a dozen countries trying to launch their finest wines on the world market come to London first for validation. Yet though London may still have much of the knowledge and the market, as consumers the British may be past their best. This year, 57% of the fine wine that Sotheby's sold globally, by value, was bought by Asians; four-fifths of those buyers were from China and Hong Kong. ""

The global recession and the strength of the Australian dollar have also sapped the country's appeal to foreign students. In all, applications for student visas have fallen by 23% in the past year. Dennis Murray, the executive director of the International Education Association of Australia, a trade group, is expecting a quick recovery. He foresees growth of 4% a year over the next 20 years.

AS HE prepares to call an election later this year Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, is hoping his government's handling of the global financial crisis might help him win a second term. Australia was one of the few rich countries to avoid a recession. Unemployment in December fell to 5.5%. But a report published on February 1st announces an even bigger challenge for the economy: a population explosion. 
The report, from the federal Treasury, foresees Australia's population growing by almost two-thirds over the next 40 years--to 36m--about 25% higher than the Treasury had predicted just three years ago. Some of the boom will be home-grown, as young Australian women are having more children than did their baby-boomer predecessors. But a larger proportion will come from immigration. Up to last year, Australia had been taking about 244,000 immigrants a year. 
The big intake will at least help to compensate for an ageing population. Almost 90% of today's immigrants are younger than 40, compared with only 55% of native Australians. Nonetheless the number of Australians aged between 65 and 84 will more than double by 2050, and the number of those aged over 85 will more than quadruple. So many oldies will mean almost half of government spending going to health care and support for the elderly. Yet the proportion of working-age taxpayers will be only about half as big as now. 
Mr Rudd has said he believes in ""a big Australia"". More people, he argues, will contribute to the country's prosperity and boost its influence in Asia. But since these latest demographic projections, he has been touring Australia's big cities warning that the country must lift productivity, or risk unsustainable budget deficits later on.
Some experts argue that the environmental costs of a big Australia are an even bigger worry than the fiscal ones. A decade of drought has left the country's water supplies depleted. Until recent rains, the Lachlan river had stopped flowing in some of the farming regions of New South Wales, the most populous state. The Treasury's report says climate change poses as serious a threat to Australia as does the ageing of its population. This week Mr Rudd's government brought back to Parliament a bill to create an emissions-trading scheme, though the upper house rejected it twice last year. He seems determined to force a showdown over the issue.
Ken Henry, the head of the Treasury, questions the capacity of a country as hot and dry as Australia to sustain so many people. He is also pessimistic about the prospects for biodiversity. He recently cited the granting of permits over the past decade that have allowed the commercial slaughter of 50m kangaroos ""primarily to give household pets a bit of variety in their diet"". This suggests, he said, that even with only 22m people, ""we haven't managed to find accommodation with our environment.""

YOU might think that Clay Johnson, a campaigner for transparency, would be pleased to see a ferret, with a deerstalker hat and magnifying glass, pop up on his screen. This creature is the mascot for BetaDataFerrett, an online application offered by America's Census Bureau.
In fact, Mr Johnson hates the beast. A builder of digital tools that make sense of public information, he does not need anybody to supply him with applications. All that he and his colleagues want at their Sunlight Labs--part of a non-profit group based in Washington, DC--is machine-readable data. Once he has facts that can be pulled into a computer program, he can do the ferreting for himself.
Still, Sunlight and other campaigners for better access to official information have had much to celebrate over the past year. The governments of America, Britain, Australia and New Zealand have all produced collections of machine-readable data. A British site entitled data.gov.uk was launched last month; the plan is to post a growing supply of facts that citizens or private institutions can sift through and play with as they choose. 
In several countries political leaders now talk the same language as campaigners for transparent government. On his first full day in office, Barack Obama signed an open-government directive. David Cameron, the leader of Britain's Conservatives, wants to increase his country's transparency to tame the over-mighty state, for which he blames the present Labour government. In Australia Kevin Rudd's Labor Party also took power with a strong commitment to open government.
For political leaders, access to data can be a way to keep their own bureaucracies under control, and to foil foot-dragging by opponents. For example, free access to data on carbon footprints might be a way for Mr Obama to counter environmental sceptics. In his administration the task of linking information to policy--which may sometimes mean guarding data and sometimes making facts more available--has been given to two young technocrats with family roots in India. Vivek Kundra is the government's chief information officer (cio), and Aneesh Chopra has a new job of chief technology officer (cto). 
Apart from their political uses, openly available data (about the weather, say, or from global positioning satellites) have proved valuable to many people. The British initiative, led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the internet, reflects his belief that any data can be useful.
But even as politicians start seeing the light, the pace and methods used by governments to free up facts are much influenced by independent, open-source software designers. (One reason that English-speaking governments are ahead of others is that there are a lot of activist anglophone open-source programmers.) Most of the data sets offered by governments bear the stamp ""beta"", suggesting that they are open to improvement. With unusual humility, bureaucrats are borrowing jargon from open-source developers.
In the past, governments have asked large companies, like LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, to help them handle data better. But when free, machine-readable data become available, pretty much anyone can have a go. In America, Britain and Australia, government agencies have held competitions to encourage small designers or non-profit outfits to find ingenious things to do with the stuff.
In 2008 the city of Washington, DC, a trailblazer in the field of open data, sponsored a contest called ""Apps for Democracy""--with $50,000 in costs and prize money--which produced 47 applications. A competition called ""MashupAustralia"" has been run by the Government 2.0 Taskforce, a body set up by Mr Rudd to make administration more open. Results include a map of crime in New South Wales, and a tool for sharing data about needed road repairs called ""It's Buggered, Mate"".
All these exercises--in which anybody with a bright idea can use government data--seek to merge two cultures: the risk-averse ethos of the civil service, and the free-wheeling spirit of open-source developers, who seek continuous incremental change and see failure as a step to improvement. In a way that would baffle most old-time bureaucrats, independent developers like to collaborate over long distances and make their exchanges public.
In one culture clash, Nathan Torkington, an open-source consultant, helped New Zealand's government assemble sets of data. After a meeting with a minister, he sent a summary of what he learned to members of his mailing list and he was gratefully accosted by subordinates of the minister who said they found out a lot about their boss.
In the world of open-source development, projects can end with a ""codeathon"" in which collaborators try to mesh their ideas in a burst of creative effort. This can be useful, but it differs a lot from the average bureaucrat's working day.
Among America's number-crunchers-in-chief, it is Mr Chopra whose office comes closest to the new culture of using data in a free, creative way. He thinks more government agencies should mimic the division of labour that now defines his own job at the top of the American administration: a CIO who guards stable information platforms and a CTO who cultivates data-handling talent in the open market.
Letting in the creative air
Gradually, government agencies are realising that contributions from small data handlers are not only tolerable, but desirable. America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency is writing guidelines for contests, prizes and more open IT--procurement policies with the aim of opening up the field to smaller, more agile sellers of applications. (The Sunlight Foundation, for example, was not eligible to build recovery.gov, a data site that tracks America's stimulus bill.) 
Mr Chopra says the staff at many agencies are eager to release data, not merely to obey Mr Obama's instructions, but to gather support for their own projects. In some cases they are proud of their work and want to share it. Michael Wash, the chief information officer of America's government printing office, recalls the shock of some college students when he offered to give them the data they had been scraping off his website. 
Sometimes people in government do some unlikely things--and they have a stake in making sure their work does not go to waste. (Witness the person at Australia's Department of Health and Ageing who collected a data set on the location of public toilets.) Over time, civil servants are becoming more open-minded, and developers more attuned to the needs of government. But they struggle to agree on the main question: which data have value?
Tom Steinberg, a British pioneer of data use, believes that what is valuable is what the market already pays for. He runs mySociety, a non-profit organisation founded in 2003 that builds simple web-based tools with self-descriptive names like ""faxyourmp"" and ""fixmystreet"". Location is crucial to detecting patterns in public information; a map of crimes is more valuable than a list. Britain's Ordnance Survey owns the country's geographic data and, through an arrangement known as a ""trading fund"" sells them to, among others, mySociety. In 2008 economic analysis commissioned by Britain's Treasury argued that the public value of the trading-fund information was greater than its revenue value to the crown; mapping data will be released free of charge from April.
But more British bulk data have been wholly or partially privatised. The Royal Mail sells postcode information, and transport timetables are sold by private rail carriers. MySociety has access to the boundary lines of voting districts through what Mr Steinberg calls ""a bizarre restrictive licence"". He is pleased by the data collection that has just been posted in Britain. But he notes that much of what he really needs, and now pays for, is not included.
Some special factors were at work in Britain. Dazzled, perhaps, by the magic of the Berners-Lee name, government ministers moved fast in 2009 to release whatever non-controversial information they had to hand. It is true, moreover, that Sir Tim never turns up his nose at any data, believing that even the most arcane may be handy for someone. Under his benign aegis, data.gov.uk was developed by a small group of programmers using open-source methods. The result is a geek's dream: plenty for creative types to work on, but a bit baffling to the lay person. 
Some American open-data initiatives have a more user-friendly face. For example, Recovery.gov offers charts, maps and search fields. It displays some of the data on state spending that Britons lack. Local newspapers are using the site to determine how much stimulus spending has landed in their own back yards. The name ""recovery"" suggests an interpretation of spending that suits the president. The underlying data may be neutral, but there is always some spin in a website's presentation. 
To the relief of people like Mr Johnson, the ferret-hating software developer, there is also a place where nothing but raw information is offered: data.gov, America's central collection of machine-readable data. At the same time, Mr Chopra and Mr Kundra, America's First Geeks, are considering how to respond better to requests for new data, and looking for some degree of consensus on what constitutes ""high value"" information. For Mr Chopra, one ambition is to find a way of linking specific budget items to actual expenditure.
But whatever governments do, the presentation of endless facts can fall flat unless there are independent developers who know what to do with them. As Mr Torkington admits, failing to grasp this point led to disappointing results in New Zealand. In his enthusiasm for technology, he failed to think much about who would use the data he was posting, and why. A wad of facts was dumped in cyberspace, with no instructions or incentives to find good ways of using them. There they sit, unread by any machine. Even the geekiest types can be nonplussed when they are presented with data but no purpose.","In several countries more official data are being issued in raw form so that anybody can use them .

2010-02-06,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/223979844/fulltext/6B99F7DBFB084CCDPQ/61?accountid=14657,"In many prosperous democracies, a crisis-driven backlash against the political right failed to materialise. Why so?
""THIS financial crisis"", said Daniel Cohn-Bendit in 2008, ""is for capitalist neoliberals what Chernobyl was for the nuclear lobby."" As the recession began claiming the livelihoods of ordinary workers, other politicians of the left avoided the incendiary glee of the German MEP and former street fighter. Still, many shared his expectation of a popular backlash against their foes on the right. 
It seemed plausible at the time. The conservative predicament was embodied a year and a half ago by John McCain, whose campaign floundered on the issue of the economy as the implosion of Lehman Brothers portended a banking crisis. And some obituaries for the centre-right had been written at least a year earlier. The subprime mortgage storm was brandished by America's Democrats as a repudiation of a deregulatory fad that began in the Reaganite 1980s.
Yet the crisis of the right has yet to come about. Last year's European Parliament elections were a triumph for conservatives. Britain's Tories crushed Labour; President Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP became the first ruling party in France to win a European election since 1979. In Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland conservatives also prospered. A few months later Angela Merkel was re-elected as Germany's chancellor--this time with the pro-market Free Democrats instead of the Social Democrats as coalition partners. The right's ascendancy across the continent was crowned last November when the European Union's newly created presidency was given to Herman van Rompuy, a Belgian conservative. The latest gathering (see picture) of the European People's Party--an umbrella body which includes a dozen heads of government--was a buoyant affair.
Similar trends are visible in some other democracies. In 2008 New Zealand's National Party won power, ending almost a decade of Labour Party rule. The Conservatives in Canada were re-elected in the same year. And one of the sweetest victories for the European centre-right may be at hand. David Cameron, say the polls, will soon be Britain's first Conservative prime minister since 1997.
Why has the crisis of capitalism not become a political crisis for the centre-right? And why have conservatives in Europe had a better recession than their counterparts in America, which until recently seemed like the exception to the conservative mood in the rich democracies? True, the centre-right is not without hope there. The Republicans have enjoyed recent triumphs in Virginia, New Jersey and Massachusetts. They can expect to make further gains in this year's mid-term elections. But they were ejected from the White House during the recession, and have fewer congressmen, senators and state governors than the Democrats. Even if their recent recovery proves to be enduring--which is, as yet, far from obvious--a puzzle remains as to why the European centre-right coped so much better during the economic crisis. 
It is tempting to seek an answer in the impersonal workings of the political cycle. Voters blame recession on the incumbents, regardless of ideology. So, it can be argued, Mr Cameron may win because it is ""his turn"", not because of a popular shift to the right. Equally, the loss of power endured in 2008 by America's Republicans and a year earlier by the Australian Liberals (in power since 1996) may not be confounding exceptions to a broader conservative ascendancy. They may just be examples of democracy's routine ebbs and flows. 
But those cyclical explanations only go so far. The Gaullists have held the French presidency since 1995, yet still prosper at the polls. Bar a two-year interlude by Romano Prodi, a social democrat, the conservative Silvio Berlusconi has been Italy's prime minister since 2001. Mrs Merkel has been chancellor of Germany since 2005. Were election results determined only by a pendulum, the centre-left in these countries would have swung back by now.
It may be more useful to look at public attitudes to capitalism. Polls suggest that the popular backlash against the economic system has been less sharp than the left expected. Last November a survey of 29,000 people across 27 countries (almost all democracies) by GlobeScan and the BBC World Service found that only 23% agreed that capitalism is ""fatally flawed"" and needs replacing. Some 51% believed it had problems that could be addressed through regulation and reform, and a further 11% were happy with the system as it is. Similarly, there was more support for an increased government role in redistributing wealth and regulating businesses than for outright state control of big industries. 
A Rasmussen poll last April caused consternation when it said just 53% of Americans preferred capitalism to socialism. But it did not define either term. A poll a few months earlier by the same outfit found 70% backing a ""free-market economy"", suggesting that Americans may distinguish between markets (honest, tangible enterprise) and capitalism (shady, chimeral high-finance). Other Rasmussen polls during the recession found that only 14% thought the government would do a better job of running car companies, and even fewer trusted it to run financial firms. Survey evidence from elsewhere tells the same story: the loss of trust in the market has not been entirely offset by enhanced trust in government. 
This helps explain why the left has failed to sweep ahead in the recession, but not why the centre-right has advanced. One reason may be that non-economic issues dear to conservatives--like crime, immigration and national security--matter at least as much in recessionary times. Certainly, Mr Cameron's narrative of British social decline has resonated with voters. For Mr Sarkozy, a firm line on crime and the secular ideals of the French republic have been keys to success. And in Australia a notionally leftist leader, Kevin Rudd, has played up his credentials as a social conservative.
But none of this quite explains what has happened in America. To find better answers, it may help to look past pendulums and polls and turn to the rarefied realm of political ideas. It surely matters that in European countries, where the centre-right has thrived, it can tap into traditions of conservatism that reject all-out liberalism in the economic sphere.
German Christian Democracy, for instance, mixes a commitment to the welfare state with quiet conservatism on social and cultural matters. That has been a winning formula for most of the Federal Republic's history. The French equivalent, Gaullism, differs from the creed of Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. It is more militaristic, and too secular to take its cue from Catholic social teaching. But at its core is the same paternalist belief in the state's duty to protect citizens from the turmoil of the market, and to play a strategic role in shaping the economic arena. It was clearly with relish, not reluctance, that Mr Sarkozy declared that ""laissez-faire is finished"" after Lehman Brothers collapsed.
This dirigiste culture is weaker on the British right. There is certainly little enthusiasm among Tories for an industrial policy that guides investment and protects national champions from foreign takeover. But for most of its history, the party has embraced the notion of the state as a provider of social protection. Victorian Tories such as Benjamin Disraeli led the way in civilising industrial Britain with public infrastructure and regulation of the workplace. The One Nation Conservatives of the mid-20th century did not tamper with the welfare state they inherited from the post-war Labour government. 
There are echoes of genteel paternalism in Mr Cameron's pitch to voters, in his respect for the ""little platoons"" of independent charities, in his refusal to countenance spending cuts to the National Health Service. Margaret Thatcher's ""dry"" free-market conservatism looks more like an outlier in Tory history, a response to economic calamity rather than an expression of the party's deepest ideological convictions. ""We are a Conservative Party"", said George Osborne, the Tories' economic spokesman, last year, ""not a libertarian party."" 
In America it is much harder to make this distinction. Centre-right paternalism is not completely unknown there: the Eisenhower presidency of the 1950s often mirrored the ""Butskellite"" consensus in favour of the welfare state that prevailed in Britain at the time. Even the younger George Bush expanded Medicare coverage (to ruinous cost) and increased federal involvement in education. But the American right has often been defined above all else by hostility to big government. 
Perhaps this reflects the country's lack of a feudal history. Without an aristocracy, Americans never had the European fear of the market's power to disrupt old social orders. It is no coincidence that the centre-right in Australia, another settler society, shows a similar zeal for the market (even if, like the Republicans, it still wants subsidies for special-interest groups like farmers). This broadly pro-market climate makes it harder for conservatives in the New World to ride out the recession by playing the paternalist card. 
Does Canada, a New World country where the centre-right holds power, disprove that rule? In fact, special circumstances prevail there. The (centre-left) Liberals were tainted by scandal, and were exhausted after 13 years in power, by the time of the 2006 election. Even then, only a minority Conservative government emerged. Stephen Harper, the prime minister, has to engage in political manoeuvres to achieve his goals. To pass legislation, he has to take careful account of three other parliamentary parties--all of which are, to varying degrees, left of centre. 
In America some conservative thinkers conclude that the Republicans can rebuild a winning coalition only by adopting a more nuanced view of government. David Frum, a former White House speechwriter, toils away on the cause. Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam, two journalists, have called for a ""grand new party"" that is willing to use the state to help working-class voters cope with stagnating wages and other anxieties. But some of the party's activists and front-line politicians are, if anything, getting more zealous for small government after the profligate Bush years. 
In such a climate it would be hard for Republican politicians to bash bankers or support government intervention, even if they wanted to. Their counterparts in Europe can more easily steal crowd-pleasing rhetoric and policy from the left. The intellectual heritage of their parties ensures there will be no backlash from ideological purists comparable to Sarah Palin, the star of a recent gathering of the anti-government tea-party movement. 
Quite the opposite. It was pressure from within her own party that persuaded Mrs Merkel to set up a vote-winning ""Germany Fund"" to help businesses cope with recession. Gaullists love Mr Sarkozy's support of a Tobin tax on currency speculation. Some Tories may grumble about Mr Cameron's accommodation with Labour's ""big state""--but they do so quietly. He has had the latitude to make promises to protect health spending and clamp down on bankers, while avoiding promises to reverse recent tax rises. 
This emphasis on ideas may seem a rather lofty way of explaining the success of European conservatives during the recession, and the struggle of their allies in younger democracies to find a coherent and convincing voice. But more worldly accounts, which fail to take account of ideology and history, don't quite add up.","In many prosperous democracies , a crisis - driven backlash against the political right failed to materialise . Why so ? 
 "" THIS financial crisis "" , said Daniel Cohn - Bendit in 2008 , "" is for capitalist neoliberals what Chernobyl was for the nuclear lobby . "" As the recession began claiming the livelihoods of ordinary workers , other politicians of the left avoided the incendiary glee of the German MEP and former street fighter . Still , many shared his expectation of a popular backlash against their foes on the right . 
 It seemed plausible at the time . The conservative predicament was embodied a year and a half ago by John McCain , whose campaign floundered on the issue of the economy as the implosion of Lehman Brothers portended a banking crisis . And some obituaries for the centre - right had been written at least a year earlier . The subprime mortgage storm was brandished by America 's Democrats as a repudiation of a deregulatory fad that began in the Reaganite 1980s . 
 Yet the crisis of the right has yet to come about . Last year 's European Parliament elections were a triumph for conservatives . Britain 's Tories crushed Labour ; President Nicolas Sarkozy 's UMP became the first ruling party in France to win a European election since 1979 . In Italy , Spain , Portugal and Poland conservatives also prospered . A few months later Angela Merkel was re - elected as Germany 's chancellor -- this time with the pro - market Free Democrats instead of the Social Democrats as coalition partners . The right 's ascendancy across the continent was crowned last November when the European Union 's newly created presidency was given to Herman van Rompuy , a Belgian conservative . The latest gathering ( see picture ) of the European People 's Party -- an umbrella body which includes a dozen heads of government -- was a buoyant affair . 
 Similar trends are visible in some other democracies . In 2008 New Zealand 's National Party won power , ending almost a decade of Labour Party rule . The Conservatives in Canada were re - elected in the same year . And one of the sweetest victories for the European centre - right may be at hand . David Cameron , say the polls , will soon be Britain 's first Conservative prime minister since 1997 . 
 Why has the crisis of capitalism not become a political crisis for the centre - right ? And why have conservatives in Europe had a better recession than their counterparts in America , which until recently seemed like the exception to the conservative mood in the rich democracies ? True , the centre - right is not without hope there . The Republicans have enjoyed recent triumphs in Virginia , New Jersey and Massachusetts . They can expect to make further gains in this year 's mid - term elections . But they were ejected from the White House during the recession , and have fewer congressmen , senators and state governors than the Democrats . Even if their recent recovery proves to be enduring -- which is , as yet , far from obvious -- a puzzle remains as to why the European centre - right coped so much better during the economic crisis . 
 It is tempting to seek an answer in the impersonal workings of the political cycle . Voters blame recession on the incumbents , regardless of ideology . So , it can be argued , Mr Cameron may win because it is "" his turn "" , not because of a popular shift to the right . Equally , the loss of power endured in 2008 by America 's Republicans and a year earlier by the Australian Liberals ( in power since 1996 ) may not be confounding exceptions to a broader conservative ascendancy . They may just be examples of democracy 's routine ebbs and flows . 
 But those cyclical explanations only go so far . The Gaullists have held the French presidency since 1995 , yet still prosper at the polls . Bar a two - year interlude by Romano Prodi , a social democrat , the conservative Silvio Berlusconi has been Italy 's prime minister since 2001 . Mrs Merkel has been chancellor of Germany since 2005 . Were election results determined only by a pendulum , the centre - left in these countries would have swung back by now . 
 It may be more useful to look at public attitudes to capitalism . Polls suggest that the popular backlash against the economic system has been less sharp than the left expected . Last November a survey of 29,000 people across 27 countries ( almost all democracies ) by GlobeScan and the BBC World Service found that only 23 % agreed that capitalism is "" fatally flawed "" and needs replacing . Some 51 % believed it had problems that could be addressed through regulation and reform , and a further 11 % were happy with the system as it is . Similarly , there was more support for an increased government role in redistributing wealth and regulating businesses than for outright state control of big industries . 
 A Rasmussen poll last April caused consternation when it said just 53 % of Americans preferred capitalism to socialism . But it did not define either term . A poll a few months earlier by the same outfit found 70 % backing a "" free - market economy "" , suggesting that Americans may distinguish between markets ( honest , tangible enterprise ) and capitalism ( shady , chimeral high - finance ) . Other Rasmussen polls during the recession found that only 14 % thought the government would do a better job of running car companies , and even fewer trusted it to run financial firms . Survey evidence from elsewhere tells the same story : the loss of trust in the market has not been entirely offset by enhanced trust in government . 
 This helps explain why the left has failed to sweep ahead in the recession , but not why the centre - right has advanced . One reason may be that non - economic issues dear to conservatives -- like crime , immigration and national security -- matter at least as much in recessionary times . Certainly , Mr Cameron 's narrative of British social decline has resonated with voters . For Mr Sarkozy , a firm line on crime and the secular ideals of the French republic have been keys to success . And in Australia Kevin Rudd , has played up Kevin Rudd's credentials as a social conservative . 
 But none of this quite explains what has happened in America . To find better answers , it may help to look past pendulums and polls and turn to the rarefied realm of political ideas . It surely matters that in European countries , where the centre - right has thrived , it can tap into traditions of conservatism that reject all - out liberalism in the economic sphere . 
 German Christian Democracy , for instance , mixes a commitment to the welfare state with quiet conservatism on social and cultural matters . That has been a winning formula for most of the Federal Republic 's history . The French equivalent , Gaullism , differs from the creed of Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl . It is more militaristic , and too secular to take its cue from Catholic social teaching . But at its core is the same paternalist belief in the state 's duty to protect citizens from the turmoil of the market , and to play a strategic role in shaping the economic arena . It was clearly with relish , not reluctance , that Mr Sarkozy declared that "" laissez - faire is finished "" after Lehman Brothers collapsed . 
 This dirigiste culture is weaker on the British right . There is certainly little enthusiasm among Tories for an industrial policy that guides investment and protects national champions from foreign takeover . But for most of its history , the party has embraced the notion of the state as a provider of social protection . Victorian Tories such as Benjamin Disraeli led the way in civilising industrial Britain with public infrastructure and regulation of the workplace . The One Nation Conservatives of the mid-20th century did not tamper with the welfare state they inherited from the post - war Labour government . 
 There are echoes of genteel paternalism in Mr Cameron 's pitch to voters , in his respect for the "" little platoons "" of independent charities , in his refusal to countenance spending cuts to the National Health Service . Margaret Thatcher 's "" dry "" free - market conservatism looks more like an outlier in Tory history , a response to economic calamity rather than an expression of the party 's deepest ideological convictions . "" We are a Conservative Party "" , said George Osborne , the Tories ' economic spokesman , last year , "" not a libertarian party . "" 
 In America it is much harder to make this distinction . Centre - right paternalism is not completely unknown there : the Eisenhower presidency of the 1950s often mirrored the "" Butskellite "" consensus in favour of the welfare state that prevailed in Britain at the time . Even the younger George Bush expanded Medicare coverage ( to ruinous cost ) and increased federal involvement in education . But the American right has often been defined above all else by hostility to big government . 
 Perhaps this reflects the country 's lack of a feudal history . Without an aristocracy , Americans never had the European fear of the market 's power to disrupt old social orders . It is no coincidence that the centre - right in Australia , another settler society , shows a similar zeal for the market ( even if , like the Republicans , it still wants subsidies for special - interest groups like farmers ) . This broadly pro - market climate makes it harder for conservatives in the New World to ride out the recession by playing the paternalist card . 
 Does Canada , a New World country where the centre - right holds power , disprove that rule ? In fact , special circumstances prevail there . The ( centre - left ) Liberals were tainted by scandal , and were exhausted after 13 years in power , by the time of the 2006 election . Even then , only a minority Conservative government emerged . Stephen Harper , the prime minister , has to engage in political manoeuvres to achieve his goals . To pass legislation , he has to take careful account of three other parliamentary parties -- all of which are , to varying degrees , left of centre . 
 In America some conservative thinkers conclude that the Republicans can rebuild a winning coalition only by adopting a more nuanced view of government . David Frum , a former White House speechwriter , toils away on the cause . Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam , two journalists , have called for a "" grand new party "" that is willing to use the state to help working - class voters cope with stagnating wages and other anxieties . But some of the party 's activists and front - line politicians are , if anything , getting more zealous for small government after the profligate Bush years . 
 In such a climate it would be hard for Republican politicians to bash bankers or support government intervention , even if they wanted to . Their counterparts in Europe can more easily steal crowd - pleasing rhetoric and policy from the left . The intellectual heritage of their parties ensures there will be no backlash from ideological purists comparable to Sarah Palin , the star of a recent gathering of the anti - government tea - party movement .

In a sea of international opprobrium. But a compromise may be at hand
IF YOU'RE tempted by a slab of meat gristle which surrenders little but an ooze of grease when chewed, then you'll love whale. Add to the sensory experience the accumulated mercury to be found in whale meat. Consider the suffering caused by the hunt to these intelligent mammals; and a military-industrial approach to their extermination. Japan going a-whaling is, to borrow from Oscar Wilde, the unspeakable in pursuit of the almost uneatable. 
As with foxhunting in Britain, views seem irreconcilable. Since 1986 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling. Yet every Antarctic summer, Japan sends a whaling fleet south to catch hundreds of whales for ""research"". And every year at the IWC's meeting, pro- and anti-whaling camps gather in sullen deadlock. On the whaling grounds the Japanese fleet encounters the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The ocean warriors hurl rancid butter on Japanese decks, use warps to foul propellers and attempt citizen's arrests of the whaling captains. Early this year a Sea Shepherd boat sank after a collision. Now an American film has turned a spotlight on Japan's coastal hunt for cetaceans. ""The Cove"", shot largely in secret, shows the annual dolphin slaughter in Taiji, a village on Japan's main island. This week it won an Oscar. 
The slaughters have damaged Japan's standing among ordinary folk abroad. Now relations with Australia, Japan's closest friend in Asia, are at risk. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, has threatened to sue Japan in the International Court of Justice if it does not give up whaling by the start of the next season, in November. In response, Japan's pro-whaling position appears only to have hardened. With veiled threats, whaling groups urge cinemas in Japan not to show ""The Cove"". Two activists from Greenpeace claiming to have uncovered corruption in Japan's Antarctic whaling programme have themselves been put on trial.
When the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) came to power last year, it had few pro-whaling instincts, unlike the Liberal Democratic Party before it. Yet it now finds itself courting international disapproval both over whales and over tuna. This week an international wildlife-protection body begins a meeting that is likely to impose a ban on trading northern Atlantic bluefin tuna. Many Japanese, it seems, would be angry if they were not allowed to eat a prized source of sushi and sashimi to extinction. Some critics extrapolate a national pathology that goes beyond conservation. Japan, they say, is turning its back on the world. 
A visit to Taiji gives a slightly different perspective. It is one of Japan's more intriguing and distinctive spots. People have family names like Tomi (literally, lookout), Kaji (ironsmith) and Amino (net). Four centuries ago locals made breakthroughs in harpoon technology and the use of nets to slow down migrating whales. An old painting shows villagers at sea using ladders to scale a slaughtered right whale. Old stone monuments appease the whale spirits, but the meat sustained Taiji through famines.
As well as going after dolphins, villagers not allowed to hunt the minke whales along the coast have turned to hunting (rarer) toothed whales not covered by the IWC's moratorium. They understandably resent the IWC, which has allowed several indigenous groups to hunt whales for ""subsistence"" since 1986. The Makah Indians in Washington state had entirely forgotten how to hunt or handle a boat. Caribbean islanders from Bequia may go after humpbacks, yet learned whaling only in the 1870s, and that from New Englanders. Taiji's men have chased whales on Japan's coast for perhaps millennia.
The Antarctic, however, is a different kettle of fish. With industrial-scale whaling, cultural claims ring hollow. Douglas MacArthur launched Japan's modern whaling because he wanted protein for a hungry land after the second world war. These days few outside strongholds like Taiji have a taste for whale meat. The state whaling company is kept afloat with cheap loans and subsidies. Sea Shepherd, too, has an impact: the fleet is landing only half the whales it aims to catch. The 200-odd Antarctic whalers and the bureaucrats that back them are just the kind of special interest the DPJ claims to take on. But whaling constituencies swung to the DPJ in the last election. And, when Sea Shepherd is not on the scene, whaling attracts scarcely any interest among the wider population, largely ignorant of foreign disapproval. Public sentiment on whaling, for and against, is anaemic. To have your fox and eat it
So perhaps common ground might be found after all. Last year a former foreign-ministry spokesman, Tomohiko Taniguchi, broke ranks. Japan should think about giving up Antarctic ""research"", he said, in return for a limited resumption of commercial coastal whaling. As well as the damage to Japan's international standing, he also pointed out that meat from Antarctic whaling spoilt the market for Japan's handful of local whalers. The deadlocked IWC may be groping towards a similar solution. A proposal named after its head, Cristian Maquieira, aims for a big cut in catches in return for limited commercial whaling by those already taking whales, while bringing ""research"" whaling under IWC control. Japan appears interested, though details will become clearer only with the IWC's annual meeting this summer. 
Conservationists would rail against any resumption of commercial whaling. So would Australia. But the motives for Mr Rudd's whale-protection fervour are not wholly pure. Australia has territorial claims on Antarctica and adjacent seas. Meanwhile, Mr Rudd hopes his zeal will draw urban voters away from the Greens in the next general election, which will helpfully fall before the November deadline. Even so, a deal would be far better than continued stand-off. Whale meat would remain uneatable, but the pursuit of it would be a little more speakable.","Economist.com/blogs/banyan

INSTEAD of welcoming Barack Obama to Australia, Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, was this week saddled with the ordeal of a televised debate with Tony Abbott, the opposition leader. The subject, health reform, mirrored the one that led Mr Obama to postpone his visit. At stake for Mr Rudd was his sweeping plan for the federal government to take over from the states most funding for Australia's 762 cash-stretched public hospitals. The first of several planned debates gave voters a foretaste of the federal-election campaign due later this year: Mr Abbott, the attack dog, against Mr Rudd, the unflappable, dry bureaucrat. According to television ""worms"", tracking viewers' instant responses, unflappable aridity won hands down: by 71% to 29%, says one network.
He badly needed the boost. An opinion poll a week earlier showed his approval rating at 48%, the lowest since he led the Labor Party to power in late 2007 (see chart). So far, voters have seen little from Mr Rudd's promise to change Australia with such projects as an education ""revolution"" and a high-speed broadband network. And his most cherished reform, an emissions-trading scheme to tackle climate change, is stuck in the upper house of parliament, where his government lacks a majority. In the press, the public service and privately in his own party, Mr Rudd's setbacks have sparked gripes about his attempts to micromanage policy.
The health plan he launched early this month allowed him fresh momentum. Australia's six states run and mostly pay for public hospitals. Crowded wards and lengthy waiting lists are common. The Treasury calculates that, in 35 years, health alone will consume the states' entire revenues, thanks to a growing and ageing population, and soaring costs. Mr Rudd proposes that Canberra almost double, to 60%, its share of hospital financing, and take over all aged-care costs. Many doctors' groups agree that tighter standards over how the money is spent will make hospitals more accountable. Ronald Penny, a doctor member of an inquiry that sparked the Rudd plan, argues the federal government should go further and spend more trying to prevent people needing hospitals at all: he cites figures showing one-tenth of teenagers drink enough alcohol to cause probable harm to their health later.
Winning the states over to Mr Rudd's centralist power grab is proving harder. His government has also proposed replacing the states' primary and secondary school curriculums with a national one in history, English, science and mathematics. George Williams, a constitutional expert, argues that both decisions are yet another blow to the states' roles in Australia's federal set-up. ""Their existence is guaranteed, but their relevance isn't,"" he says.
Mr Rudd plans a showdown on his health plan with all six state leaders on April 19th. Unless all agree to relinquish their powers (Victoria and Western Australia are resisting loudly), he still has enough political capital to carry out his threat of holding a referendum on the issue at the federal election. The election's timing is up to Mr Rudd. Despite his own sliding popularity, the latest opinion poll gives the government a comfortable winning margin. Another poll shows almost 80% of Australians support the health plan. Mr Abbott's legacy as a health minister in the former conservative coalition government, which cut the federal share of health spending, hardly helps his cause.","The health - care debate Obama missed

Barack Obama hosted a summit on nuclear security. The leaders of 46 countries attended, including China's president, Hu Jintao (Israel's Binyamin Netanyahu declined the invitation). There were assurances from most nations, such as Ukraine, to do more to tighten controls over nuclear material, but no binding agreements. 
Mr Obama and Mr Hu held a meeting on the margins of the summit. Mr Hu's attendance was seen as a friendly gesture after a period of frosty relations, thawed in part by America's decision to delay a report that might have labelled China a manipulator of its currency.
John Paul Stevens announced that he would retire from America's Supreme Court this summer. Justice Stevens, the longest-serving member of the present court and the de facto leader of its liberal block, said he hoped his successor would be confirmed by the time the new term convenes in the autumn. Elena Kagan, the solicitor-general, led the field of those hoping to replace him. 
Arizona's legislature passed a tough law that gives local police the authority to check the documentation of anyone they suspect merely of being in America illegally and allows residents to compel the police to enforce the law.

Sudan extended its elections, which began on April 11th, from three days to five, amid growing claims of rigging in the north, where the main opposition boycotted the polls.

The Catholic child-abuse scandal rumbled on. To howls of outrage, a senior cardinal claimed that he had documents indicating that psychiatrists had demonstrated a link between homosexuality and paedophilia. The Vatican later attempted to ""clarify"" the remarks.
Defence posture
Barack Obama hosted a summit on nuclear security. The leaders of 46 countries attended, including China's president, Hu Jintao (Israel's Binyamin Netanyahu declined the invitation). There were assurances from most nations, such as Ukraine, to do more to tighten controls over nuclear material, but no binding agreements. 
Mr Obama and Mr Hu held a meeting on the margins of the summit. Mr Hu's attendance was seen as a friendly gesture after a period of frosty relations, thawed in part by America's decision to delay a report that might have labelled China a manipulator of its currency.
John Paul Stevens announced that he would retire from America's Supreme Court this summer. Justice Stevens, the longest-serving member of the present court and the de facto leader of its liberal block, said he hoped his successor would be confirmed by the time the new term convenes in the autumn. Elena Kagan, the solicitor-general, led the field of those hoping to replace him. 
Arizona's legislature passed a tough law that gives local police the authority to check the documentation of anyone they suspect merely of being in America illegally and allows residents to compel the police to enforce the law. The bill has to be reconciled with an earlier version and signed by the governor, but some senior policemen think it could hurt relations with Arizona's migrant community. Polls apart
Sudan extended its elections, which began on April 11th, from three days to five, amid growing claims of rigging in the north, where the main opposition boycotted the polls. President Omar Bashir is certain to retain the national presidency. There was little rancour in the south, where a single party is overwhelmingly dominant and most southerners have set their sights on a referendum early next year that could lead to independence.
Congo's government said the UN's 20,000-plus peacekeepers should leave the country next year, raising fears that chaos might return without an independent force continuing to hold the ring. Sporadic violence persists across the country, especially in the east.

WHEN Kevin Rudd became Australia's prime minister in 2007 he promised big changes to the draconian treatment the conservative coalition of his predecessor, John Howard, had dished out to asylum-seekers. He insisted his government would be tough on people-smugglers, but humane towards refugees. Since then, his Labor government has speeded up the processing of applications, reforming a regime where some had languished behind wire for years. On April 9th, though, the government suggested that humanity has its limits: it suspended processing asylum applications from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan for three and six months respectively. Human-rights experts accused Australia of slipping back to the dark days of 2001, when the former government sent the navy to push boat people back to sea.
The move is not quite that extreme; but it is driven by similar populist impulses. So far this year, the authorities have intercepted 42 boats, just 18 fewer than in the whole of last year, carrying 1,970 asylum-seekers (compared with 2,726 in all 2009), mainly Afghans and Sri Lankans. The two groups make up 85% of the boat people Australia has accepted as refugees.
Although the government abolished its predecessor's ""Pacific solution"", which sent detainees to grim camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, it still gives a nod to old Australian anxieties about the threat of incoming hordes from the north. Applicants are now kept on Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, about 5,000km (3,125 miles) from the big cities. The rising numbers might still be comparatively small; but the opposition and the tabloid press have waged fear campaigns accusing the government of ""losing control"" of Australia's borders.
The government justifies its new stand by arguing that Afghanistan and Sri Lanka are ""evolving"" from their war-torn situations; it suggests a forthcoming review of both countries by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees might mean fewer asylum-seekers will be afforded refugee status. Amnesty International, among others, is not impressed. It worries that more countries could take Australia's decision as a pretext to put pressure on the UN to stop processing Afghan and Sri Lankan refugees in Asia.
For other critics, the decision smacks more of a cynical fix to stop tabloid carping in an Australian election year. Even that may not work. Two boats with 55 passengers arrived within days of the government's announcement; more are said to be on their way. Cathy Branson, head of the Australian Human Rights Commission, says Christmas Island's remoteness and crowded conditions make it the wrong place to detain people. Indeed, closing Christmas Island would seem to make sense on two counts. It would save Canberra money. And shifting asylum-seekers to the even more dismal detention centres on the Australian mainland might even deter boats. The political risks, though, make such a move unlikely.","Do n't seek asylum in an election year

Greece had earlier asked for the formal activation of a EUR 45 billion ($60 billion) rescue package co-ordinated by the European Union and the IMF. As stockmarkets swooned, pressure mounted on the leaders of euro-zone countries, particularly Germany's Angela Merkel, to agree quickly on the details of the bail-out. Many reckoned that the size of a Greek rescue would need to rise to EUR 120 billion or more.

The act was condemned by Barack Obama, who said it undermined ""basic notions of fairness"", and the Mexican government warned its citizens against travelling to Arizona. But supporters of the legislation, including John McCain, argued it had been enacted because of ""enormous frustration"" at the surge of illegal workers in the state. 
That row had a knock-on effect on a bipartisan effort to craft an energy and climate-change bill as Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator, withdrew his crucial support and blamed what he said was a partisan attempt to refocus on immigration. Senior Democrats confirmed they were drafting a framework for an immigration-reform bill.

ONLY a few months ago Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, was painting a dark picture about looming storm surges, rising sea-levels, a fall of over 90% in irrigated farming and a drop of nearly 2.5% in GNP over this century unless Australia took action against climate change. ""Action now,"" he declared. ""Not action delayed."" But this week Mr Rudd climbed down from what seemed a defining pledge of his leadership. Instead of using this year to get parliament to adopt an emissions-trading scheme that would put a price on carbon pollution, action will now be delayed until 2013 at least. Some wonder if it will ever happen at all.
Few leaders have staked more than Mr Rudd on tackling climate change. The issue helped him lead the Labor Party to power in late 2007, after the former conservative coalition government had largely ignored it. Relying on coal for most of its electricity, Australia is one of the world's highest carbon-emitters per person. Mr Rudd hoped that forcing it to change how it uses energy would give the country clout in forging a global consensus.
All that unravelled late last year. His government's planned cap-and-trade scheme set targets to cut carbon emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020, or 25% as part of concerted global action. Having initially supported the scheme, the main opposition Liberal Party used its controlling numbers in parliament's upper house in early December to block it for a second time. The failure of the Copenhagen climate summit that month took more shine off the vision. 
With an election due this year, Mr Rudd always held a constitutional trump card: the power to dissolve both houses of parliament together, and resubmit the bill to the new parliament. Instead, looking somewhat sheepish, he announced in Sydney on April 27th that the government would now do nothing until the period covered by the Kyoto protocol ends in late 2012. He offered two excuses: the need for more time to judge any global actions on climate change before Australia goes ahead itself; and the opposition's ""backflip"" in parliament.
The backflip may be just as much Mr Rudd's. In a speech in November to the Lowy Institute, a think-tank, he dismissed as parochial and ""absolute political cowardice"" the notion that Australia should not act until others do. Citing government figures, he warned that a delay would end up costing Australia 15% more to adapt to climate change later.
A Lowy poll this week found that 72% of those questioned thought Australia should take action to reduce carbon emissions before a global deal is reached. But the share who were not prepared to pay higher electricity bills had risen by about half in two years. Another poll by the Climate Institute, a lobby group, found support for Mr Rudd in dealing with climate change had dropped by ten points from February last year, to 36% this month. John Connor, the institute's head, reckons both polls reflect Australians' frustration at the failure to get a scheme started, rather than any wavering in faith in the scientific evidence for climate change.
Mr Rudd's own wavering suggests reluctance to let an issue that has turned messy spoil his re-election chances. He has recently promised to spend A$5.4 billion ($4.9 billion) to buy the support of Australia's states for his planned takeover of the country's health system by the federal government. This seems a surer vote-winner than an emissions-trading scheme that opposition scare tactics portray as a ""great big new tax on everything"". But ""political cowardice"" may cost votes, too.","Make us greener , oh lord . But not yet

HIGH commodities prices should mean happiness for the mining industry. Instead, they spell vulnerability. On May 2nd Australia, the industry's largest source of many minerals, proposed a new, 40% tax on what it defines as ""super profits"". A decline in the price of Australian mining shares that began in April, as word of the new tax emerged, accelerated sharply (see chart). Some fear that other governments could follow suit.
Squeezing natural-resources firms is hardly unprecedented--even in Australia itself, which imposed a surcharge on oil exploration decades ago during a prior boom. The politics are appealing. Natural resources are seen by many as a national patrimony, meaning all profits should be shared. Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, noted that hefty chunks of two big mining companies with listings in Australia, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, are held by foreign shareholders. That, said Mr Rudd, means a lot of benefits from Australian resources have gone to non-Australians. It helps too that supporters of the Labor government do not live in Western Australia, where the country's big mineral deposits are located and the taxes will be paid.
The economics of the new tax are trickier. Because mining firms comprise a large slice of the Australian stockmarket, the decline has had a big impact on other investors too. The very fact that the government can impose a special tax on one industry will have investors worried about similar measures being applied elsewhere. That should, in theory at least, mean they will charge higher costs for their funding.
As for the mining companies themselves, they have little choice about where to operate but they will inevitably reorganise their financial structures to be tax-efficient. That would mean shifting more costs into Australian operations to depress reported profits. It may also mean that miners alter their capital structures to put more emphasis on debt, which is tax-deductible, rather than equity. If so, increases in leverage would increase their vulnerability to swings in commodity prices. 
The outright impact of the tax, along with how it is applied (notably whether projects with losses can be netted against projects with gains), could have a severe impact on the Australian resource sector, says Ray Ball, a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business and a scathing critic of similar measures back in 1984. At least one deal, a bid by Peabody Energy for Macarthur Coal, was being reassessed after this week's announcement.
The Rudd government argues that investment will not be impeded because the tax is applied to profits beyond what is necessary to fund reinvestment--likely to be a rate lower than the government-bond yield plus five percentage points. That has the potential to inspire furious debate beyond mining. The claim that a fair rate of return can be set by fiat, rather than the market, for an industry that is prone to booms and busts has obvious appeal elsewhere. The IMF's proposals for new bank taxes already nod towards the idea of creaming off excess profits. Miners may be miserable now, but banks also have reason to worry about events down under.","The economic and political justification of a tax grab 
 HIGH commodities prices should mean happiness for the mining industry . Instead , they spell vulnerability . On May 2nd Australia , the industry 's largest source of many minerals , proposed a new , 40 % tax on what it defines as "" super profits "" . A decline in the price of Australian mining shares that began in April , as word of the new tax emerged , accelerated sharply ( see chart ) . Some fear that other governments could follow suit . 
 Squeezing natural - resources firms is hardly unprecedented -- even in Australia itself , which imposed a surcharge on oil exploration decades ago during a prior boom . The politics are appealing . Natural resources are seen by many as a national patrimony , meaning all profits should be shared . Kevin Rudd's noted that hefty chunks of two big mining companies with listings in Australia , Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton , are held by foreign shareholders . That , said Kevin Rudd , means a lot of benefits from Australian resources have gone to non - Australians .

THE week began disastrously for Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister. An opinion poll showed a dramatic slump in his approval rating. His chances of leading the Labor government to victory at an election due later this year looked on a knife-edge. Then came the good news.
Australia's economy had already stood out from other rich countries' by surviving the global downturn without recession. As Wayne Swan, the treasurer, presented the budget for 2010-11 on May 11th, it seemed even more robust. A deficit of almost A$41 billion ($37 billion) is projected to become a surplus in 2012-13, three years earlier than first forecast. And the debt the government piled up to keep Australia afloat through the slump is also due to be paid off three years ahead of schedule, after peaking at 6.1% of GDP, a fraction of the percentage in the big rich countries in the G7 (see chart). ""Rudd in free fall"" headlines have disappeared, at least for now.
Australians, claims Mr Swan, ""have defied global economic gravity."" In the 12 months up to June 2010, the economy is expected to have grown by 2%; it is forecast to grow 3.25% next year and 4% in 2011-12. Unemployment has been falling steadily from its peak last year of 5.8%. The recovery has been humming so strongly that the central bank started raising interest rates in October, and has done so five times since. While people in most rich countries fret, a poll by the Lowy Institute, a think tank, found 86% of Australians optimistic about the country's economic performance over the next five years.
Canberra's financial mandarins attribute Australia's resilience partly to the government's well-directed fiscal stimulus, and to tight regulations that kept bank lending fairly conservative. But resource-rich Australia also enjoyed the sort of luck that has seen it weather other crises. Mr Swan says that, thanks to China's own stimulus last year, Australia's exports of iron ore and coal to its steel factories exceeded the government's hopes. 
The extra revenue will go more to repaying debt than on election-year splurges. Instead, the government plans to finance several reforms with two new taxes. In April it raised tobacco excise by 25% to help pay for its grand plan for the federal government to take over most of the financing of Australia's health system from the states. The second tax is more controversial. Spurred by a report by Ken Henry, head of the Treasury, the government wants to put a ""resource super-profits tax"" of 40% on the profits of mining companies. It will also cut company taxes overall. 
The mining companies are gearing up for a campaign accusing the government of killing Australia's golden goose. Citing uncertainty about the tax, Xstrata, a Swiss-based company, has suspended further exploration in Queensland, where it mines copper. After investing $38 billion since 2000, Rio Tinto, one of Australia's biggest miners, is now reviewing new projects. The campaign seems to be resonating: this week's poll showed more Australians opposed the tax than supported it.
The government argues that Australians are not getting their just rewards for the vast mineral reserves they own under their dirt. In the year to April, spot prices for iron ore and coal (among Australia's biggest exports) rose by 190% and 70% respectively. Yet a system of royalties based largely on the volumes mined--which the new tax would replace--has not kept pace with the miners' soaring profits. The actual charge to mining companies has fallen by more than half, from about 34% of profits earlier this decade to less than 14% in 2008-09.
Mr Rudd has little political capital to spare on a fight over mining. His opinion-poll rating has plunged by 14 percentage points in less than a month. More voters now disapprove of him than approve of him. The main cause for the slide seems to be his shelving of plans for an emissions-trading scheme to fight climate change, seen as one of his administration's main goals. This will save the government A$652 million over five years (although the same amount will be invested in renewable energy). The budget, though, discloses an even bigger climbdown: instead of being delayed until 2013, the emissions scheme will now happen ""only...if there is sufficient international action"". At least Mr Rudd can boast that he has been faithful to another important manifesto commitment: he won power in 2007 claiming to be a ""fiscal conservative"".","A rare rich - world leader for whom a budget brings good news

A STERN message greets visitors to a small town in one of outback Australia's most isolated regions: ""Warning. Prescribed Area. No Liquor. No Pornography."" The whitewashed buildings of Hermannsburg, in the red desert west of Alice Springs, date from its founding as a Lutheran mission in 1877. The sign is a much more recent addition. Mildred Inkamala, an aboriginal elder, points out a spot along the Finke River where an 18-year-old indigenous youth, high from sniffing petrol, raped and drowned a young girl.
Three years ago a report on the sexual abuse of children among indigenous communities in the Northern Territory shocked Australia. Aborigines comprise about a quarter of the territory's population, compared with 2% of Australia as a whole. The conservative government of the time, led by John Howard, announced the ""Northern Territory Emergency Response"". Better known as ""the intervention"", it imposed federal control over Hermannsburg and 72 other settlements. 
The Australian government began controlling how residents of the ""prescribed communities"" spend their share of public monies: half their income from welfare payments is quarantined for necessities such as food and children's clothes. As the intervention marks its third anniversary about 17,000 people are now on ""income-management"", a twelvefold increase since 2007. The current Labor government, led by Kevin Rudd, is preparing to roll back the intervention's most controversial element, which suspended laws against racial discrimination. But it also plans to broaden its provision of income-management. From July it will apply to all of the territory's welfare recipients, regardless of race. 
Human-rights activists are unimpressed. They view the intervention as a return to the official paternalism that prevailed before the aborigines won their long battle for land rights 35 years ago. Alastair Nicholson, a former judge, calls the Rudd government's changes a ""cynical attempt to perpetuate racial discrimination"". Among aborigines on the front lines however, opinion varies.
The contrast is most vivid in a fringe of 18 settlements around Alice Springs known as the town camps. Once places where desert aborigines came looking for work, they degenerated into pools of despair. Alcoholic binges, wife-beating, rape and murder were common. Late last year the federal government struck a deal with the Tangentyere Council, an indigenous body which controls the camps. The council granted 40-year leases to the federal government in exchange for A$100m ($92.6m) to clean up the town camps and build new houses. 
William Tilmouth, the council's director, still thinks the ""government knows best"" approach stinks of the notorious century of Australian policy that created the ""stolen generations"". Mr Tilmouth himself was one of those mixed-race children who were forcibly separated from their parents, ostensibly for their own good. He thinks the intervention should be ended.
Its proponents, however, point to the shaming statistic that aborigines on average die almost 11 years younger than other Australians. Ms Inkamala, for one, is a supporter of the intervention. A reformed alcoholic herself, she has a job and manages her own income. She has watched as Hermannsburg's primary-school attendance rate almost doubled, to 80%, since it started. The community's income-managed women, she reckons, have more money to spend on their children's welfare. Andrea Mason, the head of a local women's group, says income-management has stopped abusive men ""humbugging"" household money to spend on booze, drugs and gambling. Far from calling for it to end, she wants it extended outside the territory.

LESS than a year ago Kevin Rudd rode high as one of Australia's most successful prime ministers. Suddenly, his spectacular career has come to a crashing end. With his rating in the opinion polls sliding disastrously, and a federal election due soon, a panicked ruling Labor Party on June 24th dumped Mr Rudd as leader. They replaced him with Julia Gillard, his deputy. She will give a country once branded as a bastion of male chauvinism its first female prime minister. 
As his support crumbled among Labor's 115 federal parliamentarians, Mr Rudd had declared defiantly the previous evening that he would fight a leadership challenge from Ms Gillard. But the coup turned out to be bloodless. Faced with a humiliating defeat, when the moment came Mr Rudd stood aside. His colleagues elected Ms Gillard unanimously. Wayne Swan, the treasurer, will take over as deputy prime minister.
Instead of making a scheduled visit to the G20 summit in Canada, where he was due to meet Barack Obama, Mr Rudd has now become the only prime minister Labor has ditched during a first-term government. The speed of his demise has astonished Australia's political class. Labor had hailed him as a reformist hero after he led the party to power in late 2007, unseating the 11-year conservative coalition government under John Howard.
Mr Rudd started by ratifying the Kyoto protocol on climate change, then issued a long-awaited formal apology to Australia's indigenous people for past injustices. His approval rating reached 71% in April 2008; it was still at 63% last October. Until recently the Liberals, the main opposition party, looked as if they would present no threat in this year's election: since their defeat, they have swapped leaders three times.
All that changed in early May, when polls turned badly against Labor. In one month Mr Rudd's approval rating fell by 11 points, to 39%. Another poll earlier this month, showing the government's vote had fallen to 33%, sent tremors through Labor powerbrokers. Votes leaked more to the Greens than to the Liberals; but the poll still gave the opposition a winning lead, even after the distribution of second-preference votes. 
The trigger was Mr Rudd's decision in late April to defer a planned emissions-trading scheme (ETS) until at least 2013. Legislation for it is stuck in the Senate, the upper house of parliament, where Labor lacks a majority. Mr Rudd had made attacking climate change a defining pledge of his platform. His apparent decision to abandon it dismayed voters and damaged his credibility on other issues.
One of these was a ""resources super-profits tax"" which Mr Rudd announced last month. From 2012, it would tax mining profits at a rate of 40% after they reach a certain level. A noisy campaign against the tax by big mining companies drowned out Mr Rudd's claim that it was only a fair way of returning a mining boom's riches to Australians. Polls indicate public opinion is evenly split on the tax. 
Fears about the government's crumbling fortunes unleashed unhappiness among Mr Rudd's colleagues over his management style. A workaholic, he tended to control government as a one-man band, running the public service in Canberra ragged and shutting some colleagues out of key decisions. One environment minister learned of the ETS's deferral only by reading about it in the press. And Mr Rudd's short temper had won him few friends to call on when the final crisis loomed.
Choked with emotion after seeing Ms Gillard take over, he took credit for invoking a swift response to the global financial crisis with a fiscal stimulus that helped Australia avoid a recession. But Australians no longer seemed to be listening to his boasts about this and other achievements. The campaign starts here
At 48, and with a reputation as one of parliament's most combative debaters, Ms Gillard must now find ways to make them start listening again. Born in Wales, she emigrated with her parents as a small child. She entered parliament 12 years ago, after working as a lawyer. Her red hair, broad Australian accent and sharp mind have made her one of the most watched figures in Australian politics. From her base among Labor's left faction in Melbourne, Ms Gillard has moved pragmatically to the centre. She oversaw the Rudd government's partial dismantling of the Howard government's workplace laws, which had vested power mainly with employers. But she has also managed to forge cordial relations with business.
Ms Gillard fronted her first press conference as prime minister by declaring that a ""good government was losing its way"". She offered to ""re-prosecute"" the case for a price on carbon. And she proposed a deal to end the mining-tax row. She will cancel an expensive series of television ads the government had bought to sell its case (to no apparent avail), and ask the big mining companies to do the same. Both decisions will help give Ms Gillard something of a political honeymoon, and space to build support before the election she says will happen ""in coming months"". Human-rights leaders, though, worry that she may be tempted to ""lurch to the right"" (as Mr Rudd promised not to) on another issue draining the government's support: the growing number of asylum-seekers arriving in northern Australia by boat. 
Tony Abbott, the latest opposition leader, rates poorly with women voters. Ms Gillard is popular across party lines. Still shocked, the government can only gamble that her fresh approach and capacity to charm will prove the weapon it needs to win a second term.","Losing popularity , the Labor Party stages a surgical strike in the leadership

SINCE she unseated Kevin Rudd as Australia's prime minister late in June, Julia Gillard has moved swiftly to shore up the ruling Labor Party's crumbling support. Promising to ""speak plainly"" (which Mr Rudd never quite managed), Ms Gillard has spent her first three weeks reinventing three policies that had landed her predecessor with disastrous poll ratings: a ""resources super-profits tax"" on mining; measures to stop asylum-seekers arriving by boat in northern Australia; and action against climate change.
The polls have bounced back to give Labor a tight lead over the conservative coalition opposition (see chart). Under pressure to win a second term that party bosses had thought beyond Mr Rudd's reach, Ms Gillard may now bring forward to August an election otherwise due late this year.
She might be wise to make use of her political honeymoon. Ms Gillard has shaken up a country where married men have always led federal (but not state) governments. At 48, without children and with a partner who stays in the background, her domestic choices have not hobbled her rise. This week, nonetheless, she gave a speech aimed at reassuring families in middle Australia. Her Welsh-immigrant parents, she said, taught her the value of hard work and education. She has also vowed to make the cost of school uniforms tax deductible, saying that they give pupils ""a sense of discipline"".
Such efforts help to change her old image as a left-wing radical. So, too, will the deal on tax that she struck with BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata, Australia's three biggest mining companies. In May Mr Rudd said that a 40% tax would be levied on mining profits above a certain level. That now falls to 30% (lower, on some calculations) and applies only to iron ore and coal. At first the government claimed that this change would shave only A$1.5 billion ($1.3 billion) from the estimated A$12 billion revenue that the tax would earn in its first two years. But on July 14th officials conceded that, unless commodity prices keep rising, losses will be much greater.
Next Ms Gillard set out a plan for a ""regional centre"" in Timor-Leste (East Timor) to process asylum-seekers. So far this year, authorities have stopped 79 boats with 3,768 refugees, mostly Afghans, 1,000 more than in all of 2009; most are processed at Christmas Island, an Australian territory. The relatively small numbers have sent jitters through some marginal constituencies, encouraged by tabloid alarm and opposition calls to ""turn the boats back"".
But Ms Gillard's bid to sound tough on this does not ring entirely true. Critics recall how, eight years ago, she condemned as ""a costly and unsustainable farce"" the former conservative government's ""Pacific Solution"" of dumping asylum-seekers on island neighbours. Nor is Timor-Leste keen: on July 12th the parliament in Dili voted against the plan.
Ms Gillard also faces the problem of showing that the government is still serious about tackling climate change. Mr Rudd's misfortunes began in April, when he dropped a proposed emissions-trading scheme. Still, voters might be distracted by some cheery economic news. This week Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, said the budget will return to a surplus of A$3 billion in 2013, triple the forecast in May. And unemployment is down to 5.1%. The trumpeting of such figures may indeed suggest an election campaign is not far off.

IN HIS campaign for the general election on August 21st, Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, has run into a problem with women. Julia Gillard, the prime minister, easily outpolls him as a leader. One recent survey showed female voters favour Labor by a mighty 16 points, double the lead for all voters. And now Mr Abbott's frustrated colleagues seem to be trying the ""gender card"": highlighting Ms Gillard's status as an unmarried, childless woman (and an atheist, to boot). The idea is to appeal to conservatives in the populous states of New South Wales and Queensland, but it will inevitably drive yet more women away.
A year ago, few would have given Mr Abbott much hope of leading the Liberal Party, the main partner in the conservative-coalition opposition. As an ambitious health minister under John Howard, Mr Abbott antagonised some women when he tried (and failed) to ban access to a drug allowing abortion without surgery. Critics pointed to his past as a Catholic seminarian. As an anglophile, fond of the British monarchy, some senior Liberals worried that he was too close to Mr Howard and advised him not to seek the leadership.
The upheavals that have rocked Australian politics over the past seven months changed all that. Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Abbott's predecessor, had agreed with Kevin Rudd's government on an emissions-trading scheme to combat climate change. In December Mr Abbott led the party's hardliners in tearing up the deal and then unseated Mr Turnbull. Since then, statements that he felt ""threatened"" by homosexuality and that advised women not to treat virginity ""lightly"" have entrenched his image as a social conservative.
Mr Abbott faced Ms Gillard in the campaign's only televised debate on July 25th, attacking ""a great big new tax"" on big mining firms as likely to raise living costs and pledging to ""stop the boats"" bringing asylum-seekers to Australia. He also vowed to get immigration ""under control"" by cutting the 2008-09 intake of about 300,000 people by almost half. Ms Gillard retorted that her opponent was looking backwards, though her own party has been toughening its policies on some of those issues. 
The trouble for Mr Abbott is that turning even farther right puts him out of step with business, the Liberal Party's natural constituency, which favours immigration, as it fuels economic growth. Business is also unhappy with Mr Abbott's bid to counter his poor image with women by giving new parents paid leave. That would cost A$2.7 billion ($2.4 billion), financed by raising company tax by 1.7% on about 3,000 high-earning firms. 
But that is only if he gets to power. A poll on July 26th showed Labor's lead slightly down, but Mr Abbott remains the underdog.

Labor's Julia Gillard, who replaced Kevin Rudd as prime minister only six weeks ago, seems to have lost the ten-point lead she had when she called the election. Asylum offer for Ashtiani
Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, offered asylum to Sakineh Ashtiani, an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. Tehran rejected the proposal from its ally, saying that Lula was ""emotional"" and did not know all the facts of the case. Meanwhile a warrant was issued for the arrest of Ms Ashtiani's lawyer, who then fled to Turkey and applied for asylum.
Mexican security forces shot dead Ignacio ""Nacho"" Coronel, a top lieutenant in the Sinaloa drug-trafficking organisation. It is the first time that the government has killed a high-ranking member of the country's biggest drug gang.
Raul Castro, Cuba's president, announced that the government would remove some limits on licences for small businesses, and would allow them to hire employees. However, he ruled out broader changes to Cuba's centrally-planned socialist economy. Blood diamonds
Naomi Campbell, a model, testified at a war-crimes trial in The Hague over allegations that Charles Taylor, a former president of Liberia, had given her a diamond in 1997. The prosecution said she could prove that Mr Taylor passed on diamonds from war-torn Sierra Leone.
Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was reported to have survived a grenade attack on his convoy in the town of Hamedan. Apparently unhurt, he went on to address a rally in a football stadium. The government denied he was attacked, saying that a firecracker had exploded near his motorcade.
South Africa's former head of police, Jackie Selebi, was sentenced to 15 years in jail for taking bribes. He is the most senior official to have been convicted for corruption since the African National Congress was first elected in 1994.
Preliminary results of a referendum peacefully held on August 4th suggested that Kenyans strongly endorsed a new constitution that would entrench a presidential system, but with more checks and balances than before. Homeward bound
Barack Obama used a speech to veterans to confirm that America will end combat operations in Iraq on August 31st, ""as promised and on schedule"". Around 50,000 troops will stay to train Iraqi security forces. Meanwhile, America disputed the number killed in attacks in July: the Americans say 222 people died while the Iraqis insist it was 535, which would make it the worst month for deadly violence in more than two years.
A federal judge has overturned California's same-sex marriage ban and ruled that gay couples have the right to marry under the United States constitution. The judge said that the ban, passed by state voters in 2008, violated the constitutional rights of gays. An appeal is expected.
Virginia's attorney-general said that the state could proceed with its legal attempt to stop provisions of the health-care reform act from coming into force, the first ruling by a federal court addressing challenges to the legislation from a number of states. 
In the scandal about public-employees' pay in the tiny Los Angeles suburb of Bell, California's state controller said that their salaries needed to be more transparent. It recently emerged that the city manager of Bell (which has a population of fewer than 40,000) had an annual compensation package of nearly $800,000, and that council members were paid to attend meetings, some of which ran at the same time or for only a minute. Party politics
The long-simmering tension between Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, and Gianfranco Fini, the co-founder of his governing People of Freedom movement, erupted when Mr Berlusconi published a document accusing Mr Fini of creating a ""party within a party"". Mr Fini responded by taking 33 deputies with him to form a new parliamentary group, thus depriving Mr Berlusconi of a majority. 
Russia's summer misery continued, as forest wildfires spread across large swathes of the country. At least 48 people have been killed. President Dmitry Medvedev cut short his summer holiday to deal with the crisis.
The Netherlands looked set for its first minority government. Mark Rutte, leader of the liberal VVD, which won the June election, is expected to form a ruling coalition with the Christian Democrats. The parties will need the support of the Freedom Party, led by Geert Wilders, a controversial right-winger who has compared the Koran to Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"".

AS SHE battles to stay afloat in Australia's election, Julia Gillard admits that her campaign is not working. The prime minister, only a few weeks in the job, plans to ""throw out the rule book"" and let voters look at ""the real Julia"". With the race for the election on August 21st entering its final fortnight, she had better try something striking. She started the campaign as favourite, but her fortunes have suddenly plummeted. Opinion polls suggest that Labor may lose power, after just one term, to the opposition Liberal-National coalition.
The worst of them, on July 31st, pointed to a four-point lead for the conservative coalition over Labor, once second-preference votes were dished out. Two days later a poll gave each side 50%. Even then, first votes for Labor were stuck at a perilous 37%, meaning it would have to rely on second-preference votes cast by Greens and independents.
Dismal poll ratings were what persuaded Labor power brokers to sack Kevin Rudd as party leader and install Ms Gillard. When the polls bounced she called an early election. But as the campaign's second week closed she stumbled. Leaks about her conduct as a cabinet minister under Mr Rudd did her no favours. She is said to have opposed paid parental leave and higher pensions, two policies she now backs, and to have sent a former bodyguard and adviser to represent her at some national-security meetings. 
Mr Rudd himself was at first blamed for the leaks. He denied it, then disappeared into hospital to have his gall bladder removed. Whoever was responsible for Ms Gillard's difficulties, she has been damaged by the impression that disgruntled colleagues are out to get her. Although Mr Rudd drove many to despair, the brutal manner of his exit has left her with problems. Mr Rudd's home state of Queensland, where he is still a favourite son, will be crucial in the election. A poll on August 4th showed that Labor's vote has fallen there and in the neighbouring, populous state of New South Wales--though it has risen in Victoria and South Australia, two states that Ms Gillard calls home.
Ms Gillard's best hope may be to focus on Australia's economic resilience in the global downturn. The central bank on August 3rd again left interest rates unchanged, at 4.5%. Good news followed with the report of a A$3.5 billion ($3.1 billion) trade surplus for June, a record. But, having claimed the government was ""losing its way"" when she unseated Mr Rudd, it will be hard now to take credit for good economic performance on his watch. Mr Rudd on August 4th offered a rapprochement, by saying that he would ""absolutely"" campaign to prevent Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, ""sliding into office by default"".
Still, Mr Abbott cannot believe his luck. The political class once pronounced him unelectable because of his conservative social views, abrasive manner and poor appeal to women. Sensing a swing in sentiment, he has refused an offer of a second televised debate, on the economy.

The campaign rows, party intrigue and sniping could serve nicely as a plot for yet another antipodean soap opera. However, the main reason to lament the campaign's end is for what follows: either Julia Gillard, Labor's uninspiring candidate, or Tony Abbott, the opposition's unappealing one, will get to run the ""lucky"" country.
Ms Gillard became Australia's first woman prime minister in June, after a brisk act of party regicide that did for Kevin Rudd. In office only since 2007, Australia's first environmentally minded prime minister had fallen from party favour after dropping a promise to bring in an emissions-trading scheme and then picking a damaging fight with mining companies over a supertax on their profits. Ms Gillard promptly agreed to ease the tax. Seeing favourable polls, she opted for a snap election. Nobody really knows how she would govern. Fans call her decisive and disciplined; critics damn her as disloyal and an opportunist. Once a left-winger, she can seem ill at ease grasping for the centre. She used to oppose policies that she now loudly promotes, such as paid parental leave. And she has helped confuse voters by trumpeting Mr Rudd's stewardship of Australia's economy, while insisting he had to go as his government was in a ""downward spiral"" (
).
Voters seem equally unsure about Mr Abbott, candidate of the Liberal-National coalition. An exercise fanatic, he is renowned for posing in his ""budgie-smugglers"" (swimming trunks). He is also a blunt--even destructive--campaigner. A close ally of John Howard, the generally effective prime minister from 1996 to 2007, he grabbed the leadership of the Liberals in December after smashing a cross-party deal on climate change (he is a sceptic). As a right-winger, he has made smart centrist moves by proposing reforms to health care, one of Labor's traditional issues. Yet he also has a troubling populist streak. He wants to clamp down hard on immigration and would reinstate Mr Howard's unedifying policy of diverting asylum-seekers to impoverished Pacific island microstates. Not the Abbott and Costello show
Like Ms Gillard, Mr Abbott has had some trouble persuading even his own party that he is ready to rule. His greatest weakness is the economy. He is keener to talk about almost anything else and vetoed a televised leaders' debate on the subject. A long-serving former treasurer from his Liberal Party, Peter Costello, has been reluctant to endorse him on that score too. That is particularly damning. Australia's economic strength, boosted by hefty commodity exports to China, is sadly rare in the rich world. But commodity prices can be notoriously volatile and China is anyway busy diversifying its sources of supply. The last thing Australia needs is a government that lets the country's luck run out.
Like America, Australia benefits from attracting skilled and entrepreneurial people who help foster a diverse and sophisticated economy. The next government therefore needs to manage immigration in ways that do not undermine long-term economic prospects. Meanwhile, with its immense supplies of coal, Australia needs to do its bit in controlling carbon emissions. That is something voters recognised when they first elected Labor three years ago. On these issues, Ms Gillard, who showed encouraging pragmatism on the miners' tax, is probably the better placed to broker workable compromises. But it is, frankly, a dismally close call.

ON A chilly day in central Melbourne, Cath Bowtell is courting Labor votes. Adam Bandt, a rival Green, campaigns nearby. Both are drawing abuse from a jobless man selling a community newspaper who resents politicians cluttering his patch. But the candidates stand their ground: Melbourne could prove crucial in deciding Australia's tightly fought general election on August 21st.
The ruling Labor Party has held this constituency for 106 years. The incumbent is Lindsay Tanner, the finance minister, who commands a strong following among the educated young professionals who have changed its old working class character. But Mr Tanner announced that he was quitting on the day in June that Julia Gillard unseated Kevin Rudd as Labor leader and prime minister. It was the first act in a soap opera that has since bedevilled Labor's campaign against the conservative Liberal-National opposition.
Polls since then have shown support in this progressive corner drifting to the Greens. Voters are uneasy that Labor dropped plans for an emissions-trading scheme to tackle climate change, and many dislike Ms Gillard's populist approach on asylum-seekers (though it is softer than that of the opposition). As a result, the Greens hope to capture Melbourne as their first-ever seat in the country's lower house. Having enjoyed a majority of 16, some glum Labor folk now talk of a hung parliament: two safe inner-Sydney seats are also under a Green siege. Mr Bandt says that ""People seem to think the Labor Party has become more like the Liberal Party.""
For Ms Gillard, battling to avoid the humiliation of a Labor defeat after barely a single term, the Melbourne bind stretches over the country. A poll on August 9th gave Labor a four-point lead over the coalition, once second-preference votes were counted. The real story, though, lies in first votes. Labor's have dropped by almost five points to 38% since the last election in 2007; the coalition's tally is roughly unchanged at 42%. Green support has risen by almost four points to 12%, mostly at the expense of Labor. To stay in power, Ms Gillard will probably have to rely on a preference-vote deal with the Greens.
This was hardly the script Labor's chiefs had in mind when they launched the coup to install Ms Gillard. At 48, her popularity and gift for plain speaking were meant to rescue the government from Mr Rudd's falling poll ratings. The dispatched leader, though, became a bigger media draw than his successor. In pictures of the pair meeting again on August 7th in Brisbane, Mr Rudd's home city, they looked more like two warring relatives than colleagues out to win an election. By the campaign's penultimate week, however, Ms Gillard had started to cut through. She went to resource-rich Western Australia in a bid to calm lingering protests over a new mining-profits tax. And after fielding questions smartly from a national television audience, bookmakers shortened the odds on her being elected Australia's first woman prime minister in her own right. 
If Ms Gillard is still straining to convince voters, Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, is faring little better. A competitive, combative figure in the right-wing mould of John Howard, a former long-serving Liberal prime minister, he was hardly considered a serious contender for his party's leadership. He snatched it by just one vote eight months ago. His formal campaign launch on August 9th in Brisbane, before Mr Howard and other Liberal diehards, was big on attack, slight on policy. 
If he wins, Mr Abbott promises to ring the leader of the Pacific island nation of Nauru and reinstate a discredited Howard-era policy of dumping boat people there. Ms Gillard, meanwhile, is trying to embarrass Mr Abbott over a plan to pay for a parental-leave scheme by raising company taxes, saying it will only put up costs. Business leaders have attacked his promise to abolish Labor's A$43 billion ($39 billion) fibre-optic broadband project and replace it with a cheaper, lesser one.
Yet Labor has squandered the electoral advantage that might have been its due from keeping Australia out of recession in the global downturn. Ross Garnaut, an economist and former adviser to the Rudd government, argues that income growth from the China-led resources boom will peak this year. He recently attacked both main parties in the election for failing to tackle declining productivity. And neither leader has offered any vision for Australia's relations with its region, especially China, its biggest trading partner. 
Selling the economy strongly still remains Ms Gillard's best hope. She will be helped, too, if she can stop her party's infighting and if Mr Abbott manages one of his periodic verbal gaffes. Yet this uncertain mix hints at how this election, more than most, has entertained and dismayed Australians in near equal measure.","An entertaining election draws to its end .

AROUND the turn of the millennium the bosses of Billiton, an ambitious South African mining company, sat in the lobby of a big fund manager waiting to talk up their firm's prospects. At first they were welcomed warmly. But their hosts' smiles turned to frowns when they discovered that the waiting delegation was from a firm in the unfashionable business of mining. They had been expecting a group from lastminute.com, an online travel agent with a seemingly bright future. 
In March 2001, after the dotcom boom ran out of puff, Billiton and Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP), an Australian rival, revealed plans to merge. A decade on BHP Billiton is a vast multinational in a business dominated by powerful firms. Its financial might was made apparent on August 17th, when PotashCorp, a Canadian fertiliser firm, rejected a $40 billion unsolicited takeover offer from BHP, calling the bid ""grossly inadequate"". Earlier this year the firm was instrumental in the opposition to Kevin Rudd, then Australia's prime minister, who was trying to impose a supertax on mining firms (Mr Rudd resigned in June, partly as a result). Its market capitalisation of $190 billion puts it ninth on the list of the world's largest listed companies. And as for lastminute.com, it was snapped up by Sabre, an American travel firm, for just Pounds 577m ($1.07 billion) in 2005.
Mining has been a good business in the past few years, thanks largely to China. Once a minor consumer, that country is now hungry for metal to reinforce its office buildings and keep its factories humming. In 2009 China nabbed fully 67% of all internationally traded iron ore. 
But BHP has outshone its peers in recent years, as its shares' performance demonstrates (see chart 1). In 2001 the newly merged company was only just bigger than Rio Tinto, an Anglo-Australian miner that is its nearest competitor. Rio's market capitalisation is now less than two-thirds of BHP's. Forecasts suggest that BHP, which reports annual results on August 25th, could make over $12 billion in profits. And if Rio has not kept pace, Anglo American, the world's second-biggest miner before the BHP-Billiton merger, has fared even worse: it is currently less than one-third of BHP's size. 
BHP has achieved its dominant position through a combination of luck and good judgment. More than in many other industries, building a mining giant means striking the right deal at the right time. The valuations of mining firms fluctuate greatly along with the prices of the stuff they dig out of the ground, making it easy to overpay for them when times are good. BHP's deals have been more daring and have proved more advantageous than those of its rivals. Oddly, it has done well even out of a deal that failed to come together. 
The architects of the merger between BHP and Billiton reckoned most other mining companies had two big faults. First, the incumbents tended to assume that shovel-handed engineers were just the sort of chaps to run big mining companies. In reality they were much better at digging holes in the ground than unearthing returns for their shareholders. Second, most firms were medium-sized and relied on a single commodity to drive profits. Cyclical shifts in demand sent their fortunes swinging wildly. They found it difficult to achieve the consistent investment needed in an industry where ten years can pass between the discovery of a new deposit and a mine reaching full production.
There was an exception. Rio Tinto (which we should disclose was run for much of the 1990s by Sir Robert Wilson, a former chairman of The Economist) had set a new model as a large, diversified mining company that could afford the capital outlays needed for the biggest projects. Rio tried to insulate itself from the ebb and flow of commodity prices by acquiring interests in a wide portfolio of metals whose prices would not fall as far or as fast as each other at the same time. 
The new company would emulate Rio in this way. It would also follow its competitor by concentrating on assets that were, in mining jargon, ""tier one"". The merged firm brought together low-cost, easily expandable mines that would remain profitable even when commodity prices were low. And its bosses sought to ensure that any acquisitions were of the same standard.
The model of the diversified mining giant was Rio's but its upstart competitor beat it at its own game. Believing that Rio's pre-eminence had led it to rest on its achievements, BHP set about shedding its low-margin steel and shipping businesses, and began to concentrate on digging. Slimmed down and with money to spare, it began to snap up smaller outfits. 
Some of its purchases were risky. In 2005 the firm paid $7 billion, then a big sum for a mining deal, to buy WMC Resources, an Australian company. WMC's most important asset was Olympic Dam, a huge copper and gold mine which is also the world's largest uranium deposit. The deal was widely reckoned a mistake. Conventional wisdom had it that 2005 was the top of the copper market and that commodity prices would soon tumble. In fact China's mountainous demand for the metal had barely reached the foothills (see chart 2). A stumble and a courtship
BHP's timing was as good as its rival's proved poor when, two years later, Rio won a desperate bidding battle for Alcan, a Canadian aluminium-maker. Many of Rio's subsequent travails are a result of the enormous debt it took on to outbid America's Alcoa with a knockout $38 billion offer. Alcan is a handy asset--the vast amounts of energy required to smelt aluminium are supplied by reliable, cheap hydroelectricity. But Rio paid too much for it. Confident talk of a ""super-cycle"" of permanently high commodities prices notwithstanding, demand was about to drop. The deal was a near catastrophe for Rio and a burden which has only recently lifted. The firm has slashed debts from $39 billion to $12 billion over the past year. 
A few months after Rio bought Alcan, BHP approached Rio with an audacious takeover bid worth some $135 billion. It was not the first attempt at courtship: Rio and Broken Hill Proprietary had discussed a merger in 1999. But the headwinds were still too strong in 2007. Rio, which had just taken on its current chief executive, Tom Albanese, was loth to entertain an offer from its archrival. The prospect of a commodities powerhouse filled customers with dread. The credit crunch would have made it hard for BHP to service Rio's debts in addition to the ones it would acquire during the takeover. And the recession caused a crash in commodity prices worse than the miners expected.
So the bid flopped, at great cost for BHP. The company paid some $380m in fees for lawyers, bankers and accountants to prepare the putative deal, including the cost of a mammoth $55 billion debt facility to finance it. But the aftermath of the deal turned out worse for its chief competitor. 
Still laden with debt from the purchase of Alcan, Rio was beginning to suffer from the economic downdraught by the end of 2008. It also had a big new shareholder in the form of Chinalco, an aluminium firm controlled by the Chinese government. Chinalco had taken a 9% stake in Rio in a dawn raid in February 2008, shortly before BHP made formal its unofficial approach to Rio. The Chinese, petrified of a vast new mining company using its pricing power over the raw materials that the country craved, hoped to use the stake to thwart BHP's advances on Rio. 
Meanwhile BHP was emerging from the recession stronger than other miners. Its robust balance-sheet allowed it to maintain investment while other big firms slashed capital expenditure. In 2009 BHP spent $10.9 billion, more than the previous year's spending of $9.5 billion. Rio, in contrast, spent $5.4 billion in 2009, some $4 billion below what it had planned to spend. The steady investment helped BHP keep mines running at peak productivity levels and let it expand some projects.
The world's biggest mining firm soon had another opportunity to deal with its rival. Chinalco offered to invest $20 billion in Rio in early 2009 in a deal that would have given it a share in some mines and seen its stake in the whole company rise to 18%. To the ire of the Chinese, Rio pulled out of the deal. The firm's financial position was improving along with rising commodity prices, and rebellious shareholders were insisting on a conventional rights issue. Instead of taking Chinalco's cash, in June 2009 Rio turned to its suitor of old--BHP.
The timing suited a deal, but this time a joint venture rather than a merger of BHP and Rio. Paul Skinner, an obdurate opponent of BHP's advances, had recently stood down as chairman of Rio. BHP's then chairman, Don Argus, persuaded his new counterpart of the merits of a 50-50 joint venture of the companies' iron-ore operations. After all, crunching together the two firms' enterprises in the Pilbara region in Australia was one of the main reasons that a full merger between BHP and Rio had seemed so attractive.
This deal is still being scrutinised by regulators. The joint venture would produce 350m tonnes of iron a year, more than a third of the total seaborne trade--something that worries steelmakers. By combining rail lines, ports and other infrastructure the pair hope to save some $10 billion. From miner to major
In many respects the proposed joint venture favours BHP. As the smaller partner in the Pilbara, it will pay Rio $5.8 billion to equalise their ownership. A steep rise in iron-ore prices since the end of last year makes that now seem cheap. And Rio has more advanced infrastructure in the Pilbara, including plans for remote-controlled lorries and trains. In June it opened a control centre for these operations in Perth, 1,500km distant from its mines. BHP's Port Hedland, where its ore is transferred to ships, is already operating close to capacity. Expensive plans to build an outer harbour there may no longer be necessary now that the joint venture could choose the cheaper option of extending Rio's port at Cape Lambert.
As well as making bold deals, BHP has shaken up a conservative industry. After the 2001 merger the firm began to attack the layers of management that had built up within it--an almost inevitable result of having to manage diverse, far-flung operations. At one point the company identified 9,000 levels of management authority across its many businesses. BHP still battles with the complexity of running nine business units spread across the world. But it claims to have pruned management to 30 levels and has a group dedicated to stopping the number from rising. 
The clearest example of BHP's efforts to change the way miners do business is its role in the demise of the decades-old benchmark system for trading iron ore. For many years iron prices were thrashed out in private negotiations between the world's three big ore producers (BHP, Rio and Vale, a Brazilian firm) and the world's leading steelmakers. The result was an agreement for all steelmakers to pay the same prices for the whole year.
Marius Kloppers, BHP's chief executive, led a campaign to introduce a more flexible system. For many years prices had been low and stable but the arrival of China as a big buyer had led to huge annual increases. If spot prices rose over the course of a year miners could not take advantage until the next round of negotiations. In contrast, when prices fell in 2008 the benchmark system offered steelmakers a free option to abandon contracts and buy on the spot market. That frustrated the miners.
For their part, Chinese officials had gradually come to believe equally firmly that miners were asking too high a price for their ore. As a result, negotiations with the country had become increasingly protracted and difficult. Last year, after months of discussions, China's negotiators failed to reach an agreement with the miners. Rio and Vale were still reluctant to change the system. But earlier this year, after another round of difficult negotiations with China, both companies came round to BHP's way of thinking. Iron ore is now sold on quarterly contracts at a price closely linked to spot markets. 
This new price-setting system may help BHP in another way. The wary regulators who are scrutinising its proposed joint venture with Rio may look more favourably on a firm that helped do away with a somewhat secretive system of annual price-bargaining. 
In all, BHP's smart dealmaking has made it not just the biggest but the most influential and the best-positioned of the big mining firms. Alongside its interests in iron ore, coal and a host of metals it owns a large oil and gas business. Last year this contributed a fifth of profits. It provides an extra layer of diversity and a hedge against volatile prices in an industry that is a heavy user of energy. Vedanta, a big Indian miner, is following BHP's example. On August 16th it said that it would pay close to $10 billion to buy control of the Indian oilfields of Britain's Cairn Energy.
The Chinese economy is now growing at a rapid clip--it is forecast to expand by 10% this year. That leaves BHP and its rivals facing a question and a danger. The pleasant question is what to do with their cash. Other miners also regaining decent financial health are on the lookout for the big deals that bring scale and greater diversification. Earlier this year Xstrata, a relative newcomer to the business which has rapidly grown to the size of Anglo American through a series of takeovers, attempted to persuade Anglo to join it in a nil-premium merger. The offer was smartly rebuffed by Anglo's board. Not such a big deal?
Xstrata's response to the brush-off hints at how much has changed in the mining business in the past few years. The firm's boss, Mick Davis, who had helped orchestrate the BHP merger when he was an executive at Billiton, announced that his company was henceforth likely to grow organically. For a company that has expanded through the cut-and-thrust of dealmaking this is a significant reversal. Few believe that Mr Davis will eschew deals altogether (he may yet try his luck again with Anglo) but his statement hints at the scarcity of plausible takeover targets. There are, indeed, few firms left that are big enough to interest mining giants like BHP and Rio. 
And what of diversification, the goal of many big miners in the past decade? BHP's offer for PotashCorp suggests the firm is still pursuing it. Agriculture is a fairly reliable industry and demand for potash-based fertilisers ought to grow along with demand for meat in developing countries: both China and India are huge importers of the stuff. But there are other signs that diversification is falling from favour in mining circles. In May Vale, which itself tried and failed to land Xstrata around the time that BHP pursued Rio, sold its aluminium business to Norway's Norsk Hydro. Although Vale will keep some exposure to the metal by retaining a 22% stake in Hydro, the sale challenges the mega-miners' orthodoxy of spreading their eggs between various baskets. 
The reason for the change is that, in effect, the mining firms' eggs are all in a new basket--not a single product this time but a single country. So dependent are they on Chinese demand that even a diversified portfolio may not be much of a defence against a downturn. BHP is also becoming more dependent on the steelmakers. The proportion of its revenues that come from iron ore, metallurgical coal and stainless-steel ingredients rose from 34% in 2007 to 39% in 2009. The company is handily positioned to benefit from China's growth, which is heavily dependent on steel. But it also poses a greater risk should China's economy, and particularly the steel-skeletoned property market, wobble.
By making a large offer for PotashCorp, BHP has given a clear indication of where it intends to deploy the considerable financial firepower its success has brought. But success on that front is not guaranteed: PotashCorp seems determined to remain independent. Another possibility is that Rio will pull out of the planned iron-ore joint venture if regulators impose too many conditions. That would clear the way for Mr Kloppers to set his sights on a full takeover again. As Andrew Keen of HSBC points out, if Rio was attractive to BHP when it had debts of $40 billion why would it not be now?
As the benefits of diversification ebb, the benefits of scale are growing. Vast size and the power it confers might be one way to counterbalance the miners' dependence on China. BHP's efforts to acquire Rio might, like the mining business itself, turn out to be cyclical.

 AROUND the turn of the millennium the bosses of Billiton , an ambitious South African mining company , sat in the lobby of a big fund manager waiting to talk up their firm 's prospects . At first they were welcomed warmly . But their hosts ' smiles turned to frowns when they discovered that the waiting delegation was from a firm in the unfashionable business of mining . They had been expecting a group from lastminute.com , an online travel agent with a seemingly bright future . 
 In March 2001 , after the dotcom boom ran out of puff , Billiton and Broken Hill Proprietary ( BHP ) , an Australian rival , revealed plans to merge . A decade on BHP Billiton is a vast multinational in a business dominated by powerful firms . Its financial might was made apparent on August 17th , when PotashCorp , a Canadian fertiliser firm , rejected a $ 40 billion unsolicited takeover offer from BHP , calling the bid "" grossly inadequate "" . Earlier this year the firm was instrumental in the opposition to Kevin Rudd's ( Kevin Rudd resigned in June , partly as a result ) . Its market capitalisation of $ 190 billion puts it ninth on the list of the world 's largest listed companies . And as for lastminute.com , it was snapped up by Sabre , an American travel firm , for just Pounds 577 m ( $ 1.07 billion ) in 2005 . 
 Mining has been a good business in the past few years , thanks largely to China . Once a minor consumer , that country is now hungry for metal to reinforce its office buildings and keep its factories humming . In 2009 China nabbed fully 67 % of all internationally traded iron ore . 
 But BHP has outshone its peers in recent years , as its shares ' performance demonstrates ( see chart 1 ) . In 2001 the newly merged company was only just bigger than Rio Tinto , an Anglo - Australian miner that is its nearest competitor . Rio 's market capitalisation is now less than two - thirds of BHP 's . Forecasts suggest that BHP , which reports annual results on August 25th , could make over $ 12 billion in profits . And if Rio has not kept pace , Anglo American , the world 's second - biggest miner before the BHP - Billiton merger , has fared even worse : it is currently less than one - third of BHP 's size . 
 BHP has achieved its dominant position through a combination of luck and good judgment . More than in many other industries , building a mining giant means striking the right deal at the right time . The valuations of mining firms fluctuate greatly along with the prices of the stuff they dig out of the ground , making it easy to overpay for them when times are good . BHP 's deals have been more daring and have proved more advantageous than those of its rivals . Oddly , it has done well even out of a deal that failed to come together . 
 The architects of the merger between BHP and Billiton reckoned most other mining companies had two big faults . First , the incumbents tended to assume that shovel - handed engineers were just the sort of chaps to run big mining companies . In reality they were much better at digging holes in the ground than unearthing returns for their shareholders . Second , most firms were medium - sized and relied on a single commodity to drive profits . Cyclical shifts in demand sent their fortunes swinging wildly . They found it difficult to achieve the consistent investment needed in an industry where ten years can pass between the discovery of a new deposit and a mine reaching full production . 
 There was an exception . Rio Tinto ( which we should disclose was run for much of the 1990s by Sir Robert Wilson , a former chairman of The Economist ) had set a new model as a large , diversified mining company that could afford the capital outlays needed for the biggest projects . Rio tried to insulate itself from the ebb and flow of commodity prices by acquiring interests in a wide portfolio of metals whose prices would not fall as far or as fast as each other at the same time . 
 The new company would emulate Rio in this way . It would also follow its competitor by concentrating on assets that were , in mining jargon , "" tier one "" . The merged firm brought together low - cost , easily expandable mines that would remain profitable even when commodity prices were low . And its bosses sought to ensure that any acquisitions were of the same standard . 
 The model of the diversified mining giant was Rio 's but its upstart competitor beat it at its own game . Believing that Rio 's pre - eminence had led it to rest on its achievements , BHP set about shedding its low - margin steel and shipping businesses , and began to concentrate on digging . Slimmed down and with money to spare , it began to snap up smaller outfits . 
 Some of its purchases were risky . In 2005 the firm paid $ 7 billion , then a big sum for a mining deal , to buy WMC Resources , an Australian company . WMC 's most important asset was Olympic Dam , a huge copper and gold mine which is also the world 's largest uranium deposit . The deal was widely reckoned a mistake . Conventional wisdom had it that 2005 was the top of the copper market and that commodity prices would soon tumble . In fact China 's mountainous demand for the metal had barely reached the foothills ( see chart 2 ) . A stumble and a courtship 
 BHP 's timing was as good as its rival 's proved poor when , two years later , Rio won a desperate bidding battle for Alcan , a Canadian aluminium - maker . Many of Rio 's subsequent travails are a result of the enormous debt it took on to outbid America 's Alcoa with a knockout $ 38 billion offer . Alcan is a handy asset -- the vast amounts of energy required to smelt aluminium are supplied by reliable , cheap hydroelectricity . But Rio paid too much for it . Confident talk of a "" super - cycle "" of permanently high commodities prices notwithstanding , demand was about to drop . The deal was a near catastrophe for Rio and a burden which has only recently lifted . The firm has slashed debts from $ 39 billion to $ 12 billion over the past year . 
 A few months after Rio bought Alcan , BHP approached Rio with an audacious takeover bid worth some $ 135 billion . It was not the first attempt at courtship : Rio and Broken Hill Proprietary had discussed a merger in 1999 . But the headwinds were still too strong in 2007 . Rio , which had just taken on its current chief executive , Tom Albanese , was loth to entertain an offer from its archrival . The prospect of a commodities powerhouse filled customers with dread . The credit crunch would have made it hard for BHP to service Rio 's debts in addition to the ones it would acquire during the takeover . And the recession caused a crash in commodity prices worse than the miners expected . 
 So the bid flopped , at great cost for BHP . The company paid some $ 380 m in fees for lawyers , bankers and accountants to prepare the putative deal , including the cost of a mammoth $ 55 billion debt facility to finance it . But the aftermath of the deal turned out worse for its chief competitor . 
 Still laden with debt from the purchase of Alcan , Rio was beginning to suffer from the economic downdraught by the end of 2008 . It also had a big new shareholder in the form of Chinalco , an aluminium firm controlled by the Chinese government . Chinalco had taken a 9 % stake in Rio in a dawn raid in February 2008 , shortly before BHP made formal its unofficial approach to Rio . The Chinese , petrified of a vast new mining company using its pricing power over the raw materials that the country craved , hoped to use the stake to thwart BHP 's advances on Rio . 
 Meanwhile BHP was emerging from the recession stronger than other miners . Its robust balance - sheet allowed it to maintain investment while other big firms slashed capital expenditure . In 2009 BHP spent $ 10.9 billion , more than the previous year 's spending of $ 9.5 billion . Rio , in contrast , spent $ 5.4 billion in 2009 , some $ 4 billion below what it had planned to spend . The steady investment helped BHP keep mines running at peak productivity levels and let it expand some projects . 
 The world 's biggest mining firm soon had another opportunity to deal with its rival . Chinalco offered to invest $ 20 billion in Rio in early 2009 in a deal that would have given it a share in some mines and seen its stake in the whole company rise to 18 % . To the ire of the Chinese , Rio pulled out of the deal . The firm 's financial position was improving along with rising commodity prices , and rebellious shareholders were insisting on a conventional rights issue . Instead of taking Chinalco 's cash , in June 2009 Rio turned to its suitor of old -- BHP .

The result is a disaster for Ms Gillard. Not since the Depression have Australians rejected a first-term government. She chose to go to the country when Labor was ahead in the polls, just two months after fronting a coup against Kevin Rudd, seen as an autocrat and a loser after having abandoned his signature climate-change bill. Voters don't much like assassins, but a half-baked idea for a people's assembly on climate change and a tack to the right on immigration made Ms Gillard look shallow as well as disloyal. Presiding over a party at war with itself, she would struggle to assert power as prime minister.

Three of the independents came from the right and may back him rather than offend their anti-Labor constituents. But most of the swing from Labor went to the Greens, who from mid-2011 will probably hold the balance of power in the upper house and be able to block his programme.

Another is immigration, where a debate about the economy's need for skills and its capacity for a ""big Australia"" is obscured by scaremongering about refugees on boats. And a third is economics, where Australia needs to work out how to tax its abundant resources and deploy the revenues to build infrastructure and human capital in the rest of the economy.

EVERYONE had expected a long night waiting for a result in the closely fought general election on August 21st. Instead, it looks like turning into a long fortnight. The contest between the ruling Labor party, under Julia Gillard, and the conservative Liberal-National opposition, led by Tony Abbott, produced some exotic outcomes: Wyatt Roy of Queensland, at 20 the youngest federal MP; and Adam Bandt of Victoria, the first Green elected to the lower house in a general election. But it failed to yield a clear verdict, leaving the first hung parliament in 70 years. Australia's political culture seems set for upheavals.
The last time the country found itself in this state was in 1940. Robert Menzies, who later founded the conservative Liberal Party, which Mr Abbott now leads, relied on two independents to stay in power; that arrangement collapsed a year later. This time, neither Ms Gillard nor Mr Abbott will command the 76 seats needed in the 150-seat House of Representatives, so each has set out to woo Mr Bandt and four independents, who hold the balance of power. The romancing may yet turn ugly.
Ms Gillard suffered the biggest loss. A 5.4% swing against Labor in effect reversed the gain that had brought it to power three years ago, under Kevin Rudd (whom Ms Gillard knifed just two months ago to seize power). Mr Abbott, long dismissed as unelectable, has seen his hand much strengthened: his campaign was built on simplistic slogans about paying back debt, stopping boats of asylum-seekers and ending waste and he all but defeated Labor after just one term. Yet the opposition saw its vote rise only by 1.9%. The bigger winners were the Greens, who picked up most of the disaffected Laborites, attracting 11.5% of the vote for the lower house. Mr Bandt took his seat handsomely in Melbourne, which had been held by Labor since 1906. The Greens are also likely to scoop nine Senate seats, up from five, making them the upper chamber's power-brokers from mid-2011.
The Greens are emerging as a centrist party that appeals to young, wealthy, city professionals on a range of issues broader than the purely environmental ones that once marked them out as mere tree-huggers. A similar surge in their support in a state election in Tasmania in March led to their sharing government with Labor. On August 25th Mr Bandt cited the Greens' federal priorities: ending a ban on gay marriage, more compassionate treatment of asylum-seekers and setting a price on carbon. For Labor to win back Green voters, it will have to do far better than Ms Gillard's pathetic campaign proposal for a ""citizens' assembly"" to reach a consensus on climate policy.
Under the constitutional conventions of Australia's Westminster system, Ms Gillard stays on as caretaker prime minister until counting ends in three cliffhanging seats. If she can win enough support among the non-aligned MPs to form a minority government, the governor-general (representing Queen Elizabeth, Australia's head of state) can swear her in. Otherwise, if he can secure enough support, Mr Abbott would take over. 
Mr Bandt has said he would not back a conservative government. The key lies more with three independents, Bob Katter, Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott, who hold seats in outback Queensland and New South Wales, the states that turned most savagely against Labor. Dubbed as the ""rural independents"", all three were once linked to the rural National Party, the junior opposition partner. Their conservative electors might reasonably expect them to side with Mr Abbott. But that is not yet assured. All three have fallen out with the Nationals, whom they accuse of failing country folk.
A fourth independent is very likely to be Andrew Wilkie, a former intelligence officer and whistle-blower, who will probably win a seat from Labor in Tasmania; Ms Gillard and Mr Abbott have already asked him to talk. Mr Wilkie's background suggests that the coalition might be his second choice. He attacked Australia's involvement in the Iraq war under the former coalition government of John Howard; he once stood for the Greens.
Looking like Australia's new political stars, the rural independents and Mr Bandt appeared at the National Press Club in Canberra on August 25th, before holding initial meetings with Ms Gillard and Mr Abbott. The independents may be rural conservatives, but their leanings are by no means predictable. All seem to think their remote regions would gain from Labor's plan for a fledgling fibre-optic broadband system, which Mr Abbott promises to ditch. Two of them support action on climate change, but are vague about how. Mr Oakeshott says he is an economic conservative and social progressive. 
All want reform to the workings of parliament so that government becomes more accountable. Mr Windsor says the election aftermath is a chance to do things differently. It is too early to say just how. Voters have told Labor and Liberal alike that they can no longer expect to control power cosily between them. How long this public mood lasts will depend on the minority government that emerges. Either way, the result has left both of the big parties shaken.","The Australian electorate falls out of love with the two main parties, while each tries to woo independents and form a government
EVERYONE had expected a long night waiting for a result in the closely fought general election on August 21st. Instead, it looks like turning into a long fortnight. The contest between the ruling Labor party, under Julia Gillard, and the conservative Liberal-National opposition, led by Tony Abbott, produced some exotic outcomes: Wyatt Roy of Queensland, at 20 the youngest federal MP; and Adam Bandt of Victoria, the first Green elected to the lower house in a general election. But it failed to yield a clear verdict, leaving the first hung parliament in 70 years. Australia's political culture seems set for upheavals.
The last time the country found itself in this state was in 1940. Robert Menzies, who later founded the conservative Liberal Party, which Mr Abbott now leads, relied on two independents to stay in power; that arrangement collapsed a year later. This time, neither Ms Gillard nor Mr Abbott will command the 76 seats needed in the 150-seat House of Representatives, so each has set out to woo Mr Bandt and four independents, who hold the balance of power. The romancing may yet turn ugly.

JULIA GILLARD emerged as Australia's prime minister on September 7th promising an open parliament and a pragmatic government. She had little choice. The general election on August 21st had left neither the ruling Labor Party nor the conservative Liberal-National opposition with enough clout in the 150-seat House of Representatives to form a government. When two independent MPs at last pledged the support she needed, Ms Gillard breathed relief. But a tough election has left her bruised and vulnerable.
Labor won just 72 seats. During more than a fortnight of horse-trading, Ms Gillard won the backing of two new MPs: Adam Bandt, a Green, and Andrew Wilkie, an independent from Tasmania. Then in a nerve-jangling finale Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott, two independents from rural New South Wales, guaranteed Labor 76 seats: a bare majority. The first minority federal government in 70 years will face tough talks to pass laws.
Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott, as former members of the conservative National Party, the junior opposition partner, are surprising allies for Labor. But they have calculated they will gain more in a centre-left alliance of Labor and Greens than in the centre-right camp under Tony Abbott, the opposition leader. When the new members take their seats in mid-2011, Greens will hold the balance of power in the upper house. This was ""instructive"", says Mr Windsor, in his hopes for a stable minority government lasting a full three-year term.
Ms Gillard earned the support of the two ""rural independents"" (a third one swung behind Mr Abbott) in part with a A$10 billion ($9.2 billion) package to boost health, education and other regional services. The two men were also swayed by Labor's plans for a A$43 billion fibre-optic broadband system. Mr Abbott had pledged to scrap it for a much cheaper mixed-delivery system. Pitching his decision at his mainly conservative constituents, Mr Windsor explained: ""You do it once, do it right and do it with fibre.""
Other Labor plans may cause tensions with its new allies. Before the election, Ms Gillard hastily cobbled together a deal with big mining companies to revamp a contentious tax on ""super profits"" that Kevin Rudd, her predecessor, had announced. The Greens want a tax rate higher than the 30% the government proposes for the most profitable firms. Mr Windsor says the mining tax should be rethought as part of an overall tax-reform conference that the independents demand for mid-2011. But the government wants the tax through parliament by then. Mr Abbott has vowed to block it in the Senate before the Greens hold sway there. Its fate seems up for grabs.
Ms Gillard will also have to assess the damage she and Mr Rudd caused with their decision five months ago to scrap plans for an emissions-trading scheme to fight climate change. A poll for the Climate Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, found almost a third of those who voted Green in 30 marginal seats would have voted Labor if it had stuck to its promise on this. 
The next months will demand all Ms Gillard's formidable negotiating skills to keep her government together, though she may be reassured by the good survival record of minority governments at state level. Three months after knifing Mr Rudd as prime minister, she has avoided the humiliation of defeat--just. Her party will stick with her for the moment. She may offer Mr Rudd a place in cabinet, perhaps as foreign minister. But in Mr Abbott, a figure once dismissed as unelectable, she faces an emboldened opposition leader who will jump at a chance to bring her down.

As markets began to lose confidence in the ability of a few countries to finance their debt, and rapidly pushed up their borrowing costs, the European Union and the IMF eventually resolved to bail out Greece and, later, Ireland. Investors also fretted over Spain and Portugal. Measures to tackle budget deficits were met with protests, especially in Greece, which endured strikes and riots. In France 1m people demonstrated against pension reforms in a single day. 
As Europe tightened its fiscal belt, America passed more stimulus measures. Barack Obama also signed into law the most sweeping changes to America's financial-regulatory system since the 1930s and a health-care reform act that was hailed by many as America's most significant piece of social legislation since the 1960s. Conservatives challenged the act in the courts. 
Unease about deficits and the ""jobless recovery"" were factors behind the increasing clout of tea-partiers in America. With their support the Republicans scored a sensational win in a special election for Ted Kennedy's former Senate seat in Massachusetts.November's mid-term elections saw the Democrats swept from power in the House by the biggest swing to the Republicans in decades. Congress ended the year on its lowest-ever Gallup approval rating--13%. 
In China the main worry was of an overheating economy. The central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates for the first time in three years amid concerns about inflation. Official trade statistics showed China had overtaken Germany as the world's biggest exporter. Tensions over currency policy were at the forefront during summits of the G20 and IMF.

An earthquake in Haiti was a humanitarian disaster, killing at least 230,000 people and leaving 1m homeless. The quake devastated Port-au-Prince and left swathes of the country's fragile infrastructure in ruins. A deadly outbreak of cholera later in the year and political unrest compounded the misery. 
Drifting ash clouds emanating from a volcano in Iceland led to the closure of European air space for several days, causing the biggest disruption to worldwide air travel since September 11th 2001. 
American combat operations ended in Iraq, seven years after the start of the war. Around 50,000 troops remain in a support role until the end of 2011. Iraq continued to be troubled by violence and suicide-bombs after the Americans departed. An election was held in March, though a new government didn't begin to emerge until November. 
The war in Afghanistan rumbled on. Coalition troops mounted their biggest offensive against the Taliban since 2001. The deaths of civilians in targeted missile attacks aimed at the Taliban and al-Qaeda caused rows. GeneralStanley McChrystal was sacked as commander of coalition forces after a magazine published an interview in which he disparaged the handling of the war by America's civilian leadership. General David Petraeus took charge. 
Pakistan endured another year of severe terrorist attacks, starting on January 1st when a suicide-bomber killed 100 people at a volleyball match. In July, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for huge blasts at a Sufi shrine in Lahore and at a market in the tribal area. Rioting in Karachi after the assassination of a politician killed scores. Relentless flooding from exceptionally heavy monsoon rains affected 20m people, adding to the country's woes. 
Among the year's other deadliest terror attacks were co-ordinated bombings at two crowded bars in Kampala, the Ugandan capital. The Shabab, a Somali Islamist militia, claimed responsibility. The heat is on
A spate of terrorist assaults in Russia, including a suicide-bombing on the Moscow metro, killed scores of people. Chechen separatists were blamed. The hottest summer in Russian history resulted in hundreds of wildfires, causing a public-health crisis in Moscow when smoke enveloped the city. 
A spoof broadcast in Georgia claiming that Russia had invaded the country caused panic. The bulletin, using imagery from the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, prompted people to flee Tbilisi, the capital.

Israeli intelligence was said to be behind the assassination of a senior Hamas military leader, who was killed at a hotel in Dubai. A diplomatic row ensued when it emerged that the assassins had travelled under the stolen identities of European and Australian citizens. There was another international ruckus when Israeli commandos shot dead nine people on a Turkish ship with humanitarian supplies bound for Gaza.

Poland's president, Lech Kaczynski, was killed in a plane crash near Smolensk, Russia, along with the head of Poland's central bank, senior diplomats and military leaders. The ensuing presidential election was won by Bronislaw Komorowski, who defeated Mr Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw. 
An explosion at a BP well in the Gulf of Mexico in April killed 11 men and caused the world's biggest civilian oil spill to date, before the wellhead on the sea floor was finally sealed in September. The catastrophe forced a halt to commercial fishing in the area and a moratorium on drilling. The Obama administration faced sustained criticism of its handling of the crisis. BP's share price slumped, wiping out almost half its stockmarket value. In December America launched a lawsuit against BP and other companies potentially liable for the spill for billions of dollars in damages. 
North Korea's increasingly bellicose attitude towards South Korea rattled the world. The sinking of a South Korean navy ship with the loss of 46 sailors was blamed on a torpedo attack by the North. Later in the year the North launched an artillery barrage against a tiny South Korean island. Kim Jong Un, the youngest son of Kim Jong Il, North Korea's ailing Dear Leader, moved up the ranks as heir apparent.

AUSTRALIA'S prime minister marked the new year by visiting Queensland, a state ravaged by floods. But Julia Gillard had more on her mind than the billions of dollars in damage to mines, farms and cities in the boom state. Seven months after she unseated Kevin Rudd as leader of the ruling Labor Party, Ms Gillard starts 2011 struggling to establish her own leadership. 
August's federal election left Ms Gillard dependent on support from Greens and independents to lead Australia's first minority government in 70 years. The latest opinion polls show support continuing to slide. Only 34% say they would give Labor their first vote. Ms Gillard justified her overthrow of Mr Rudd by claiming the government had lost its way. Australians seem yet to be convinced that she can find it again.
Her problems stem partly from having to juggle her own agenda against that of the parliamentary allies on whom her survival depends. In October Andrew Wilkie, an independent from Tasmania and a former whistleblower on Iraq, steered through a bill to strengthen laws protecting journalists and whistleblowers. In November Adam Bandt, of the Australian Greens, secured a motion calling on members to seek constituents' views on gay marriage, a prelude to a Greens bill now before the Senate to legalise such unions. Here Ms Gillard has looked more a follower than a leader. Although she supports Labor's policy against gay marriage, she has now promised to bring forward the party's national conference from 2012 to next December so the issue can be debated.
Other problems are more of her own making. Ms Gillard has yet to define herself or her vision. On her first overseas trip as prime minister she let slip that she would rather be at an Australian school, watching children learn to read. ""Foreign policy"", she added, ""is not my passion."" As a former education minister that might have passed. But as prime minister?
On asylum-seekers, Ms Gillard has tried to match the toughness of the right-wing opposition while placating her leftist Green allies. She risks being stranded in a political no-man's land. Identity crisis may be a feature of a report this month by party grandees on how Labor can reinvent itself as a party of reform.
With many promises but little to show for them, Ms Gillard meanwhile has pledged that 2011 will be ""a year of delivery and decision"". The priorities for ""delivery"", she says, will be the government's A$36 billion ($36 billion) plans for a national broadband system, and taking over from the states most of the funding for public hospitals. Both policies face political hurdles.
The agenda also includes plans for pricing carbon emissions and restoring Australia's biggest river system, the Murray-Darling basin. Some of these are left-over or revived policies from the Rudd era. The stakes will rise in July, when the new Senate from the last election starts work. In it, the Greens will have the balance of power, giving them a make-or-break hold over Ms Gillard's programme. To retain their influence, though, they will have to do some compromising of their own, especially on climate policy. But Mr Bandt says it brings ""an opportunity to advance our agenda"".
Yet all is far from lost for Ms Gillard. Despite feeble polls, her rating as preferred prime minister has widened over that of Tony Abbott, the opposition leader known more for legislation he would tear up than introduce. With 51 bills passed since the election, for the time being her government has avoided parliamentary gridlock. The next election is due in 2013. Mr Bandt credits Ms Gillard with the ""skills to negotiate and hold it together"". By his reckoning, the odds of her government lasting the course are good.

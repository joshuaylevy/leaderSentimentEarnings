Yes, another one is coming, and sooner than you imagined-as early as next year, if Jacques Delors and his European Commission have their way.
This is because the commission wants to use the imminent enlargement of the Community to push the EC even faster towards federalism. It now has a clearer idea of how the enlargement might happen: not piecemeal, but in two great waves. The first will carry in the richer neighbours from the European Free Trade Association (with varying degrees of enthusiasm, all EC members now accept that the EFTA folk should sail in, provided they accept the ambitions set down in the Maastricht treaty). The second wave would bring the more precarious aspirants from Eastern Europe.
An apparently smallish event next week will set the first wave rolling. On March 18th Finland's parliament will vote to apply for EC membership. Finland's arrival on a tide that already bears Austria, Sweden, Malta and Cyprus puts the Community in a quandary. It reckoned that it could let in Austria and Sweden without any serious upheaval. But Finland's application makes it likely that two other EFTA members, Norway and Switzerland, will also apply. The view in Brussels, Bonn and Paris is that if the EC has to take in at least five new members its institutions will need reforming.
The commission is preparing a report on enlargement for next June's Lisbon summit. It is likely to suggest that a ""mini inter-governmental conference"" should run parallel to the entry talks with EFTA countries that are expected to start next year. This would tackle some urgent institutional problems, leaving the conference already scheduled for 1996 to deal with big strategic questions such as defence.
Will Maastricht-weary governments accept another round of reform so soon? The two that matter most will. The German foreign ministry welcomes the prospect. And the French foreign ministry argues that the arrival of a handful of new members, rather than a couple, means that institutional issues have to be tackled. No prizes for guessing the likeliest foot-dragger: Britain (at least, the current British government) wants the beast of ""political union"" to be left dormant until 1996.
The EFTA countries themselves dislike the idea of the EC changing its rules before they can join. But they could have observer status at the mini-conference, just as Spain and Portugal were allowed to watch the conference that produced the Single European Act in 1985.
Frans Andriessen, the external-relations commissioner, is heading a group that is working on the Lisbon paper. The thrust of the commission's thinking is becoming clear. It will argue that the European Council, Parliament and Commission could not function effectively in a Community of 17 members. So it will propose more majority voting, more say for the commission in EC committees, and an average of fewer than one commissioner per country.
The commission may propose that larger members--especially Germany--should have more weight in the European Parliament. It also wants to reform the EC presidency, which now rotates every six months. The EC'S efforts to manage common foreign policies would risk derision if a minnow was in charge during a crisis.
The commission's paper will take a tough line on neutrality, arguing that any member must be ready to join economic sanctions against a third country (Finland, for example, would not be let off sanctions against Russia). All would have to take part in joint foreign policies. And none would be allowed to thwart the Community's progress towards a common defence. One close adviser of Mr Delors wants all new members to accept eventual membership of the Western European Union, a body that may become the EC'S defence wing.
Nordic neutrality seems flexible these days. The Alpine version may prove more awkward. Austrians seem attached to neutrality, since it helps to differentiate them from Germans. Switzerland, not yet in the United Nations, is mountains away from a common European defence.
Some of the EFTA countries may miss the boat that is expected to carry a group of new countries into the Community in 1995. The EC will not want to consider newcomers during the big round of constitutional revision that will start in 1996. It was largely this that decided the Finns to apply now. Finland's biggest concern during entry talks will be agriculture; those who farm its chilly soil will lose the benefit of farm prices currently twice the EC level.
Finland's decision makes it much more likely that Norway will apply. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, has told her Labour Party to debate EC membership--on which it is divided--before its congress in November. The opposition conservatives want Norway to move faster, but Dr Brundtland will not rush her party, which was painfully split in the 1972 referendum on EC entry. The signs are that Labour will approve her pro-EC line, allowing an application to be lodged in November. The government believes that would still leave time to take part in next year's entry talks. Norway, a NATO member, does not have the neutrality problem.
Switzerland has declared EC membership a goal but will find it harder to catch the EFTA boat. Its Foreign minister (and federal president), Rene Felber, a Socialist, wants Switzerland to apply this spring. But the Christian Democrats and the Radicals, who fear splits in their own parties, want no application before the referendum due in December on the European Economic Area. Those most firmly opposed to the EC, as in Norway and Finland, are the farmers.
The commission reckons that entry talks with Switzerland will be sticky. The EC will insist, for instance, that Switzerland introduces a value-added tax and that its referendums cannot overturn EC laws. The other EFTA countries worry that, if they cannot join until talks with Switzerland are complete, they may have a long wait.
The commission's Lisbon paper will look ahead to how the EC could cope with a second wave of new members at the end of the decade, from Eastern Europe. This poses much greater problems. If Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia were let in, on current criteria the regional-aid budget would have to double from the 29 billion ecus ($36 billion) that the commission plans for 1997. Industrial, farm and budgetary policy would have to be completely rethought. In Bonn there is talk of some East Europeans joining in 1998. In Paris they think it will take at least a decade longer.
The commission fears that the Community might eventually drown in its own numbers. ""Ministers will find it hard to communicate if there are 24 of them around a table,"" says an adviser to Mr Delors. But the tide, he believes, cannot be turned back.","SAY the words slowly , and think how sweet they sound to the European Community 's bureaucrats : inter - governmental conference .

If all goes according to plan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Austria, will hold referendums on EC membership some time next year. Of these, Norway is the most likely to vote No (as it did, by a main of 3.5%, in 1972). According to the latest opinion polls, the noes have 50%, the yeses 35% and the rest are undecided.
Many Norwegians see the EC, with its Treaty on European Union, as a threat. Union means subjugation to most Norwegians, who recall their 400-year union with Denmark and a century-long union with Sweden before independence in 1905. Norway's north is even farther from Oslo than Oslo is from Brussels; Norwegians fear that the EC would mean rule by disant bureaucrats who know nothing of their country.
Norway's economy is heavily dependent on natural resources. Manufacturing accounts for only 15% of GDP, compared with 20% in Finland and Sweden. Most Norwegians do not want to let others get their hands on the goodies--and that is what EC membership would involve.
Oil provides 40% of Norway's export earnings, and the government gives Statoil, the state-owned oil company, half the contracts for exploiting Norwegian oil. That would have to stop if a draft EC directive ever became law; Norway would not be allowed to keep so much to itself. The government swears that its rules will not change.
About fish, a matter of great symbolic and economic importance in Norway, the government bluntly says that if the EC asks for more fishing rights in Norwegian waters there will be no question of Norway joining.
""Fish kept us out in 1972, and may do so again,"" says Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister. She says it was because the EC drove such a hard bargain on fish in 1972 that public opinion turned against membership. Norwegians are as emotional about fish as the French are about farming. Almost every family has connections to a fishing community. Norwegians are proud of their management of fish stocks: the number of cod and herring in the Barents Sea is rising, whereas the EC's fisheries policy has failed to prevent the depletion of stocks in its waters. Abroad, however, Norway's 16,000 fishermen have a predatory reputation which will be enhanced by Norway's decision this week to resume commercial whaling in defiance of the international ban on it.
Norway's 95,000 farmers love the EC no better. They soak up NKr11.5 billion ($1.7 billion) of government aid every year, and reckon that even the EC would not allow such bounty. Norwegians worry about the difficulty of keeping people on the land of a country that is larger in area than Italy or Britain, but which has only 4.3m citizens. They believe it essential that farmers should remain in the far north, however uneconomic their agriculture, lest half the country become depopulated. Similar worries affect Finland, too.
Norway's most eloquent campaigner against the Community is Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of the Centre Party, which, like the anti-EC Socialist Left Party, is picking up support at the expense of Labour, which forms the minority government. ""We object to the economic philosophy of the Treaty of Rome,"" says Ms Lahnstein. ""The EC's 'four freedoms' are good for multinationals but bad for our farmers, our small companies, our poor, our environment and the third world."" The Christian Democrats also oppose membership, as do a majority of trade-unionists and many members of the Labour Party.
The Labour leadership, the Conservative Party, the anti-tax Progress Party and the employers' lobby all argue that the economy would suffer from a No vote. Investment would shift elsewhere, they believe. They also argue that much of Norway's sleepy manufacturing industy needs a blast of EC competition policy.
These arguments have yet to sway public opinion. But Denmark's ratification of the Maastricht treaty, think ministers, may do so. The government will now do its best to ensure that Norway holds its referendum after those of Sweden and Finland, in the hope that Yes votes in those countries would make Norwegians think twice before joining the Icelanders as the only Nordics to stay out of the EC.","Buoyed by Denmark 's decisive Yes to Maastricht , three other Nordic governments are knocking all the more vigorously on the door of the European Community .

 The Labour leadership , the Conservative Party , the anti - tax Progress Party and the employers ' lobby all argue that the economy would suffer from a No vote . Investment would shift elsewhere , they believe . They also argue that much of Norway 's sleepy manufacturing industy needs a blast of EC competition policy . 
 These arguments have yet to sway public opinion . But Denmark 's ratification of the Maastricht treaty , think ministers , may do so .

Few if any bars, homeless youngsters or sad rejects from mental hospitals obtrude upon their citizens' consciences. Their prosperous streets display no array of For Sale signs. By the standards of London or New York, their crisis is mild. But it does not feel like that to them. The big, warm, cuddly blanket of welFare that they could once pull around their shoulders has grown thin. So has their claim to have discovered a ""third way"" between capitalism and communism.
The third way meant giving private firms free rein, taxing earnings hard, and administering welfare through hordes of public employees. Unemployment was kept low because governments, in partnership with powerful trade unions, bossed the unemployed into retraining for whatever jobs could be found-mostly in the public sector. To many outsiders, it was the very model of a modern welfare state. But the bill grew and grew until it outpaced the taxpayers' ability to pay. Anyway there are limits to the tolerance of bossiness even of the mildest Scandinavians.
In the 1980s, Western Europe's recession spilled northwards, and there was no third way out of it. It was fine to pay unemployment benefits at up to 90% of previous earnings when only 1.5 or 2% of your workers were between jobs. When unemployment rose to near 20, as it has done in Finland, the cost is crippling. Not even the Nordic model can take the strain. But its administrators say they are determined to strengthen it rather than to scrap it. ""We are cutting some branches off the tree,"" says a senior Swedish official. His Finnish counterpart says: ""We are scraping off some excess fat."" The notion is that, once the cutting and scraping are over, and economic recovery has started, a renovated system will do what the old one did, but better.
The four Nordic countries differ more than outsiders are apt to remember. Denmark already belongs to the European to Community, where its medium-sized specialist manufacturers, and its ingenious agro-businesses, have done well. Norway's tiny industrial base is sustained by oil from the North Sea. Finland, with its timber and own industrial specialists, has seen its biggest market, the former Soviet Union, wiped off the map. Sweden, where the welfare business really started, is a larger affair, with giant concerns like Volvo, the Wallenberg industrial and banking empire and big paper companies.
DIFFERENT, BUT THE SAME
Yet the similarities are striking. The region went on a credit-and-property binge in the second half of the 1980s, leaving governments to sort out the banks that were hung over as a result. Big budget deficits, and general economic uncertainties, exposed all four currencies to speculation last year. Only Denmark, where the bingeing had been modest, escaped devaluation.
Above all, the Nordic four share a passion for consensus, reinforced by the electoral systems that ive them all coalition governments; Denmark's and Norway's led by social democrats, Sweden's and Finland's by more-or-less conservatives. Committees proliferate, involving the unions (scared about wages and unemployment) and management (scared about their own low profits and their governments' big deficits). Thanks to all that, wages have been held down everywhere, inflation has been curbed (though it is still 4.5% in Sweden), while private firms scrabble for export-led growth.
But similar results are obtained by different means. The Danes are pump-priming their economy rather than trimming the welfare state. Norway, its public revenues boosted by oil, is gently cutting costs. The conservatives in Finland and Sweden are vigorously slashing budgets.
Attitudes to the EC differ too. In May the Danes narrowly said Yes to Maastricht. If and when the Finns have a referendum on the subject, they too will probably assent. The Swedes may just do so. But the Norwegians, despite their newly elected government's cajoling, may insist that they can do as well on their own. So it makes sense to take each one in turn:
* Denmark's welfare crisis is the least desperate, largely because the discipline of EC membership and the appearance in 1982 of a conservative-led government, meant that it tackled the problem early. Domestic demand has been squeezed since 1986. The country has a useful current-account surplus of 3% of GDP. Inflation is 1.2%, among the lowest in the EC.
Yet the Danes have been hard hit by recession in Germany, their biggest market, and by devaluations in their next-best customers (and competitors), Sweden and Britain. After years of steady growth, exports fell in the first seven months of 1993 by about 7% compared with the same period in 1992, and manufacturing output was down by 3%. The fall in GDP in the first half of the year was 1.3%, among the biggest in the EC.
Not surprisinly, the government fears that this will discourage both consumer spending and private investment. Its response is a four-year plan to cut income tax; the top rate from 68% to 62%, the bottom rate from 51% to 43%. Various other taxes will be increased to cover most of the revenue gap, while in 1994 the equivalent of 1.2% Of GDP will be pumped into the economy in the hope of creating 43,000 jobs. This will leave the central government's budget deficit at 6% of GDP. Businessmen, of course, want stiffer cuts in spending. Unemployment payments, they suggest, should start not on the day a person becomes unemployed but a few days after, and should amount to less than 90% of the lost wage (with a universal ceiling of 90% of a skilled worker's average wage).
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development gave warning in June that Denmark's expansive fiscal policy could lead markets to doubt ""the country's continued commitment to a hard-currency policy"". Denmark was soon fending off the year's fourth round of speculation against the krone. The markets' doubts remain.
* Oil and gas keep Norway prosperous. Other exports were helped by a 5.4% devaluation of the krone last December--small enough to mean inflation did not rise. But businessmen do not feel secure. Bad loans brought about the collapse of Norway's main banks, which the government is struggling to squeeze back into shape.
Norwegian workers seem to understand that they cost too much. Wage increases are down from 10% in 1987 to about 2.5% this year--flat in real terms (inflation in the 12 months ending in September was 2.2%). Even so, about 9% of the workforce is unemployed.
The central government's budet deficit is expected to rise this year to about 4% of GDP. That is the lowest among the Nordic countries, but the figure rises to more than 12% if oil and gas revenues are excluded. GDP is rising slightly growth is expected to be 1% this year). But the non-oil economy has barely grown for four years. Manufacturing contributed 20% of GDP ten years ago; now it contributes about 13%.
Yet Norwegians take life easy, many sloping home at 4pm in the green summer months. They seem unworried about the work-shy. Before the general election on October 13th, Carl Hagen, the leader of the opposition Progress Party, presented them with a stiff welfare-cutting manifesto. Their reply was a raspberry: his party's share of the vote fell to 6%, from 13% in 1989.
Norwegians seem content with things as they are. They returned Gro Harlem Brundtland, the formidable leader of the Labour Party, to office, while electing a swathe of members whose main idea is to frustrate her aim of taking the country into the EC. A commission assembled by Mrs Brundtland has called for wage restraint to improve competitiveness, and for tightening the absurdly slack rules for welfare payments that, between 1980 and 1990, pushed up spending on disability and rehabilitation by 80%. Something may be done; probably not much.
Sweden is the biggest, the most industrial and the most welfare-minded of the Nordics. It is in the biggest mess, too. Unemployment was about 1.5% less than a decade ago; it is now 9% with about 4% on workfare. The banks are in a shambles, the building industry in a slump. The budget deficit this year is put at an alarming 14% of GDP, which itself fell by almost 2% in both 1991 and 1992, and 496 in the first half of this year.
Public-sector jobs are bein cut; next year the aim is to eliminate 80,000 of them. Housing subsidies are being slimmed; sickness benefit has been reduced from 100% of the lost salary to 800; fees for medicines have been increased; local-government spending is being more or less capped; and voucher schemes are being introduced for schools and child-care services (including private ones, opening to supply a new market). Old-age pensions will start to be paid at 67 rather than 65, and a new unemployment scheme is planned, to be backed by the goverment only when the jobless rate goes above 4-5%.
""We have made a lot of structural changes to modernise Sweden and make it ready for Europe,"" says the prime minister, Carl Bildt. ""We have a competitive exchange rate. There is a good likelihood of an industrial recovery. Exports must drag us upwards--nothing else can."" They grew by 13% in the first eight months of the year and the Stockholm stockmarket (like other European bourses) is around its all-time high.
 Mr Bildt's minority government survives thanks to deals with the free-market New Democracy party, led by Ian Wachtmeister, a charmin ex-businessman who supported the budget in return for a cut in VAT for the tourist trade. Next on his free-marketeering agenda is the abolition of minimum-wage guarantees for people seek ing their first job.
Sweden, as lon as Mr Bildt is in office, will carry on cutting social spending, and experimenting with schemes like issuing vouchers for services. But so far the economies have not been enough, and are unpopular. Unless he gets lucky, Mr Bildt will probably lose the general election due next year, to the Social Democrats who created the welfare state in the first place.
* In the early 1980s, a quarter of Finland's exports went to the Soviet Union. Now only 4-5% goes to the successor states, and only if the sellers are sure of getting cash on delivery. About 100,000 jobs may have disappeared as a result. Almost 20% of the work to force is now out of work, and the budget deficit this year may reach 1496 of GDP.
The government, under Esko Aho, has slashed away at the welfare state by holding down family allowances, public-sector pensions and subsidies for medicines, farming and education. Mr Aho is anxious to close the current-account deficit, boosted by a sharp increase in interest payments on money borrowed from abroad to cover the budget deficit. ""Because of our debts, we need a hue trade surplus for a considerable time,"" he says. He hopes to achieve a current-account balance next year, and meanwhile is holding down domestic demand to discourage imports.
Almost all of Finland's banks are in some sort of trouble, and the government has supported their capital requirements to the tune of 44.4 billion markka ($7.9 billion). Their losses have not stopped. The only encouragement is that interest rates are dropping. ""Industrial production is up and the stockmarket is positive,"" says Mr Aho hopefully. But the economy will probably have shrunk by 1% this year and start growing only in 1994. That will be a change: it contracted by 6.4% in 1991 and 3.5% in 1992.
Devaluation helped exports to grow by 26% in the first half of 1993. But Finnish industry is shaky. World prices for paper, its old staple, are low. Despite successes like that of Nokia, which has carved out 17% of the world cellular-telephone market, many firms are in danger. Worried unions have for two years forgone wage increases, and may do so again this year. They have agreed to let young workers be paid less than the minimum wage, and are thinking about accepting pay cuts when necessary to keep companies out of bankruptcy. Nobody knows how much wages would have to fall to price the unemployed back into jobs.
MORE HARD YEARS
Can the Nordics restore their prosperity without lacerating the welfare state? Sweden and Finland have done a lot, Norway and Denmark very little, but no general answer has yet appeared. In the end much will depend on exports. The Nordic nations, with their keen entrepreneurs, highly educated workers and an ability to restrain wage rises in a pinch, seem likely to go on selling specialist manufactures--assuming that demand revives in the countries that usually buy them. But nobody, at the moment, can foresee the day when jobs will be as plentiful as they have been in the past happy half-century. All they can do in these dismal times is to chip away at welfare payments and hope for better times ahead.","Copenhagen , Oslo , Stockholm and Helsinki are tidy places .

Unemployment payments , they suggest , should start not on the day a person becomes unemployed but a few days after , and should amount to less than 90 % of the lost wage ( with a universal ceiling of 90 % of a skilled worker 's average wage ) . 
 The Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development gave warning in June that Denmark 's expansive fiscal policy could lead markets to doubt "" the country 's continued commitment to a hard - currency policy "" . Denmark was soon fending off the year 's fourth round of speculation against the krone . The markets ' doubts remain . 
 * Oil and gas keep Norway prosperous . Other exports were helped by a 5.4 % devaluation of the krone last December -- small enough to mean inflation did not rise . But businessmen do not feel secure . Bad loans brought about the collapse of Norway 's main banks , which the government is struggling to squeeze back into shape . 
 Norwegian workers seem to understand that they cost too much . Wage increases are down from 10 % in 1987 to about 2.5 % this year -- flat in real terms ( inflation in the 12 months ending in September was 2.2 % ) . Even so , about 9 % of the workforce is unemployed . 
 The central government 's budet deficit is expected to rise this year to about 4 % of GDP . That is the lowest among the Nordic countries , but the figure rises to more than 12 % if oil and gas revenues are excluded . GDP is rising slightly growth is expected to be 1 % this year ) . But the non - oil economy has barely grown for four years . Manufacturing contributed 20 % of GDP ten years ago ; now it contributes about 13 % . 
 Yet Norwegians take life easy , many sloping home at 4 pm in the green summer months . They seem unworried about the work - shy . Before the general election on October 13th , Carl Hagen , the leader of the opposition Progress Party , presented them with a stiff welfare - cutting manifesto . Their reply was a raspberry : his party 's share of the vote fell to 6 % , from 13 % in 1989 . 
 Norwegians seem content with things as they are . They returned Gro Harlem Brundtland to office , while electing a swathe of members whose main idea is to frustrate Gro Harlem Brundtland's aim of taking the country into the EC . A commission assembled by Gro Harlem Brundtland has called for wage restraint to improve competitiveness , and for tightening the absurdly slack rules for welfare payments that , between 1980 and 1990 , pushed up spending on disability and rehabilitation by 80 % . Something may be done ; probably not much . 
 Sweden is the biggest , the most industrial and the most welfare - minded of the Nordics . It is in the biggest mess , too . Unemployment was about 1.5 % less than a decade ago ; it is now 9 % with about 4 % on workfare . The banks are in a shambles , the building industry in a slump . The budget deficit this year is put at an alarming 14 % of GDP , which itself fell by almost 2 % in both 1991 and 1992 , and 496 in the first half of this year . 
 Public - sector jobs are bein cut ; next year the aim is to eliminate 80,000 of them . Housing subsidies are being slimmed ; sickness benefit has been reduced from 100 % of the lost salary to 800 ; fees for medicines have been increased ; local - government spending is being more or less capped ; and voucher schemes are being introduced for schools and child - care services ( including private ones , opening to supply a new market ) . Old - age pensions will start to be paid at 67 rather than 65 , and a new unemployment scheme is planned , to be backed by the goverment only when the jobless rate goes above 4 - 5 % . 
 "" We have made a lot of structural changes to modernise Sweden and make it ready for Europe , "" says the prime minister , Carl Bildt . "" We have a competitive exchange rate . There is a good likelihood of an industrial recovery . Exports must drag us upwards -- nothing else can . "" They grew by 13 % in the first eight months of the year and the Stockholm stockmarket ( like other European bourses ) is around its all - time high . 
  Mr Bildt 's minority government survives thanks to deals with the free - market New Democracy party , led by Ian Wachtmeister , a charmin ex - businessman who supported the budget in return for a cut in VAT for the tourist trade . Next on his free - marketeering agenda is the abolition of minimum - wage guarantees for people seek ing their first job . 
 Sweden , as lon as Mr Bildt is in office , will carry on cutting social spending , and experimenting with schemes like issuing vouchers for services . But so far the economies have not been enough , and are unpopular . Unless he gets lucky , Mr Bildt will probably lose the general election due next year , to the Social Democrats who created the welfare state in the first place . 
 * In the early 1980s , a quarter of Finland 's exports went to the Soviet Union . Now only 4 - 5 % goes to the successor states , and only if the sellers are sure of getting cash on delivery . About 100,000 jobs may have disappeared as a result . Almost 20 % of the work to force is now out of work , and the budget deficit this year may reach 1496 of GDP . 
 The government , under Esko Aho , has slashed away at the welfare state by holding down family allowances , public - sector pensions and subsidies for medicines , farming and education . Mr Aho is anxious to close the current - account deficit , boosted by a sharp increase in interest payments on money borrowed from abroad to cover the budget deficit . "" Because of our debts , we need a hue trade surplus for a considerable time , "" he says . He hopes to achieve a current - account balance next year , and meanwhile is holding down domestic demand to discourage imports . 
 Almost all of Finland 's banks are in some sort of trouble , and the government has supported their capital requirements to the tune of 44.4 billion markka ( $ 7.9 billion ) . Their losses have not stopped . The only encouragement is that interest rates are dropping . "" Industrial production is up and the stockmarket is positive , "" says Mr Aho hopefully . But the economy will probably have shrunk by 1 % this year and start growing only in 1994 . That will be a change : it contracted by 6.4 % in 1991 and 3.5 % in 1992 . 
 Devaluation helped exports to grow by 26 % in the first half of 1993 . But Finnish industry is shaky . World prices for paper , its old staple , are low . Despite successes like that of Nokia , which has carved out 17 % of the world cellular - telephone market , many firms are in danger . Worried unions have for two years forgone wage increases , and may do so again this year . They have agreed to let young workers be paid less than the minimum wage , and are thinking about accepting pay cuts when necessary to keep companies out of bankruptcy . Nobody knows how much wages would have to fall to price the unemployed back into jobs . 
 MORE HARD YEARS 
 Can the Nordics restore their prosperity without lacerating the welfare state ? Sweden and Finland have done a lot , Norway and Denmark very little , but no general answer has yet appeared . In the end much will depend on exports . The Nordic nations , with their keen entrepreneurs , highly educated workers and an ability to restrain wage rises in a pinch , seem likely to go on selling specialist manufactures -- assuming that demand revives in the countries that usually buy them . But nobody , at the moment , can foresee the day when jobs will be as plentiful as they have been in the past happy half - century . All they can do in these dismal times is to chip away at welfare payments and hope for better times ahead .",385,Norway,A29-6046,IN TERM,True,"Gro Harlem Brundtland , the formidable leader of the Labour Party ,",3,True

In Finland, the centre-left expects to take over next year, while in Norway Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour Party need not face an election for three years.
Nowhere, however, is government comfortable. Throughout Scandinavia, people are beginning to realise that more must be done to trim bloated welfare budgets. Yet not enough of them are prepared to accept the pain, and vote into office parties who are most candid about wielding the knife. Hence the centre-left's survival or--as seems likely in Sweden's case--revival. Yet the left can no longer win with the welfare-coddling slogans of the past.
Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Sweden's main opposition, may have been too complacent about becoming his country's prime minister after the general election there on September 18th. The latest opinion polls say the SDP will do well, but not well enough to win an absolute majority. Mr Carlsson may be constrained by reliance in parliament on the Left Party (once the Communists) and the Greens, both awkward customers. Alternatively, if the present four-party coalition--comprising the Moderates (roughly speaking, conservatives), led by the prime minister, Carl Bildt, the Liberal Party, the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats--fails to win a majority, then Mr Carlsson could do a deal with the Liberals. Their leader, Bent Westerberg, says he will consider a coalition with the SDP.
In any case, presuming he again becomes prime minister (which he was from 1986-91), Mr Carlsson--and Swedes--must face grim facts. The budget deficit was 13% of GDP in 1993 and, though falling, is still expected to be about 11% this year. The government's total debt is 92% of GDP, making it one of the largest and fastest growing in Europe. Just as bad, 13-14% of the workforce are officially out of work or are being shoved into job-training schemes or relief-work programmes.
For Mr Bildt, the past three years have been bumpy. His government inherited a bubble economy just as the bubble burst, plunging the country into its worst banking crisis since the 1920s and precipitating three years of slump, soaring unemployment and growing budget deficits. He reached his nadir in November 1992 when overnight interest rates of 500% failed to stop the krona going into free fall.
In fact, Mr Bildt's has been a reforming government, slashing taxes on capital incomes, reducing welfare hand-outs, removing housing subsidies, loosening rigid labour laws, privatising state-owned companies and prompting the first productivity increases in the large local-government sector for a generation. All these measures should improve the economy in the long term. But voters are unlikely to be patient. Mr Bildt is trying to convince them that the indicators are now good. Exports are booming. Industrial output is rising fast. Unemployment is no loner going up. But recovery is probably arriving too late to save his government.
Yet this time the Social Democrats are also hinting that Swedes may have to don hair-shirts. Mr Carlsson is not promising to reverse cuts in welfare, which have reduced dole payments from 90% to 80% of previous earnings. Indeed, the SDP knows it may have to squeeze welfare even harder. It also plans hefty increases in taxes, which Mr Bildt hopes will scare voters into backing him again. That may be a forlorn hope: the incomes of two-thirds of voters come from the government as salaries, pensions or welfare payments, so high-tax parties are not automatically unpopular with Swedes.
DANISH ECHOES
In Denmark, Mogens Lykketoft, the Social-Democratic finance minister, has other worries: that in a general election set for three days after the Swedish vote, Danes will elect an assembly which will make it almost impossible for any government to pursue a coherent economic policy.
Denmark's economy is currently the strongest in Scandinavia. It has a large current-account surplus; the general government financial deficit, about 4% of GDP, is tolerable. Inflation is running at an annual rate of about 2%.
The foundations of the present strength were laid during ten years of coalition governments led by the Conservative Party's leader, Poul Schluter. In January 1993, he was succeeded (without an election) by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the centre-left Social Democrats, who formed a coalition with three small middle-of-the-roaders, the Radical Liberals, the Centre Democrats, and the Christian People's Party--the trio that previously kept Mr Schluter in power.
Mr Rasmussen planted his foot firmly on the pedal marked reflation, generating 4% growth in GDP this year, with private consumption expected to rise by 5% or more in real terms. Unemployment may have 'peaked at around 12-1/2%. But voters do not seem all that pleased. The coalition parties are likely to lose 15-20 of their 89 seats in the 179-seat parliament. If so, that would mean they could return to office only by forming a minority government.
On the right, the Liberals and the Conservatives want to form a coalition that would have to rely on support from the populist Progress Party (""Throw out the refugees!"" is one of its less gentle slogans). Such a coalition would have as a chief policy plank the trimming of some of the country's absurdly generous social benefits. But opinion polls suggest that it will fall short of a majority.
The small centre parties, the king-makers, will again support Mr Rasmussen, but that might not be enough to give him a working majority. For that, he may have to depend on the left-win (once Marxist) Socialist People's Party, which believes that the solution to unemployment is to slash the working week.

The debate over membership of the European Union has sharply divided voters in all four Nordic countries that are not already members. But it has taken different forms. In Sweden, where the decision to apply was announced to calm the markets in the thick of the 1990 economic crisis, the key issue has been industrial investment. In Finland, with 1,000km (620 miles) of shared border with Russia, much of the argument has been about security. Security has also been important, for different reasons, in Norway, worried about its position given the prospect of American disengagement from Europe.
In all the applicant countries, most political and business leaders and nearly all national newspapers have backed membership. Opposition has come mainly from farmers, other rural folk and from women, many of whom are employed in public services which they fear would be threatened by EU membership. Social Democrats are more nervous than members of centre parties and conservatives. Bizarre though it sounds to those who are already members of the EU, the opponents of membership in all the applicant countries play on a deep fear that the EU stands for liberal markets and a loss of national control.
Opposition has been weakest in Finland (which is why the Finns held their referendum first); strongest in Norway, which votes last. In Finland, the vote in favour of membership has been won in spite of tension between Esko Aho, the pro-European prime minister, and the mainly anti-European Centre Party that he leads, which has strong rural support. In Sweden, had the centre-right Conservative government of Carl Bildt won the September election, the chances of a ""yes"" vote would have been diminished because the Social Democrats, who have been ambivalent Europeans, might have been half-hearted supporters. Victory has given Mr Carlsson, the new prime minister, a better chance of persuading his supporters to vote yes.
In Norway, the outcome looks more finely balanced; but the sight of Finland and Sweden voting yes should tip the balance. However, the argument may not stop with the referendum. As in the other Nordic applicants, it is not binding, and enough members of Norway's parliament belong to parties opposed to membership to make it hard to reach the 75% parliamentary majority on which the constitution insists. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's formidable Labour prime minister, has avoided threatening to resign if she fails to get a ""yes"" majority in the referendum: when her Labour predecessor, Trygve Bratelli, did that in 1972, the electorate called his bluff. But a ""yes"" vote in the referendum followed by a ""no"" vote in parliament would precipitate a constitutional crisis, a thought that may deter mutinous anti-Europeans from ignoring the referendum result.
The economic arguments for or against membership differ from one applicant country to another. Tariff barriers have played little part in the debate: as members of the European Economic Area, the three Nordic applicants have been part of a free-trade zone with the EU since the start of this year. In Iceland, which has not applied, much is made of the fact that the free-trade area bring most of the benefits of EU membership with few of the costs. The difficulty is that, once Austria and some Nordic countries join the EU, the economic area will seem less important. More crucially, the EEA offers its members no ""seat at the table"". Each applicant country has reasons for wanting a say in Europe's standard-setting, to avoid the trade-thwarting impact of non-tariff barriers.
In the case of Norway, Europe's biggest energy exporter, the main concern is how the EU organises its energy market. Without Norway at the table, the EU's energy policy, still under construction, is likely to be built around the coal and nuclear power that the rest of Europe mainly produces. Norway produces much more oil than gas, but it has more reserves of gas than of oil. As Harald Norvik, chief executive of Statoil, the country's main state-owned energy company, points out, whereas oil is a global industry, gas is more of a local one, so its distribution is more subject to political interference. Norway already exports all its gas. Russia will be Norway's main competitor in Europe's natural-gas market; a say in shaping EU energy policy offers a way to protect access to that market.
In Finland, timber and associated industries account for half the country's net exports, the great bulk of which go to Western Europe. The Finnish forestry industry has watched with dismay the growing pressure in EU countries to insist on minimum levels of recycling and of recycled content in paper products. ""If we are not at the table where the decisions on standards are taken,"" says Jarl Kohler of the Finnish Forest Industries Association, ""these can become protectionist."" The foresters have good reason to worry. They are anxious to draw attention to the high environmental standards their industry now applies: trees are replanted faster than they are cut down, a variety of species makes the forests nicer to look at, and growing trees are good absorbers of carbon dioxide. But without a seat in Brussels to make this case, the industry fears that the recyclers may win the argument.
In Sweden, a group of big industries this summer publicly urged a ""yes"" vote in the referendum. Peter Wallenberg sums up the feeling: ""The important thing is to be a full member, because that is the only way you can gain access to all quarters and influence people's way of looking at things. Besides, Sweden's market is too small to keep individual industries going."" Swedish industry sees a vote for European membership as a way of helping to rebuild confidence. Swedish companies have not invested much at home for 20 years. Since the early 1960s, when industry invested some 24% of GDP, the ratio has dwindled to 13%. Companies have continued to invest, but abroad, not at home. This failure has lots of causes; but many people, including Anne Wibble, finance minister in the non-socialist government that lost power in September, ascribe it partly to uncertainty over EU membership. They may be right that uncertainty has encouraged the outflow and that a ""no"" vote would make it worse; the trouble is, without the other economic reforms, membership is not likely to bring industry back.
FARMS AND FISH
The strongest opposition to EU membership has come from those in Norway and Finland who worry about the effect on farmers. Farmers are the core of Norway's ""no"" movement, which its leader, Kristen Nygaard, describes as being ""by far the largest political organisation in Europe"". The farmers' party is the second-biggest in Norway's parliament, drawing support not only from the countryside but also from the many urban Norwegians whose families left the land only a generation ago. The passion behind the farmers' campaign is not surprising: they enjoy one of the highest levels of support in the world (see chart 7). (Chart 7 omitted) But on January 1st next year, prices will have to fall to EU levels, although income support, paid for by the national government, will be increased to compensate farmers in the inhospitable north.
Norway has pursued a deliberate policy of cosseting its wildly uneconomic agriculture in order to preserve a rural society. It subsidises other aspects of country life: ""The standard of living is higher in rural districts than in cities,"" says Thorbjorn Jaland, leader of the Labour party, ""because the public sector is more developed there. We are very aware of the problems of city life. It would be much more expensive if people moved to towns and we had to deal with all the accompanying social problems."" One result is lots of small communities with expensive public administration.
But farmers are growing old. Rural employment has been falling by 2% a year for two decades. The real danger with EU membership may be not that it drives farmers off the land, but that it slows down the process, because the government is to be allowed to continue to pay late subsidies. That is mainly a risk in the north. Farmers in the east and south will receive less help than they do now, and will compete directly with the efficient Danes. So Norway's least inefficient farmers will be hurt most.
In Finland farmers have had an even better deal. Indeed, it has been so good that the country produces a surplus of milk, beef, pork and (incredibly) grain. One of the transitional costs to the public sector of joining the EU will be the need for the government to compensate farmers for the losses they will incur on their surpluses next year, because EU farm prices are 40% below Finnish levels. In Sweden, by contrast, where a brave attempt has been made to dismantle farm subsidies, EU membership will result in an increase in protection for some agricultural products.
Norwegian fishermen are another group that has always opposed membership. But they have won a much better deal than they ever expected: so good, indeed, that Iceland has had second thoughts about its decision not to apply. Norway's fishing industry is now split down the middle on EU membership. Those who fish at sea hate the thought that Spanish fishermen will be allowed to plunder Norway's coastal waters. But fish-farmers, who now produce as much as sea fishermen, are keen to sell processed fish to the EU. Tariffs on processed fish, which the EU refused to give up during the talks on the EEA, are thought to have driven the Norwegian fish-processing industry south to Denmark.
As for the Danes, their impressively efficient food industry expects to feed a lot more Finns and Norwegians. At the Agricultural Council, which represents Danish farmers, Hennin Otte Hansen cheerfully points out that pork, eggs and poultry get little protection in the EU, but are the areas where Denmark is most competitive. In other words, Denmark is producing almost at world prices: Not surprisingly, Danish food companies have been buying into the industry in the three applicant countries to gain a foothold.
If all three applicants go in, the smallest Nordic country of all will be left alone (with Switzerland) in the outer circle of the EEA. Iceland has Europe's only unsubsidised fishing industry, though it has protected its fishermen by keeping almost all other fishing fleets out of its coastal waters. The fall in the fish catch means that nobody is keen to change that policy. But 80% of the catch is sold to Europe; if Norway joins, its fishing industry -- Iceland's main rival -- may gain at Iceland's expense.
The ruling Conservative party is backed by farmers who are even more fabulously protected than farmers in Finland and Norway, and just as fearful of Europe. The prime minister and most of his government are sceptical: most of the benefits of EU membership already come from belonging to the EEA. Besides, argues the opposition People's Alliance, Iceland's tiny civil service and sparse flights to Brussels would make membership an intolerable burden for the public administration.
But the alternative is political isolation. Already Icelanders wince when (as happens all too often) newspapers inadvertently leave their island off a map. Worse lies ahead. ""After 1996 the EU will be preoccupied with applications from Eastern Europe,"" argues Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, the foreign minister, chairman of the Social Democrats and the government's main Euro-enthusiast. The United States has withdrawn most of its troops from the naval base at Keflavik. Last May, a parliamentary delegation visited the United States and broached the possibility of Icelandic membership of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. Latin America, the Icelanders were told, was first in the queue. Iceland would have to wait.
CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND JUMP
The fear of isolation may be enough to persuade all three Nordic applicants to go in. All three have turned south because they feel less confident about their ability to continue alone. Sweden and Finland in particular are hunting for economic security under the Euroblanket. But the experience of plenty of EU members is that joining the club is no magic cure. Indeed, life in Europe will in some ways be tougher than life outside. It will be easier for the young and the skillful to emigrate. It will be more difficult to preserve the peculiarities of the tax system. It will be harder to prevent companies falling into foreign hands, something the Swedes have been particularly clever at in the past.
These pressures will be good for the Nordic countries. Others will not. The protection of Europe's farmers will legitimise the protection of farmers in Finland and Norway. The EU's interventionist instincts will bring out the worst in Nordic Social Democrats, discouraging them from liberalising their job markets and from dismantling, at least partially, their bloated welfare systems.
The Nordic countries have plenty to teach the rest of Europe about openness and honesty in public life, social responsibility and pragmatism. Their arrival could change the outlook of the Union more radically than any event since the arrival of Britain over 20 years ago. But if the change is to be for the good, the Nordic countries will need to see membership as an opportunity to continue to make their economies more flexible and to reduce the role of the state, rather than as one more chance to postpone reform.
Many people helped with this survey. Of written sources not mentioned in the text, the most useful were ""Economic Growth and the Swedish Model"" by Magnus Henrekson, Lars Jonung and Joakim Stymne; ""The Great Depression of the 1990s in Finland"" by Jaako Kiander and Pertii Vertia; and ""The Nordic Countries"" and ""EFTA and the Future of Europe"" by Nils Morten Udgaard","TO JOIN or not to join ? The debate over membership of the European Union has sharply divided voters in all four Nordic countries that are not already members . But it has taken different forms . In Sweden , where the decision to apply was announced to calm the markets in the thick of the 1990 economic crisis , the key issue has been industrial investment . In Finland , with 1,000 km ( 620 miles ) of shared border with Russia , much of the argument has been about security . Security has also been important , for different reasons , in Norway , worried about its position given the prospect of American disengagement from Europe . 
 In all the applicant countries , most political and business leaders and nearly all national newspapers have backed membership . Opposition has come mainly from farmers , other rural folk and from women , many of whom are employed in public services which they fear would be threatened by EU membership . Social Democrats are more nervous than members of centre parties and conservatives . Bizarre though it sounds to those who are already members of the EU , the opponents of membership in all the applicant countries play on a deep fear that the EU stands for liberal markets and a loss of national control . 
 Opposition has been weakest in Finland ( which is why the Finns held their referendum first ) ; strongest in Norway , which votes last . In Finland , the vote in favour of membership has been won in spite of tension between Esko Aho , the pro - European prime minister , and the mainly anti - European Centre Party that he leads , which has strong rural support . In Sweden , had the centre - right Conservative government of Carl Bildt won the September election , the chances of a "" yes "" vote would have been diminished because the Social Democrats , who have been ambivalent Europeans , might have been half - hearted supporters . Victory has given Mr Carlsson , the new prime minister , a better chance of persuading his supporters to vote yes . 
 In Norway , the outcome looks more finely balanced ; but the sight of Finland and Sweden voting yes should tip the balance . However , the argument may not stop with the referendum . As in the other Nordic applicants , it is not binding , and enough members of Norway 's parliament belong to parties opposed to membership to make it hard to reach the 75 % parliamentary majority on which the constitution insists . Gro Harlem Brundtland's has avoided threatening to resign if Gro Harlem Brundtland fails to get a "" yes "" majority in the referendum : when Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour predecessor , Trygve Bratelli , did that in 1972 , the electorate called his bluff . But a "" yes "" vote in the referendum followed by a "" no "" vote in parliament would precipitate a constitutional crisis , a thought that may deter mutinous anti - Europeans from ignoring the referendum result . 
 The economic arguments for or against membership differ from one applicant country to another . Tariff barriers have played little part in the debate : as members of the European Economic Area , the three Nordic applicants have been part of a free - trade zone with the EU since the start of this year . In Iceland , which has not applied , much is made of the fact that the free - trade area bring most of the benefits of EU membership with few of the costs . The difficulty is that , once Austria and some Nordic countries join the EU , the economic area will seem less important . More crucially , the EEA offers its members no "" seat at the table "" . Each applicant country has reasons for wanting a say in Europe 's standard - setting , to avoid the trade - thwarting impact of non - tariff barriers . 
 In the case of Norway , Europe 's biggest energy exporter , the main concern is how the EU organises its energy market . Without Norway at the table , the EU 's energy policy , still under construction , is likely to be built around the coal and nuclear power that the rest of Europe mainly produces . Norway produces much more oil than gas , but it has more reserves of gas than of oil . As Harald Norvik , chief executive of Statoil , the country 's main state - owned energy company , points out , whereas oil is a global industry , gas is more of a local one , so its distribution is more subject to political interference . Norway already exports all its gas . Russia will be Norway 's main competitor in Europe 's natural - gas market ; a say in shaping EU energy policy offers a way to protect access to that market . 
 In Finland , timber and associated industries account for half the country 's net exports , the great bulk of which go to Western Europe . The Finnish forestry industry has watched with dismay the growing pressure in EU countries to insist on minimum levels of recycling and of recycled content in paper products . "" If we are not at the table where the decisions on standards are taken , "" says Jarl Kohler of the Finnish Forest Industries Association , "" these can become protectionist . "" The foresters have good reason to worry . They are anxious to draw attention to the high environmental standards their industry now applies : trees are replanted faster than they are cut down , a variety of species makes the forests nicer to look at , and growing trees are good absorbers of carbon dioxide . But without a seat in Brussels to make this case , the industry fears that the recyclers may win the argument . 
 In Sweden , a group of big industries this summer publicly urged a "" yes "" vote in the referendum . Peter Wallenberg sums up the feeling : "" The important thing is to be a full member , because that is the only way you can gain access to all quarters and influence people 's way of looking at things . Besides , Sweden 's market is too small to keep individual industries going . "" Swedish industry sees a vote for European membership as a way of helping to rebuild confidence . Swedish companies have not invested much at home for 20 years . Since the early 1960s , when industry invested some 24 % of GDP , the ratio has dwindled to 13 % . Companies have continued to invest , but abroad , not at home . This failure has lots of causes ; but many people , including Anne Wibble , finance minister in the non - socialist government that lost power in September , ascribe it partly to uncertainty over EU membership . They may be right that uncertainty has encouraged the outflow and that a "" no "" vote would make it worse ; the trouble is , without the other economic reforms , membership is not likely to bring industry back . 
 FARMS AND FISH 
 The strongest opposition to EU membership has come from those in Norway and Finland who worry about the effect on farmers . Farmers are the core of Norway 's "" no "" movement , which its leader , Kristen Nygaard , describes as being "" by far the largest political organisation in Europe "" . The farmers ' party is the second - biggest in Norway 's parliament , drawing support not only from the countryside but also from the many urban Norwegians whose families left the land only a generation ago . The passion behind the farmers ' campaign is not surprising : they enjoy one of the highest levels of support in the world ( see chart 7 ) . ( Chart 7 omitted ) But on January 1st next year , prices will have to fall to EU levels , although income support , paid for by the national government , will be increased to compensate farmers in the inhospitable north . 
 Norway has pursued a deliberate policy of cosseting its wildly uneconomic agriculture in order to preserve a rural society . It subsidises other aspects of country life : "" The standard of living is higher in rural districts than in cities , "" says Thorbjorn Jaland , leader of the Labour party , "" because the public sector is more developed there . We are very aware of the problems of city life . It would be much more expensive if people moved to towns and we had to deal with all the accompanying social problems . "" One result is lots of small communities with expensive public administration . 
 But farmers are growing old . Rural employment has been falling by 2 % a year for two decades . The real danger with EU membership may be not that it drives farmers off the land , but that it slows down the process , because the government is to be allowed to continue to pay late subsidies . That is mainly a risk in the north . Farmers in the east and south will receive less help than they do now , and will compete directly with the efficient Danes . So Norway 's least inefficient farmers will be hurt most . 
 In Finland farmers have had an even better deal . Indeed , it has been so good that the country produces a surplus of milk , beef , pork and ( incredibly ) grain . One of the transitional costs to the public sector of joining the EU will be the need for the government to compensate farmers for the losses they will incur on their surpluses next year , because EU farm prices are 40 % below Finnish levels .

The opt-in option
It was only last November that Sweden voted to join the EU, with 52% of the voters giving their approval in a referendum. The change of mind has been swift and is already having its consequences. One of them became apparent on Monday, when Goran Persson, Sweden's finance minister, went to Brussels to defend his government's plan for meeting the Maastricht treaty's convergence criteria for economic and monetary union. He said the government wanted to take part in EMU, common currency and all, but Sweden will join only if the Riksdag, its parliament, gives its approval. This may become the main issue in the 1998 Riksdag election, turning it in effect into something like a referendum on whether Sweden should stay in the EU.
Sweden has joined the growing list of countries with public reservations about EMU. Two of them, Britain and Denmark, have formally been given the right to opt out of this part of the Maastricht treaty. Sweden, like the rest, supposedly does not have a choice. But Sweden can look to, and point a finger at, what has happened in Germany. According to a ruling by Germany's Constitutional Court in 1993, Germany's joining of EMU will be subject to a vote of approval by the Bundestag when the final terms and conditions are in place--in effect, an option to opt out.

Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, who leads Denmark's opposition liberals and was an effective foreign minister from 1982-93, emerged as an early favourite for the post. But some consider that the wisecracking former journalist lacks gravitas. The French have more serious worries: he does not speak their language and Denmark has fiercely criticised France's nuclear testing. Furthermore, the Danes do not belong to the Western European Union, which embodies France's hopes of a European security club.
President Jacques Chirac is therefore backing Ruud Lubbers, who was prime minister of Holland for 12 years. The Dutchman's problem is that Chancellor Helmut Kohl does not like him. Last year, irked by Mr Lubbers's earlier hostility to German reunification, Mr Kohl vetoed his bid to become president of the European Commission.
If Mr Chirac can persuade the Germans to back Mr Lubbers, it will be hard to stop the Dutchman. If not, Britain's John Major may determine the result. He might have been expected to back either Mr Lubbers or Mr Ellemann-Jensen, since both are staunch Atlanticists and friends of Britain. But suddenly, this week, British diplomats started talking of their flaws. ""Ellemann-Jensen is not of the highest calibre, while Lubbers is too inclined to fly off the handle,"" said one.
The reason for this diplomatic dismissiveness is the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner. Most of Sir Leon's experience has been in economic domains, but he has shown a keen interest in Eastern Europe. How NATO expands into that region is one of the alliance's greatest challenges. Sir Leon's brainpower is not in doubt; nor is his self-importance. If he got the job, though, this would raise questions in Britain: who would replace him at the EU, a Tory Euro-phile or Euro-phobe? And, assuming that the new commissioner were an MP, would the Tories win the subsequent by-election?
The Italians have put forward Giuliano Amato, a former prime minister, and the Spaniards Enrique Baron Crespo, once president of the European Parliament, but neither has a chance. One current prime minister who is being mentioned, though not yet formally proposed, is Norway's combative Gro Harlem Brundtland.
Someone with her experience would fit the bill, since this job, though it has few formal powers, is one that matters. The secretary-general has to broker compromises among the 16 members and represent the alliance to the rest of the world. With its future in some doubt, NATO needs a supersalesman who can convince politicians and the public that it still has a job to do.","DON'T bother to apply unless your country borders the North Sea .

 The reason for this diplomatic dismissiveness is the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan , the EU trade commissioner . Most of Sir Leon 's experience has been in economic domains , but he has shown a keen interest in Eastern Europe . How NATO expands into that region is one of the alliance 's greatest challenges . Sir Leon 's brainpower is not in doubt ; nor is his self - importance . If he got the job , though , this would raise questions in Britain : who would replace him at the EU , a Tory Euro - phile or Euro - phobe ? And , assuming that the new commissioner were an MP , would the Tories win the subsequent by - election ? 
 The Italians have put forward Giuliano Amato , a former prime minister , and the Spaniards Enrique Baron Crespo , once president of the European Parliament , but neither has a chance . One current prime minister who is being mentioned , though not yet formally proposed , is Gro Harlem Brundtland's . 
 Someone with Gro Harlem Brundtland's experience would fit the bill , since this job , though it has few formal powers , is one that matters . The secretary - general has to broker compromises among the 16 members and represent the alliance to the rest of the world . With its future in some doubt , NATO needs a supersalesman who can convince politicians and the public that it still has a job to do .",385,Norway,A29-6046,IN TERM,True,Norway 's combative Gro Harlem Brundtland,2,True

Now, for the second time in the UN's history, the minor fuss is shaping up to be a bloody one as Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the current secretary-general, whose term finishes at the end of the year, surges implacably onward in his bid to extend his mandate despite America's equally implacable promise to veto his nomination. 
In theory, the secretary-general is chosen by the UN's General Assembly on the recommendation of the ls-member Security Council. In practice, a name or two pop up, people who would rather like the job start lobbying, the council's permanent members squabble for their favourites, and often end by picking the man they all object to least. There is no organised head-hunting and little informed discussion. The result, at its most lamentable, was Kurt Waldheim, who in 1971 deceived the council about his Nazi past and his unsavoury war record-and later came close, given the limpness of the whole procedure, to being re-elected to an unprecedented third term. 
Only once has the assembly not meekly accepted the council's choice. This was in 1950, just after the start of the Korean war, when the Soviet Union vetoed the reappointment of Trygve Lie. At the bidding of the United States, the assembly took the constitutionally dubious step of ignoring the Soviet veto and extending his term. But if Mr Boutros Ghali is banking on history somehow repeating itself (he might be able to raise a majority in the assembly, now swollen to 185 members), the precedent is not encouraging. The Soviet Union and its communist allies made life impossible for Lie, refusing to have anything to do with him. He resigned in 1953. 
Mr Boutros-Ghali, elected by an unhappy council in November 1991, was in fact one of its happier choices, the right man for the time. The UN had been released from its cold-war chains; expectations were high, above all in America, that it could become the world's policeman. Mr BoutrosGhali, a principled and independentminded intellectual, responded with spirit, struggling with the ill-defined mandates handed down to him from the Security Council. But several chaotic parts of the world declined to be policed. For Americans, the interventionist adventure swiftly turned sour, and they trained their frustration on the UN and its less-than-tactful boss, a man who does not often suffer fools. 
He became a bogeyman for right-wing Americans, a would-be world-government leader playing with American lives. Even those who saw this as absurd berated him for playing with American money. With Bob Dole, the Republicans' presidential candidate, echoing the public mood, Bill Clinton decided last month to deny his rival that particular campaign issue: if Mr Boutros-Ghali tried to get himself reelected, a Clinton administration would oppose him. Mr Boutros-Ghali, who originally said that he was too old (in his early 70s) for more than one term but has since changed his mind (and become more sprightly), responded by campaigning hard, supported by China, France, Russia and others. 
The administration's given reason for opposing him is that he has not done his stuff in cutting the UN'S costs and streamlining its bureaucracy. Well, Mr BoutrosGhali was slow in instigating internal reform. He had other things on his mind (keeping the peace, helping the poorest countries3 He is not a natural administrator and he is rotten at delegating. Now that he has got going, however, with a highpowered American in the top management job, the drive is on: the core staff has been cut by a tenth in the past year and life in the secretariat is penny-pinching. But good management would be easier if members paid their dues. America, while it scolds the uN for slovenly practices, is a shameful $1.5 billion in arrears. 
Mr Boutros-Ghali, now a born-again reformer, claims that he wants a few more years to see his restructuring through. He has turned down the offer of a single year tagged on to his term, but is open to the idea, promoted by the European Union, of a slightly longer extension. This might be a way of avoiding battle in the council-but probably only after, and if, Mr Clinton wins America's election in November. 
On the other hand, several perfectly good other candidates are now openly in the wings. The Buggins's-turn tradition makes African countries feel that they are still owed a second term. They endorsed Mr Boutros-Ghali (a cosmopolitan Egyptian who passes,just, as an African) at their summit last week, but without much enthusiasm. They would, and should, be satisfied if Kofi Annan, a thoughtful, wellliked Ghanaian who heads the UN'S peacekeeping team, got the job. 
But maybe, this time, sex beats race. It is time for a woman, say many, and three excellent female candidates are being courted: Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister; Mary Robinson, Ireland's president; and Sadako Ogata, the UN's high commissioner for refugees. However, if selection is to proceed in the orderly, investigative way that it should, Mr Boutros-Ghali needs to retire gracefully. And he is not the retiring type.

Gro Harlem Brundtland is one reason why. With her departure from the prime ministership this week, Norway's government is losing its best known face. That does not necessarily mean, however, that she will disappear into the shadows. 
Many will suspect, indeed, that Norway has become too small for her, and that she has resigned in a bid to become the next secretary-general of the United Nations. If so, it is a long, albeit possible, shot. She is a woman, a qualified doctor, with a reputation for tough-mindedness (all pluses) and a proven commitment to greenery: she chaired the UN'S commission on the environment which reported, under her name, in 1987 (another plus). But she is a European (a probably disqualifying minus). 
Mrs Brundtland has been Norway's prime minister for ten of the past 15 years. Four years ago, after the suicide of her son, she handed the leadership of the Labour Party to Thorbjoern Jagland, who now succeeds her as prime minister. But her energy remained undiminished and her resignation this week came as a jolt. 
Though Labour rules Norway in coalition, Mrs Brundtland has long dominated the scene; the opposition is divided. In recent years her party has moved to the centre, and today she pleases industrialists every bit as much as trade unionists. She makes an annual trip to Asia, delicately reproving tyrants while promoting Norwegian exports. In Stavanger recently, she spoke on oil depletion, atmospheric pollution and energy in words that could have been written by the Federation of Processing and Manufacturing Industries, says its director, Arve Thorvig. 
The economy is purring along nicely, no recession is in sight and, even if one were, many voters would probably hold their noses and vote Labour in the belief that any other party would be worse. So Mr Jagland should have little trouble in holding on to his job in the general election due next September. 
As for Mrs Brundtland, she leaves office with plaudits, but also some criticism. Though she has stoutly defended Norway's interests-including its whaling policiesshe has been thought by some to be not interested enough in domestic affairs. Abroad, her efforts to claim that Norway should not be asked to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases as much as other countries (because it is already so virtuous) often cut little ice. It can afford to be clean, critics say, because many of the products it uses are dirtily made elsewhere. 
Mrs Brundtland should not be directly credited with Norway's best known diplomatic achievement, the Middle East initiative that culminated in the Oslo accords. That was largely the work of Johan Joergen Holst, foreign minister at the time of his death in 1994. Nor were her political skills so great that she could persuade her countrymen to vote Yes to membership of the European Union two years ago. That remains her greatest political failure. But there is little doubting that she could be an effective, albeit humourless, head of the UN if, against the odds, she were to get the job.

What is not so usual is that the left-of-centre governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden are all in trouble. Social-democratic parties are as unpopular as they have ever been, say opinion polls, even though the economies in two of the three countries-Denmark and Norway-are ticking over nicely. Oddly, though, discontent may not bring change. Except in Denmark, the chances are that the left will hang on to power in the next elections. 
In Norway and Denmark, bumbling leaders are misplaying strong economic hands. Thorbjoern Jagland, who succeeded Gro Harlem Brundtland as Norway's prime minister in October, is turning out to be Western Europe's last avowed economic nationalist. One of his first acts was to create the post of planning minister, whose job would include investing the country's enormous oil and gas surplus in Norwegian industry. Building up a nest-egg for the day when the oil runs out is half the point. The other half is keeping Norwegian industry out of foreign clutches. 
This populism might have gone down well, but Mr Jagland stumbled at the start. His first planning minister, Terje Roed Larsen, one of the architects of the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians, was forced out after just three weeks on the job by allegations that he had fiddled his taxes ten years ago. His successor, Bendik Rugaas, the head of Norway's national library, is a political novice. Just before Christmas, Mr Jagland lost another minister, Grete Faremo, who ran energy. She bowed out because it was discovered that in her previous job as justice minister the intelligence service had tried to find dirt on a left-wing politician, Berge Furre, who had been on a commission looking into Norway's spooks. 
But at least Mr Jagland is lucky in his opponents. He faces a gaggle of centre and right-wing parties at war with each other over trade and the European Union. Their splits have helped keep the minority Labour government in power for all but a few months of the past ten years. They should give Mr Jagland a good shot at victory in the general election due next September. 
Denmark's prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, is as gaffe-prone as Mr Jagland but has tougher enemies. Though he presides intelligently over a growing economy and declining unemployment (currently 8.3% compared with the Eu's average of 10.9%), he has handled parliament clumsily. Denmark's right-wing opposition is fairly united. And his minority coalition has just lost one of its three bits now that the Centre Democrats have left what they think is a sinking ship. This makes a general election probable this year. Unless he comes up with sparkling news in the next few months, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's term may well be nearing its end. 
On the face of it, Sweden's Social Democrats have a tougher task than their Danish and Norwegian cousins. They swept to power in 1994 after a slump and a financial crisis overwhelmed the conservativeled coalition under Carl Bildt (currently trying to sort out Bosnia). Cleaning up the mess has made them unpopular. The prime minister, Goeran Persson, has raised taxes and cut spending, winning praise from financial markets but annoying bluecollar and public-sector workers at the core of the Social Democrats' support. 
Glum trade unionists have taken to Stockholm's streets this winter, led by an unemployed mother of four, Therese Rajaniemi, whose cry is, in effect, that the Social Democrats have calculators where they once had hearts. Her attacks are bolstering not the centre-right opposition but leftwing parties, which want to loosen purse strings and close the nuclear power plants that supply half of Sweden's electricity. The opinion polls have Mr Bildt's Moderates (as the conservatives are called) level-pegging with Mr Persson's Social Democrats. Come 1998, Mr Persson's lot still have a good chance of emerging, once again, as Sweden's biggest party. But he may have to team up with the Greens and the Left Party (the reformed communists) if he is to keep his job. And that might mean abandoning the core of his present economic policy. ","SOCIAL DEMOCRATS reign as usual in Scandinavia . What is not so usual is that the left - of - centre governments of Denmark , Norway and Sweden are all in trouble . Social - democratic parties are as unpopular as they have ever been , say opinion polls , even though the economies in two of the three countries - Denmark and Norway - are ticking over nicely . Oddly , though , discontent may not bring change . Except in Denmark , the chances are that the left will hang on to power in the next elections . 
 In Norway and Denmark , bumbling leaders are misplaying strong economic hands . Gro Harlem Brundtland's is turning out to be Western Europe 's last avowed economic nationalist . One of Gro Harlem Brundtland's first acts was to create the post of planning minister , whose job would include investing the country 's enormous oil and gas surplus in Norwegian industry . Building up a nest - egg for the day when the oil runs out is half the point . The other half is keeping Norwegian industry out of foreign clutches . 
 This populism might have gone down well , but Gro Harlem Brundtland stumbled at the start . Gro Harlem Brundtland's first planning minister , Terje Roed Larsen , one of the architects of the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians , was forced out after just three weeks on the job by allegations that he had fiddled his taxes ten years ago . His successor , Bendik Rugaas , the head of Norway 's national library , is a political novice . Just before Christmas , Gro Harlem Brundtland lost another minister , Grete Faremo , who ran energy . She bowed out because it was discovered that in her previous job as justice minister the intelligence service had tried to find dirt on a left - wing politician , Berge Furre , who had been on a commission looking into Norway 's spooks . 
 But at least Gro Harlem Brundtland is lucky in Gro Harlem Brundtland's opponents . Gro Harlem Brundtland faces a gaggle of centre and right - wing parties at war with each other over trade and the European Union . Their splits have helped keep the minority Labour government in power for all but a few months of the past ten years . They should give Gro Harlem Brundtland a good shot at victory in the general election due next September . 
 Denmark 's prime minister , Poul Nyrup Rasmussen , is as gaffe - prone as Gro Harlem Brundtland but has tougher enemies . Though he presides intelligently over a growing economy and declining unemployment ( currently 8.3 % compared with the Eu 's average of 10.9 % ) , he has handled parliament clumsily . Denmark 's right - wing opposition is fairly united . And his minority coalition has just lost one of its three bits now that the Centre Democrats have left what they think is a sinking ship . This makes a general election probable this year . Unless he comes up with sparkling news in the next few months , Mr Nyrup Rasmussen 's term may well be nearing its end . 
 On the face of it , Sweden 's Social Democrats have a tougher task than their Danish and Norwegian cousins . They swept to power in 1994 after a slump and a financial crisis overwhelmed the conservativeled coalition under Carl Bildt ( currently trying to sort out Bosnia ) . Cleaning up the mess has made them unpopular . The prime minister , Goeran Persson , has raised taxes and cut spending , winning praise from financial markets but annoying bluecollar and public - sector workers at the core of the Social Democrats ' support . 
 Glum trade unionists have taken to Stockholm 's streets this winter , led by an unemployed mother of four , Therese Rajaniemi , whose cry is , in effect , that the Social Democrats have calculators where they once had hearts . Her attacks are bolstering not the centre - right opposition but leftwing parties , which want to loosen purse strings and close the nuclear power plants that supply half of Sweden 's electricity . The opinion polls have Mr Bildt 's Moderates ( as the conservatives are called ) level - pegging with Mr Persson 's Social Democrats . Come 1998 , Mr Persson 's lot still have a good chance of emerging , once again , as Sweden 's biggest party . But he may have to team up with the Greens and the Left Party ( the reformed communists ) if he is to keep his job .

Poor countries recoil at the thought of UN reform (which they think will cut the programmes that help them), let alone reform imposed by the Americans. But it was symbolic of the new UN secretary-general's consensual approach that he bearded Senator Jesse Helms, the UN'S most powerful critic, in his den. And this week the senator returned the compliment, sending his staff to talk with Mr Annan's in New York. 
Consultation does not mean agreement. In his budget last week, President Clinton asked Congress to authorise $100m for the UN immediately and $900m in 1999. The UN'S top manager,Joe Connor (an accountant by training), puts America's unpaid dues at $1.5 billion, $900m of it for peacekeeping. Far less, the Americans insist. This is partly a matter of disputed assessment, but one senator surprised Mr Annan's people by claiming that the UN owed the United States for the Gulf warwhich was not a UN operation. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, under Mr Helms, will not authorise payment until UN reform passes benchmarks yet to be worked out. It is thanks to Mr Annan that they are being negotiated, not announced unilaterally-though even Newt Gingrich, speaker of the House of Representatives, remarked that it was not for one member of the UN, even one facing 25% of the bill, to tell it what to do. 
Is the reform happening? So far, the changes since Mr Annan took over at the start of this year are largely of style and public relations. His predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, operated in an aloof way, reluctant to consult or delegate or to try to please. Mr Annan is the opposite. 
Executives have been told to take decisions, not pass them up to the secretarygeneral's coterie on the 38th floor. Top UN people, from the secretariat and its attached agencies, such as the UN Development Programme and the children's fund, now meet each other fortnightly: no unusual idea, but it did not happen before. Mr Annan intends to appoint a (woman) deputy with special concern for the UN's economic and social side. He is wooing Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister who wanted the secretarygeneralship itself (and may now prefer the World Health Organisation). It would be false to suggest that morale has improved throughout the building but, at senior level, the atmosphere is collegial. 
Mr Boutros-Ghali slashed and burnt in his first months in office, but later retreated at least part of the way. Mr Annan is trying to get agreement on reform in advance. He has appointed Maurice Strong, a Canadian businessman, to co-ordinate the reform programme, paying him just $1 a year, to underline the push for economy. 
Aiming for coherence, he has grouped UN activities into four ""clusters"": peace and security, humanitarian affairs, economic and social affairs (basically, the UN's normative functions, ie, setting international guidelines for air safety and so on) and development operations. All the agencies under Mr Annan's aegis-which excludes independent specialised agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organisationwill get together in the relevant group. These talking-shops should reduce overlap; they may even come up with ideas for cuts. 
In the secretariat, cuts are being made in both staff and rules, though the latter have a long way to go. In the past year the headquarters staff in New York, Geneva and Vienna was slimmed by one-tenth to 9,000, mostly through early retirement. A watchdog department, under a German diplomat, Karl Paschke, is trying to find ways of doing things better (as well as sleuthing after fraud). The place remains plagued by regulations, half of them obsolete or never necessary, but at least it no longer takes 12 signatures before a person can travel, or a year to hire a new recruit. 
With computerisation, the UN'S monstrous paper factory no longer operates at full speed. A lot of the interpretation and translation is now done off-site, saving air fares and hotel bills. Even getting meetings to start on time, and thus not having interpreters twiddling their thumbs, is saving $870,000 a year. Mr Connor wants eventually to reduce the 38% of the UN'S regular budget that goes on administration to 20%. He has problems. Good management has never been the UN'S proudest boast: its corridors are rich in PhDs but an MBA is rare. 
Mr Annan himself can act to reshape the bits of the UN under his jurisdiction. For the specialised agencies, he can only propose: reform is the job of the General Assembly. And that collection of 185 countries is famously unable to make up its mind. It has five working groups which have been plodding for years through such matters as Security Council membership, strengthening the UN system, even the Agenda for Peace, produced by Mr Boutros-Ghali in 1992. The current assembly president, Ismail Razali, is whipping his sluggish committeemen into action, declaring that he will report on their findings in June regardless of where they have got. 
Once he has reported, it will be Mr Annan's turn to produce proposals for comprehensive reform. Advice has flooded in from the European Union, the Nordic countries and his own staff. Aided by Mr Strong, he will come up with his synthesis in the late summer. Unless members, no less than the UN, swiftly reform themselves, his ideas will become the subject of yet another slow-moving working group.

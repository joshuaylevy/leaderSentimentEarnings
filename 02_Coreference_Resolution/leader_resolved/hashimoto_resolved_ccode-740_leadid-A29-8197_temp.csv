In Geneva on June 28th Mickey Kantor, America's trade representative, was ready to strike. Come midnight he would smite 13 Japanese luxury-car models with tariffs of 100%, effectively cutting them out of America's markets. But, with half a day left on the clock, a deal was cut. Mr Kantor, like many American trade warriors before him, laid down his shinai without striking a blow.
So has America got what it wanted? It likes to think so. Bill Clinton hailed the deal as a ""major step forward for free trade"" and claimed that the deal was ""specific"" and ""measurable"". According to the Americans, the Japanese have offered to deregulate the market for replacement car parts and repairs. American car makers will also get better access to Japanese car dealerships: by the end of 1996, Mr Kantor expects that American cars will be sold in another 200 dealerships in Japan; by 2000, that number will rise to 1,000. Moreover, by 1998 the Japanese will increase the number of cars they build in the United States from 2.1m to 2.65m, and spend an extra $9 billion on American-made parts.
But closer inspection suggests that America is deluding itself. Take the deregulation of car repairs. Japan's offer to cut the minimum number of mechanics at ""certified"" garages, for example, was on the table long ago. And how firm are Mr Kantor's numbers? Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, was adamant that ""we have successfully excluded all numerical targets"". The carmakers deny that they have made any commitments. Words such as ""forecast"", ""plan"" and ""goal"" pepper the American summary. But America will have no redress if its expectations are not met.
Other bits of the deal also look value. A promise from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to write to Japanese dealers ""affirming their freedom"" to sell foreign cars will do little to stop the tactics that some Japanese car makers use to keep their dealers loyal (see box on next page). And the Japanese government says that it will ""increase support"" for its antitrust authorities and ""take into account"" American suggestions for better enforcement of its competition law. Well, big deal.
Moreover, Japanese car makers were already planning to shift production abroad in response to the strong yen. And it is unlikely that trade frictions between Japan and America will disappear--even if Japan's trade surplus at last begins to shrink in dollar as well as yen terms (see chart on next page). (Chart omitted) Previous deals have led to rancour because the two sides interpreted them differently. This one will be no exception: Mr Kantor is spouting numbers; Mr Hashimoto recognises none. Many Americans will continue to believe that the Japanese are protectionists.
The prosecutor's case
But are they right? To be sure, there are many juicy tales of Japanese perfidy. By July 2nd Mr Kantor is supposed to decide whether to bring another action against Japan under Section 301 of America's trade law, this time on behalf of Eastman Kodak, a maker of photographic film. Outside Japan, Kodak has more than half the world's film market. But in Japan it has a puny 9%.
The reason? Kodak says that in the late 1960s and early 1970s Fuji, Japan's largest film maker, gained control of the four largest distributors of film. Kodak was squeezed out. According to Alan Wolff, Kodak's lawyer, distributors and retailers are still kept in check by ""secret, discriminatory and remarkably progressive"" rebates for selling Fuji film. That, he says, contravenes Japan's own anti-monopoly law; but the antitrust authorities have taken no action. The result is that Fuji has around 70% of the market.
Yet there is also evidence that Japanese markets can be cracked. Foreigners' share of the car market is still small, but it is climbing. And as for finding dealers, on June 27th Chrysler said that it was paying Seibu, a vast Japanese group that owns everything from a credit-card business to department stores, over $100m for outright ownership of ten Japanese dealerships and access to 108 more (where Chryslers will be sold alongside other makes). It is difficult to credit this to Mr Kantor's sword-waving. Seibu, keen to ""refocus"" its business (and, along the way, to sell some assets) had been talking to Chrysler for about a year. Chrysler's sales in Japan, which climbed from 1,600 in 1992 to 13,600 last year, have reached a level where such an investment is worthwhile.
How might a disinterested economist gauge the openness of Japan? Not, as the Clinton administration is fond of doing, by pointing to international differences in the ratio of imports to GDP, Or to importers' shares of individual markets. Japan imports fewer cars than America or the European Union. But what of it? If Japan has a comparative advantage in car making, how low an import share is too low? Add distorting trade deals, such as restrictions on Japanese exports to Europe, and the question becomes knottier still.
Robert Lawrence, an economist at Harvard University, argues that prices area better guide: if entry into Japanese markets were free, international differences in prices would be narrowed by canny traders buying goods abroad and reselling them in Japan; if not, they would persist.
Such comparisons were undertaken by America's Department of Commerce and MITI as part of the Structural Impediments Initiative, the Bush administration's bid to prise Japan open. These indicated that in the early 1990s, for two-thirds of the goods surveyed, Japanese prices were higher. A study this year by the Institute for International Economics, a Washington, DC, think-tank, found a big gap between the wholesale prices of many Japanese goods and the price of imports at the dockside. And figures compiled by Japan's Economic Planning Agency indicate that the gap between the prices of food, clothing and consumer durables in Tokyo and prices in New York, far from shrinking, widened between 1990 and 1994. So, on Mr Lawrence's test, Japan has a case to answer.
Japan's efforts to deregulate its economy, however, may be changing this. In the car business, where retailers need specialist expertise, manufacturers still have tight control of sales networks. In the case of cheaper goods, where rules governing large shops have been relaxed, discounters have sprung up selling just about anything, foreign or Japanese, at lower prices. A can of beer can now be bought for Y139 ($1.65), compared with Y230 in an off-licence.
But deregulation is still slow. And that, paradoxically, is why this week's trade deal should be viewed warily. If Japan's car makers can be browbeaten into changing their suppliers, whether by America's government or by their own, that hardly represents a step towards a freer Japanese economy--or, indeed, towards freer trade.","IN THE end , a trade war was averted .

NO MATTER who wins, this month's election campaign in Japan will have produced something interesting. Political change is pushing Japan's politicians towards a new assertiveness. Casting about for a way to seize voters' imagination, campaigners from all main parties have denounced France's planned nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
On July 14th Toshiki Kaifu, leader of the opposition New Frontier Party, called for a consumer boycott of French imports. Three days later he was echoed by Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister and leader of one of the coalition's three parties. Yohei Kono, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, another of the coalition partners, lent his support to the idea of a parliamentary resolution criticising France. Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister and leader of the Social Democrats, announced that Japan will propose a UN resolution calling for an end to all nuclear testing.
Since 1993, when the Liberal Democrats lost their monopoly on power, pluralism has forced politicians to woo voters with exciting notions. Vested interests frustrate bold reform at home, so the easiest way to be exciting is in foreign policy. Until this week, the clearest sign of this had been in trade negotiations. Ryutaro Hashimoto, the trade minister, became a national hero last month by defying American demands that Japan rig its car market in favour of imports.
In the past, Mr Hashimoto's populism might have backfired, since the barons of his party would have resented it. These days, however, all parties want leaders who can win votes: nearly everyone describes Mr Hashimoto as a future prime minister. Another rising Liberal Democratic star is Makiko Tanaka, the science minister. Last month, when France announced it would conduct nuclear tests, she suggested that these should be carried out in Paris. This month's election campaign, together with anti-nuclear emotion aroused by the 50th anniversary next month of the bombing of Hiroshima, has heightened nationalism.
Which issue will be next to reflect this mood? Some Japanese are starting to mutter about their military alliance with America. The latest edition of Aera, a political weekly, carries a letter suggesting that the treaty be scrapped. This was prompted by an article published in the wake of the car talks with America, about the cost to Japan of keeping American troops on its territory. Its author, Shunji Taoka, claims that American troops do little to defend Japan, not least because they are concentrated in Okinawa, miles south of Japan's main islands.
In time, Japan's rising nationalism promises great change. For the moment, however, the French have little to worry about. A consumer boycott might, in theory, discomfort French fashion firms, which are masters at persuading Japanese consumers to surrender ridiculous sums of money. The share price of LVMH, which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, fell after a Japanese boycott was mooted. And on July 19th an association of 50,000 atom-bomb survivors announced that they would stop bung French goods. Yet the truth is that the vast majority of Japan's consumers have no tradition of boycotts, protests, or other politically correct deeds. It will be a while before Japanese ladies stamp on their Louis Vuitton handbags.","TOKYO

A generation of Japanese was growing up free of guilty memories; it was apparently more willing to acknowledge Japan's past aggression and brutality. An election in 1993 doubled the number of parliamentarians in the Diet's lower house born after the war. That August the new prime minister went further down the road to apology than his predecessors, calling Japan's invasion of Asia a ""war of aggression"". There was talk that in 1995 the Diet would pass a resolution of apology. The stage was set for a cathartic half-centenary.
Then the stage was bulldozed. Instead of providing an occasion for remorse, the Diet resolution galvanised an alliance opposed to the very idea of apology. More than 5m people, and a quarter of the members of the Diet, signed a petition aimed at blocking the resolution. An astonishing 70% of Diet members belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which dominates the coalition government, endorsed the campaign. In the end a much-watered-down resolution scraped through. It expressed a ""sense of deep remorse"" about the suffering of the war, but it also emphasised that Japan was not the sole aggressor. Individual politicians--even the prime minister--can apologise. The nation as a whole cannot.
The campaign's success depended in part on a collective rasp of history that is weak, to say the least. The leaders of the anti-apology campaign got away with denying that Japan colonised Korea (it did, between 1910 and 1945), or that it invaded other Asian states (it overran most of them). But there is more to this than simple amnesia--or, to put it another way, this amnesia is not so simple. The refusal to apologise shows up the threads that bind today's peaceful Japan to the pugnacious place of the 1930s.
Tied up
The first thread is anti-western feeling. The Japan that went to war felt encircled by a predatory West, a West which had hypocritically colonised Asia while frowning upon Japan's own colonialist desires. The Japan of today still feels put upon by the West, a West which urges nuclear nonproliferation while conducting nuclear tests, which preaches fair trade while threatening unilaterally to break the rules of the international trading system.
Japan's mistrust of the westerners' view of the war is most evident when it comes to the atomic bomb. According to a recent poll, only 3% of Japanese accept the common American claim that the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved lives on both sides by ending the war early. Fully 66% disagree, maintaining--as do some (but far from all) respectable western historians--that America used the bomb because of its racist contempt for Japanese, or because it wanted to intimidate the Soviet Union at the outset of the cold war.
This understandable suspicion of the West provided the ground on which the debate over the apology resolution was held--ground that was far from level. The no-apology side could get away with dismissing western critics of Japan's war-time conduct because ordinary Japanese see double-standards in so much of the West's rhetoric.
The second thread tying the present to the past is closely interwoven with the first. Japan's political suspicion of Americans and Europeans is matched by a cultural fear. Now, just as in the 1930s, the Japanese are torn between emulation of the West and a horror of becoming too western. The more some people import fashions and ideas, the more others grow obsessed with the supposedly unique features of their own culture. Both before and since the war, the Japanese have been fascinated by nihonjinron, a field of study that attempts to define the essence of Japaneseness.
Again, this cultural defensiveness was evident in the no-apology campaign. In the campaigners' view, Japan's self-respect was undermined by America's post-war occupation, which imposed an American constitution and American ideas, and during which improbably tall GIS took advantage of Japanese women. Since the Americans also forced Japan to say sorry for the war, cultural westernisation and contrition have come to be linked. In the minds of many Japanese, apology is tantamount to a betrayal of Japan's identity.
These continuing political and cultural insecurities are not too alarming. The country has changed so much in the past 50 years that a repeat of the 1930s is unimaginable. The Japanese are immeasurably more educated and free than the generation that went to war; they are richer; and they are governed by a constitution that the Americans designed precisely to bury militarism. All this has happened, despite the constant threads of nationalist sentiment, because other circumstances have changed beyond recognition. So why, apart from the inexorable cycling of the calendar, do those constant threads deserve attention now?
The answer is that the circumstances will continue to change. 'The next half century will be different from the past one. Economic success has made Japan the world's biggest supplier of cross-border investment and foreign aid. Japanese officials head the UN'S efforts to help refugees, protect the world's health and deal with the Bosnian war--and, unsurprisingly, Japan wants a permanent seat on the security council. Japan's military stance is evolving from a sub missive acceptance of American protection. The country is paying more and more towards the cost of keeping American troops on its soil, and sooner or later it may want to divert some of this money to its own armed men. Doubts about America's commitment to underwrite Asia's security will hasten that day.
The bigger Japan's influence in the world, the more disquieting a xenophobic undercurrent in Japan. That is especially so when the undercurrent can exert real institutional force--and the no-apology protests have shown that this undercurrent can. The no-apology activists emphasise devotion to the emperor, and have strong links with Shinto shrines--just like their pre-war predecessors. The conquering Americans thought they had tamed these rallying points of nationalism during the occupation. But their influence survived; it is now growing.
Veterans and Shinto
On the roof of Tokyo's Kudan Kaikan building young people drink beer served by girls in bunny outfits. Down in the basement, Sakae Suehiro fulminates against such decadence. Mr Suehiro is a big wheel in the Association of Bereaved Families, which was founded to honour Japan's war dead and to see to the repatriation of their remains. Gradually, however, the association has assumed new roles. Honouring the war dead has come to mean defending the cause for which they fell, and lambasting modern indifference to Japan's traditional virtues.
Mr Suehiro and his colleagues set much store by the Imperial Rescript on Education, promulgated in 1890. It laid down that qualities deemed especially Japanese should be instilled into the nation's youth, that it might serve the emperor gloriously. Accordingly, the first lesson of each day was to be devoted to moral training. There was much emphasis on loyalty and filial piety. Pupils recited oaths to sacrifice their lives gladly for the emperor.
The rescript was denounced during the American occupation--a denunciation Mr Suehiro denounces in his turn. The postwar Tokyo Trials, in which foreign judges condemned Japanese leaders, taught the Japanese that they were wrong: wrong in starting the war, and wrong in their pre-war values. The truth, Mr Suehiro maintains, is that Japan did not so much colonise Asian states as liberate them from white dominance, thus bringing the rage of the West down upon a Japan that it had sought to stymie. It is time, he concludes, for Japanese to feel proud of themselves. That is why his association campaigned against the apology resolution.
Mr Suehiro should not be taken lightly. His association claims a membership of 1m households; 150,000 of these loyalists are also LDP members. It is rich enough to employ 380 full-time staff, and to make itself helpful to friendly politicians. In last month's election for the upper house of the Diet, the association claims to have mustered 2m votes on behalf of its favourite candidate The association's chairman is Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is currently Japan's trade minister. Next month Mr Hashimoto hopes to be elected president of the LDP; he could become prime minister.
On top of these political links, the association has quietly joined hands with the top brass of Shintoism. The no-apology campaign was partly organised by Yoshinari Mori, the deputy chief priest of Meiji shrine, which stands at the centre of a majestic wood in central Tokyo. Mr Mori is a handsome, confident man in his 50s; he produces his business card from the sleeve of his kimono. Like the older Mr Suehiro, he has much to say about national pride. But his favourite subject is the emperor.
Japan, he says, is not merely a country. It is a race, almost a family. At the head of this clan there is the emperor, who is descended directly from Amaterasu, the sun goddess. The unbroken imperial line is a symbol of Japan's ethnic coherence; naturally it should be worshipped. And, since the war was fought in the emperor's name, to apologise for it would be unthinkable.
Mr Mori regrets that, after the war, the Americans forced the emperor to renounce his divinity. He says it would be better if the emperor still had the power to issue edicts and commands, since their wisdom would strengthen the emperor's popular following. The constitution drafted by the Americans should be revised to recognise the emperor as Japan's sovereign, not merely its symbol. Mr Mori also deplores the constitution's pacifist clause, saying that Japan will only recover its self-respect when it can defend itself.
Yasukuni poetry
America tried to sever the links between Shintoism and politics--links which were, after all, fairly new. It was only a hundred years ago that, at the time of the Imperial Rescript on Education, Japan's nationalists bean turning Shintoism from a harmless nature-worshipping faith into an ideology of Japaneseness. The Americans thought they could undo this change by way of institutions. Their constitution stipulated a strict division between religion and the state. The government ministry that administered Shintoism was closed; a Shinto university that had turned out cohorts of ideologues was shut down also. But the links remain, and the institutions have returned.
Tokyo's great Shinto shrines could scarcely exist without promoting nationalism. Meiji is a fine example. It has no place in the nature-worshipping past; it was built to enshrine the soul of the Meiji emperor, whose reign from 1867 to 1912 marked the emergence of Shinto-centred nationalism. A pamphlet explains that, after the death of the Meiji emperor and his wife, the shrine was put up in response to ""the entire nation's passionate desire to worship the holy spirit of the imperial couple, and to adore and respect their saintly virtue eternally.""
Behind its spectacular gateway, Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine is even more nationalistic. It was built in the Meiji period to enshrine the souls of Japan's war dead, and until 1945 its priests were appointed by the war ministry, and enjoyed the rank of colonel. Among the cherry trees in the rounds there is an exhibit of uniforms and military paraphernalia, particularly suicide weapons: a torpedo guided by a human crew; a mine attached to a bamboo that was hand-delivered by a diver; various types of suicide aircraft. The 6,000 who died in such contraptions were ""incomparable in their tragic bravery,"" explains an inscription in the shrine museum, and ""engulfed the entire country in tears of gratitude.""
The nationalism of these shrines has grown more obvious as the American occupation has receded. The Americans briefly closed Yasukuni after the war, and insisted that its overt militarism be tempered. After they had left, bronze engravings celebrating Japanese military victories were restored, and the spirits of Japan's executed war criminals were enshrined. The inscription honouring the cult of suicide was put up in 1985, to mark the war's 40th anniversary. And this year Yasukuni brought out a book of poems written by soldiers at the front. One, dated 1944, is chalked up on a blackboard in the shrine's rounds. ""I devote myself to the country. This is my highest pleasure ... We will colour history with our blood.""
The unravelling of America's post-war design is also evident at Ise, a small town near Osaka remarkable only for its shrine and for a theme park that allows locals to visit Spain without the inconvenience of air travel. Like the Meiji shrine, Ise is devoted to the imperial cult, and particularly to the sun goddess Amaterasu. Only the emperor is allowed to pass through the four gates leading to the inner shrine, but this does not seem to hurt Ise's growing popularity among ordinary pilgrims. Last year 8.3m came to wash their hands in the purifying river that runs through the shrine's park, and to buy amulets from its kiosks.
Outside the park is Kogakkan, the Shinto university that the Americans closed down. Like Yasukuni, it was soon reopened. It now has 20,000 students. Its senior professor, Katsunoshin Sakurai, recites the familiar nationalist line: Japan's culture and pride must be restored, Japan needs a bier army. The university's pamphlet explains that students are taught to ""uphold high ideals of the true Japanese"". Two students assailing each other with kendo swords illustrate the point.
The government's Shinto affairs department, which the Americans also closed down, has been resurrected as the Association of Shinto Shrines. During the debate over the war apology, its officials spoke to the top Liberal Democrats in the Diet at least once a day. Indeed, politicians always make a point of listening to the association's views, not least because its staff oblige by organising campaign meeting in local shrines before elections. Roughly one in four Diet members owes his job partly to the shrines' support.
Nationalism, old and new
The power of nationalistic pressure groups, whose leaders are intimate with senior politicians, is rarely as evident as it was when the apology resolution was blocked. Most of the changes they help bring about are symbolic and little noticed beyond Japan's shores. National Foundation Day, the commemoration of Japan's birth from a union of two gods, was struck from the list of public holidays by the Americans; it is now reinstated. The use of the imperial calendar, which counts years from the date of the reigning emperor's coronation (this year, for example, is known as Heisei seven) is now compulsory in public life. The state paid for the current emperor to be enthroned with full Shinto rites.
The question is how long this modesty will endure. Most nationalists want to step up the fight over the past; the shrines' association this year won approval for a history book from the education ministry's censors. Some nationalists talk of rolling back the separation of religion and state in much bolder ways: by having Shintoism taught in schools, or by forging an anti-crime alliance between the local shrines and police. And just about all nationalists would like a stronger army, despite the pacifist constitution.
Up to a point, these desires are natural. After the war, Japan had no choice about accepting its new constitution. It is hardly surprising that, 50 years on, some Japanese should want to revise it. But Japan's nationalists are disquieting all the same, because they mix reasonable desires with unreasonable emotions-nostalgia for the martial values of old Japan, instinctive suspicion of foreigners. A Shinto revival would not be like a religious revival elsewhere: Shintoism is exclusively Japanese, its mythology fosters racial consciousness. Of the world's big religions, only Judaism comes close to this.
With luck, Japan will find a way of containing the worrying emotions while accommodating the more reasonable desires. The attitudes of Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987, make clear how such a compromise might be achieved. Mr Nakasone made a point of worshipping at Yasukuni shrine on the 40th anniversary of the war's end; he opposed the Diet apology, growls that Japan is often slighted by foreign powers, and wants a stronger army. Yet he is also prepared to apologise for some parts of Japan's war. And he preaches that Japan should open its mind and its markets to foreign ideas and products.
In a recent speech reflecting on the anniversary of the war, Mr Nakasone did make one triumphalist suggestion. Japan, he said, had created a brand new model of economic development, ""a profoundly important gift"" to the world, which had in turn brought about the wider Asian miracle. This aligns him with a new nationalism, one that has little to do with Shinto emperor-worship and the like. The new nationalism emphasises Japan's achievements since the war, and is generally unburdened by feeling of inferiority towards outsiders. It is the creed of the bright and the young, who have travelled the world and studied abroad, and who argue Japan's case more forcefully than their elders ever could in international meetings.
In the next half century, America's security umbrella may be folded up; China will grow powerful and may grow threatening. These changes are bound to make Japan more assertive. Whether this is good or bad will depend on the balance between two types of nationalism: the old, backward-looking sort and its newer alternative. Mr Nakasone's views hold out the hope that the old may blur into the new, and gradually be displaced by it. This would produce a forceful Japan, sometimes no doubt an awkward one. But at least it would be a Japan shorn of its old xenophobia and chauvinism.","UNTIL this year , it seemed reasonable to hope that the 50th anniversary of defeat in the Pacific war would prod Japan to newly frank apologies . A generation of Japanese was growing up free of guilty memories ; it was apparently more willing to acknowledge Japan 's past aggression and brutality . An election in 1993 doubled the number of parliamentarians in the Diet 's lower house born after the war . That August the new prime minister went further down the road to apology than his predecessors , calling Japan 's invasion of Asia a "" war of aggression "" . There was talk that in 1995 the Diet would pass a resolution of apology . The stage was set for a cathartic half - centenary . 
 Then the stage was bulldozed . Instead of providing an occasion for remorse , the Diet resolution galvanised an alliance opposed to the very idea of apology . More than 5 m people , and a quarter of the members of the Diet , signed a petition aimed at blocking the resolution . An astonishing 70 % of Diet members belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which dominates the coalition government , endorsed the campaign . In the end a much - watered - down resolution scraped through . It expressed a "" sense of deep remorse "" about the suffering of the war , but it also emphasised that Japan was not the sole aggressor . Individual politicians -- even the prime minister -- can apologise . The nation as a whole can not . 
 The campaign 's success depended in part on a collective rasp of history that is weak , to say the least . The leaders of the anti - apology campaign got away with denying that Japan colonised Korea ( it did , between 1910 and 1945 ) , or that it invaded other Asian states ( it overran most of them ) . But there is more to this than simple amnesia -- or , to put it another way , this amnesia is not so simple . The refusal to apologise shows up the threads that bind today 's peaceful Japan to the pugnacious place of the 1930s . 
 Tied up 
 The first thread is anti - western feeling . The Japan that went to war felt encircled by a predatory West , a West which had hypocritically colonised Asia while frowning upon Japan 's own colonialist desires . The Japan of today still feels put upon by the West , a West which urges nuclear nonproliferation while conducting nuclear tests , which preaches fair trade while threatening unilaterally to break the rules of the international trading system . 
 Japan 's mistrust of the westerners ' view of the war is most evident when it comes to the atomic bomb . According to a recent poll , only 3 % of Japanese accept the common American claim that the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved lives on both sides by ending the war early . Fully 66 % disagree , maintaining -- as do some ( but far from all ) respectable western historians -- that America used the bomb because of its racist contempt for Japanese , or because it wanted to intimidate the Soviet Union at the outset of the cold war . 
 This understandable suspicion of the West provided the ground on which the debate over the apology resolution was held -- ground that was far from level . The no - apology side could get away with dismissing western critics of Japan 's war - time conduct because ordinary Japanese see double - standards in so much of the West 's rhetoric . 
 The second thread tying the present to the past is closely interwoven with the first . Japan 's political suspicion of Americans and Europeans is matched by a cultural fear . Now , just as in the 1930s , the Japanese are torn between emulation of the West and a horror of becoming too western . The more some people import fashions and ideas , the more others grow obsessed with the supposedly unique features of their own culture . Both before and since the war , the Japanese have been fascinated by nihonjinron , a field of study that attempts to define the essence of Japaneseness . 
 Again , this cultural defensiveness was evident in the no - apology campaign . In the campaigners ' view , Japan 's self - respect was undermined by America 's post - war occupation , which imposed an American constitution and American ideas , and during which improbably tall GIS took advantage of Japanese women . Since the Americans also forced Japan to say sorry for the war , cultural westernisation and contrition have come to be linked . In the minds of many Japanese , apology is tantamount to a betrayal of Japan 's identity . 
 These continuing political and cultural insecurities are not too alarming . The country has changed so much in the past 50 years that a repeat of the 1930s is unimaginable . The Japanese are immeasurably more educated and free than the generation that went to war ; they are richer ; and they are governed by a constitution that the Americans designed precisely to bury militarism . All this has happened , despite the constant threads of nationalist sentiment , because other circumstances have changed beyond recognition . So why , apart from the inexorable cycling of the calendar , do those constant threads deserve attention now ? 
 The answer is that the circumstances will continue to change . ' The next half century will be different from the past one . Economic success has made Japan the world 's biggest supplier of cross - border investment and foreign aid . Japanese officials head the UN 'S efforts to help refugees , protect the world 's health and deal with the Bosnian war -- and , unsurprisingly , Japan wants a permanent seat on the security council . Japan 's military stance is evolving from a sub missive acceptance of American protection . The country is paying more and more towards the cost of keeping American troops on its soil , and sooner or later it may want to divert some of this money to its own armed men . Doubts about America 's commitment to underwrite Asia 's security will hasten that day . 
 The bigger Japan 's influence in the world , the more disquieting a xenophobic undercurrent in Japan . That is especially so when the undercurrent can exert real institutional force -- and the no - apology protests have shown that this undercurrent can . The no - apology activists emphasise devotion to the emperor , and have strong links with Shinto shrines -- just like their pre - war predecessors . The conquering Americans thought they had tamed these rallying points of nationalism during the occupation . But their influence survived ; it is now growing . 
 Veterans and Shinto 
 On the roof of Tokyo 's Kudan Kaikan building young people drink beer served by girls in bunny outfits . Down in the basement , Sakae Suehiro fulminates against such decadence . Mr Suehiro is a big wheel in the Association of Bereaved Families , which was founded to honour Japan 's war dead and to see to the repatriation of their remains . Gradually , however , the association has assumed new roles . Honouring the war dead has come to mean defending the cause for which they fell , and lambasting modern indifference to Japan 's traditional virtues . 
 Mr Suehiro and his colleagues set much store by the Imperial Rescript on Education , promulgated in 1890 . It laid down that qualities deemed especially Japanese should be instilled into the nation 's youth , that it might serve the emperor gloriously . Accordingly , the first lesson of each day was to be devoted to moral training . There was much emphasis on loyalty and filial piety . Pupils recited oaths to sacrifice their lives gladly for the emperor . 
 The rescript was denounced during the American occupation -- a denunciation Mr Suehiro denounces in his turn . The postwar Tokyo Trials , in which foreign judges condemned Japanese leaders , taught the Japanese that they were wrong : wrong in starting the war , and wrong in their pre - war values . The truth , Mr Suehiro maintains , is that Japan did not so much colonise Asian states as liberate them from white dominance , thus bringing the rage of the West down upon a Japan that it had sought to stymie . It is time , he concludes , for Japanese to feel proud of themselves . That is why his association campaigned against the apology resolution . 
 Mr Suehiro should not be taken lightly . His association claims a membership of 1 m households ; 150,000 of these loyalists are also LDP members . It is rich enough to employ 380 full - time staff , and to make itself helpful to friendly politicians . In last month 's election for the upper house of the Diet , the association claims to have mustered 2 m votes on behalf of its favourite candidate The association 's chairman is Ryutaro Hashimoto's . Next month Ryutaro Hashimoto hopes to be elected president of the LDP ; Ryutaro Hashimoto could become prime minister . 
 On top of these political links , the association has quietly joined hands with the top brass of Shintoism . The no - apology campaign was partly organised by Yoshinari Mori , the deputy chief priest of Meiji shrine , which stands at the centre of a majestic wood in central Tokyo . Mr Mori is a handsome , confident man in his 50s ; he produces his business card from the sleeve of his kimono . Like the older Mr Suehiro , he has much to say about national pride . But his favourite subject is the emperor . 
 Japan , he says , is not merely a country . It is a race , almost a family . At the head of this clan there is the emperor , who is descended directly from Amaterasu , the sun goddess . The unbroken imperial line is a symbol of Japan 's ethnic coherence ; naturally it should be worshipped . And , since the war was fought in the emperor 's name , to apologise for it would be unthinkable . 
 Mr Mori regrets that , after the war , the Americans forced the emperor to renounce his divinity . He says it would be better if the emperor still had the power to issue edicts and commands , since their wisdom would strengthen the emperor 's popular following . The constitution drafted by the Americans should be revised to recognise the emperor as Japan 's sovereign , not merely its symbol . Mr Mori also deplores the constitution 's pacifist clause , saying that Japan will only recover its self - respect when it can defend itself . 
 Yasukuni poetry 
 America tried to sever the links between Shintoism and politics -- links which were , after all , fairly new . It was only a hundred years ago that , at the time of the Imperial Rescript on Education , Japan 's nationalists bean turning Shintoism from a harmless nature - worshipping faith into an ideology of Japaneseness . The Americans thought they could undo this change by way of institutions . Their constitution stipulated a strict division between religion and the state . The government ministry that administered Shintoism was closed ; a Shinto university that had turned out cohorts of ideologues was shut down also . But the links remain , and the institutions have returned . 
 Tokyo 's great Shinto shrines could scarcely exist without promoting nationalism . Meiji is a fine example . It has no place in the nature - worshipping past ; it was built to enshrine the soul of the Meiji emperor , whose reign from 1867 to 1912 marked the emergence of Shinto - centred nationalism . A pamphlet explains that , after the death of the Meiji emperor and his wife , the shrine was put up in response to "" the entire nation 's passionate desire to worship the holy spirit of the imperial couple , and to adore and respect their saintly virtue eternally . "" 
 Behind its spectacular gateway , Tokyo 's Yasukuni shrine is even more nationalistic . It was built in the Meiji period to enshrine the souls of Japan 's war dead , and until 1945 its priests were appointed by the war ministry , and enjoyed the rank of colonel . Among the cherry trees in the rounds there is an exhibit of uniforms and military paraphernalia , particularly suicide weapons : a torpedo guided by a human crew ; a mine attached to a bamboo that was hand - delivered by a diver ; various types of suicide aircraft . The 6,000 who died in such contraptions were "" incomparable in their tragic bravery , "" explains an inscription in the shrine museum , and "" engulfed the entire country in tears of gratitude . "" 
 The nationalism of these shrines has grown more obvious as the American occupation has receded . The Americans briefly closed Yasukuni after the war , and insisted that its overt militarism be tempered . After they had left , bronze engravings celebrating Japanese military victories were restored , and the spirits of Japan 's executed war criminals were enshrined . The inscription honouring the cult of suicide was put up in 1985 , to mark the war 's 40th anniversary . And this year Yasukuni brought out a book of poems written by soldiers at the front . One , dated 1944 , is chalked up on a blackboard in the shrine 's rounds . "" I devote myself to the country . This is my highest pleasure ... We will colour history with our blood . "" 
 The unravelling of America 's post - war design is also evident at Ise , a small town near Osaka remarkable only for its shrine and for a theme park that allows locals to visit Spain without the inconvenience of air travel . Like the Meiji shrine , Ise is devoted to the imperial cult , and particularly to the sun goddess Amaterasu . Only the emperor is allowed to pass through the four gates leading to the inner shrine , but this does not seem to hurt Ise 's growing popularity among ordinary pilgrims . Last year 8.3 m came to wash their hands in the purifying river that runs through the shrine 's park , and to buy amulets from its kiosks . 
 Outside the park is Kogakkan , the Shinto university that the Americans closed down . Like Yasukuni , it was soon reopened . It now has 20,000 students . Its senior professor , Katsunoshin Sakurai , recites the familiar nationalist line : Japan 's culture and pride must be restored , Japan needs a bier army . The university 's pamphlet explains that students are taught to "" uphold high ideals of the true Japanese "" . Two students assailing each other with kendo swords illustrate the point . 
 The government 's Shinto affairs department , which the Americans also closed down , has been resurrected as the Association of Shinto Shrines . During the debate over the war apology , its officials spoke to the top Liberal Democrats in the Diet at least once a day . Indeed , politicians always make a point of listening to the association 's views , not least because its staff oblige by organising campaign meeting in local shrines before elections .

During the debate over the war apology, its officials spoke to the top Liberal Democrats in the Diet at least once a day. Indeed, politicians always make a point of listening to the association's views, not least because its staff oblige by organising campaign meeting in local shrines before elections. Roughly one in four Diet members owes his job partly to the shrines' support.
Nationalism, old and new
The power of nationalistic pressure groups, whose leaders are intimate with senior politicians, is rarely as evident as it was when the apology resolution was blocked. Most of the changes they help bring about are symbolic and little noticed beyond Japan's shores. National Foundation Day, the commemoration of Japan's birth from a union of two gods, was struck from the list of public holidays by the Americans; it is now reinstated. The use of the imperial calendar, which counts years from the date of the reigning emperor's coronation (this year, for example, is known as Heisei seven) is now compulsory in public life. The state paid for the current emperor to be enthroned with full Shinto rites.
The question is how long this modesty will endure. Most nationalists want to step up the fight over the past; the shrines' association this year won approval for a history book from the education ministry's censors. Some nationalists talk of rolling back the separation of religion and state in much bolder ways: by having Shintoism taught in schools, or by forging an anti-crime alliance between the local shrines and police. And just about all nationalists would like a stronger army, despite the pacifist constitution.
Up to a point, these desires are natural. After the war, Japan had no choice about accepting its new constitution. It is hardly surprising that, 50 years on, some Japanese should want to revise it. But Japan's nationalists are disquieting all the same, because they mix reasonable desires with unreasonable emotions-nostalgia for the martial values of old Japan, instinctive suspicion of foreigners. A Shinto revival would not be like a religious revival elsewhere: Shintoism is exclusively Japanese, its mythology fosters racial consciousness. Of the world's big religions, only Judaism comes close to this.
With luck, Japan will find a way of containing the worrying emotions while accommodating the more reasonable desires. The attitudes of Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987, make clear how such a compromise might be achieved. Mr Nakasone made a point of worshipping at Yasukuni shrine on the 40th anniversary of the war's end; he opposed the Diet apology, growls that Japan is often slighted by foreign powers, and wants a stronger army. Yet he is also prepared to apologise for some parts of Japan's war. And he preaches that Japan should open its mind and its markets to foreign ideas and products.
In a recent speech reflecting on the anniversary of the war, Mr Nakasone did make one triumphalist suggestion. Japan, he said, had created a brand new model of economic development, ""a profoundly important gift"" to the world, which had in turn brought about the wider Asian miracle. This aligns him with a new nationalism, one that has little to do with Shinto emperor-worship and the like. The new nationalism emphasises Japan's achievements since the war, and is generally unburdened by feeling of inferiority towards outsiders. It is the creed of the bright and the young, who have travelled the world and studied abroad, and who argue Japan's case more forcefully than their elders ever could in international meetings.
In the next half century, America's security umbrella may be folded up; China will grow powerful and may grow threatening. These changes are bound to make Japan more assertive. Whether this is good or bad will depend on the balance between two types of nationalism: the old, backward-looking sort and its newer alternative. Mr Nakasone's views hold out the hope that the old may blur into the new, and gradually be displaced by it. This would produce a forceful Japan, sometimes no doubt an awkward one. But at least it would be a Japan shorn of its old xenophobia and chauvinism.","UNTIL this year , it seemed reasonable to hope that the 50th anniversary of defeat in the Pacific war would prod Japan to newly frank apologies . A generation of Japanese was growing up free of guilty memories ; it was apparently more willing to acknowledge Japan 's past aggression and brutality . An election in 1993 doubled the number of parliamentarians in the Diet 's lower house born after the war . That August the new prime minister went further down the road to apology than his predecessors , calling Japan 's invasion of Asia a "" war of aggression "" . There was talk that in 1995 the Diet would pass a resolution of apology . The stage was set for a cathartic half - centenary . 
 Then the stage was bulldozed . Instead of providing an occasion for remorse , the Diet resolution galvanised an alliance opposed to the very idea of apology . More than 5 m people , and a quarter of the members of the Diet , signed a petition aimed at blocking the resolution . An astonishing 70 % of Diet members belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which dominates the coalition government , endorsed the campaign . In the end a much - watered - down resolution scraped through . It expressed a "" sense of deep remorse "" about the suffering of the war , but it also emphasised that Japan was not the sole aggressor . Individual politicians -- even the prime minister -- can apologise . The nation as a whole can not . 
 The campaign 's success depended in part on a collective rasp of history that is weak , to say the least . The leaders of the anti - apology campaign got away with denying that Japan colonised Korea ( it did , between 1910 and 1945 ) , or that it invaded other Asian states ( it overran most of them ) . But there is more to this than simple amnesia -- or , to put it another way , this amnesia is not so simple . The refusal to apologise shows up the threads that bind today 's peaceful Japan to the pugnacious place of the 1930s . 
 Tied up 
 The first thread is anti - western feeling . The Japan that went to war felt encircled by a predatory West , a West which had hypocritically colonised Asia while frowning upon Japan 's own colonialist desires . The Japan of today still feels put upon by the West , a West which urges nuclear nonproliferation while conducting nuclear tests , which preaches fair trade while threatening unilaterally to break the rules of the international trading system . 
 Japan 's mistrust of the westerners ' view of the war is most evident when it comes to the atomic bomb . According to a recent poll , only 3 % of Japanese accept the common American claim that the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved lives on both sides by ending the war early . Fully 66 % disagree , maintaining -- as do some ( but far from all ) respectable western historians -- that America used the bomb because of its racist contempt for Japanese , or because it wanted to intimidate the Soviet Union at the outset of the cold war . 
 This understandable suspicion of the West provided the ground on which the debate over the apology resolution was held -- ground that was far from level . The no - apology side could get away with dismissing western critics of Japan 's war - time conduct because ordinary Japanese see double - standards in so much of the West 's rhetoric . 
 The second thread tying the present to the past is closely interwoven with the first . Japan 's political suspicion of Americans and Europeans is matched by a cultural fear . Now , just as in the 1930s , the Japanese are torn between emulation of the West and a horror of becoming too western . The more some people import fashions and ideas , the more others grow obsessed with the supposedly unique features of their own culture . Both before and since the war , the Japanese have been fascinated by nihonjinron , a field of study that attempts to define the essence of Japaneseness . 
 Again , this cultural defensiveness was evident in the no - apology campaign . In the campaigners ' view , Japan 's self - respect was undermined by America 's post - war occupation , which imposed an American constitution and American ideas , and during which improbably tall GIS took advantage of Japanese women . Since the Americans also forced Japan to say sorry for the war , cultural westernisation and contrition have come to be linked . In the minds of many Japanese , apology is tantamount to a betrayal of Japan 's identity . 
 These continuing political and cultural insecurities are not too alarming . The country has changed so much in the past 50 years that a repeat of the 1930s is unimaginable . The Japanese are immeasurably more educated and free than the generation that went to war ; they are richer ; and they are governed by a constitution that the Americans designed precisely to bury militarism . All this has happened , despite the constant threads of nationalist sentiment , because other circumstances have changed beyond recognition . So why , apart from the inexorable cycling of the calendar , do those constant threads deserve attention now ? 
 The answer is that the circumstances will continue to change . ' The next half century will be different from the past one . Economic success has made Japan the world 's biggest supplier of cross - border investment and foreign aid . Japanese officials head the UN 'S efforts to help refugees , protect the world 's health and deal with the Bosnian war -- and , unsurprisingly , Japan wants a permanent seat on the security council . Japan 's military stance is evolving from a sub missive acceptance of American protection . The country is paying more and more towards the cost of keeping American troops on its soil , and sooner or later it may want to divert some of this money to its own armed men . Doubts about America 's commitment to underwrite Asia 's security will hasten that day . 
 The bigger Japan 's influence in the world , the more disquieting a xenophobic undercurrent in Japan . That is especially so when the undercurrent can exert real institutional force -- and the no - apology protests have shown that this undercurrent can . The no - apology activists emphasise devotion to the emperor , and have strong links with Shinto shrines -- just like their pre - war predecessors . The conquering Americans thought they had tamed these rallying points of nationalism during the occupation . But their influence survived ; it is now growing . 
 Veterans and Shinto 
 On the roof of Tokyo 's Kudan Kaikan building young people drink beer served by girls in bunny outfits . Down in the basement , Sakae Suehiro fulminates against such decadence . Mr Suehiro is a big wheel in the Association of Bereaved Families , which was founded to honour Japan 's war dead and to see to the repatriation of their remains . Gradually , however , the association has assumed new roles . Honouring the war dead has come to mean defending the cause for which they fell , and lambasting modern indifference to Japan 's traditional virtues . 
 Mr Suehiro and his colleagues set much store by the Imperial Rescript on Education , promulgated in 1890 . It laid down that qualities deemed especially Japanese should be instilled into the nation 's youth , that it might serve the emperor gloriously . Accordingly , the first lesson of each day was to be devoted to moral training . There was much emphasis on loyalty and filial piety . Pupils recited oaths to sacrifice their lives gladly for the emperor . 
 The rescript was denounced during the American occupation -- a denunciation Mr Suehiro denounces in his turn . The postwar Tokyo Trials , in which foreign judges condemned Japanese leaders , taught the Japanese that they were wrong : wrong in starting the war , and wrong in their pre - war values . The truth , Mr Suehiro maintains , is that Japan did not so much colonise Asian states as liberate them from white dominance , thus bringing the rage of the West down upon a Japan that it had sought to stymie . It is time , he concludes , for Japanese to feel proud of themselves . That is why his association campaigned against the apology resolution . 
 Mr Suehiro should not be taken lightly . His association claims a membership of 1 m households ; 150,000 of these loyalists are also LDP members . It is rich enough to employ 380 full - time staff , and to make itself helpful to friendly politicians . In last month 's election for the upper house of the Diet , the association claims to have mustered 2 m votes on behalf of its favourite candidate The association 's chairman is Ryutaro Hashimoto's . Next month Ryutaro Hashimoto hopes to be elected president of the LDP ; Ryutaro Hashimoto could become prime minister . 
 On top of these political links , the association has quietly joined hands with the top brass of Shintoism . The no - apology campaign was partly organised by Yoshinari Mori , the deputy chief priest of Meiji shrine , which stands at the centre of a majestic wood in central Tokyo . Mr Mori is a handsome , confident man in his 50s ; he produces his business card from the sleeve of his kimono . Like the older Mr Suehiro , he has much to say about national pride . But his favourite subject is the emperor . 
 Japan , he says , is not merely a country . It is a race , almost a family . At the head of this clan there is the emperor , who is descended directly from Amaterasu , the sun goddess . The unbroken imperial line is a symbol of Japan 's ethnic coherence ; naturally it should be worshipped . And , since the war was fought in the emperor 's name , to apologise for it would be unthinkable . 
 Mr Mori regrets that , after the war , the Americans forced the emperor to renounce his divinity . He says it would be better if the emperor still had the power to issue edicts and commands , since their wisdom would strengthen the emperor 's popular following . The constitution drafted by the Americans should be revised to recognise the emperor as Japan 's sovereign , not merely its symbol . Mr Mori also deplores the constitution 's pacifist clause , saying that Japan will only recover its self - respect when it can defend itself . 
 Yasukuni poetry 
 America tried to sever the links between Shintoism and politics -- links which were , after all , fairly new . It was only a hundred years ago that , at the time of the Imperial Rescript on Education , Japan 's nationalists bean turning Shintoism from a harmless nature - worshipping faith into an ideology of Japaneseness . The Americans thought they could undo this change by way of institutions . Their constitution stipulated a strict division between religion and the state . The government ministry that administered Shintoism was closed ; a Shinto university that had turned out cohorts of ideologues was shut down also . But the links remain , and the institutions have returned . 
 Tokyo 's great Shinto shrines could scarcely exist without promoting nationalism . Meiji is a fine example . It has no place in the nature - worshipping past ; it was built to enshrine the soul of the Meiji emperor , whose reign from 1867 to 1912 marked the emergence of Shinto - centred nationalism . A pamphlet explains that , after the death of the Meiji emperor and his wife , the shrine was put up in response to "" the entire nation 's passionate desire to worship the holy spirit of the imperial couple , and to adore and respect their saintly virtue eternally . "" 
 Behind its spectacular gateway , Tokyo 's Yasukuni shrine is even more nationalistic . It was built in the Meiji period to enshrine the souls of Japan 's war dead , and until 1945 its priests were appointed by the war ministry , and enjoyed the rank of colonel . Among the cherry trees in the rounds there is an exhibit of uniforms and military paraphernalia , particularly suicide weapons : a torpedo guided by a human crew ; a mine attached to a bamboo that was hand - delivered by a diver ; various types of suicide aircraft . The 6,000 who died in such contraptions were "" incomparable in their tragic bravery , "" explains an inscription in the shrine museum , and "" engulfed the entire country in tears of gratitude . "" 
 The nationalism of these shrines has grown more obvious as the American occupation has receded . The Americans briefly closed Yasukuni after the war , and insisted that its overt militarism be tempered . After they had left , bronze engravings celebrating Japanese military victories were restored , and the spirits of Japan 's executed war criminals were enshrined . The inscription honouring the cult of suicide was put up in 1985 , to mark the war 's 40th anniversary . And this year Yasukuni brought out a book of poems written by soldiers at the front . One , dated 1944 , is chalked up on a blackboard in the shrine 's rounds . "" I devote myself to the country . This is my highest pleasure ... We will colour history with our blood . "" 
 The unravelling of America 's post - war design is also evident at Ise , a small town near Osaka remarkable only for its shrine and for a theme park that allows locals to visit Spain without the inconvenience of air travel . Like the Meiji shrine , Ise is devoted to the imperial cult , and particularly to the sun goddess Amaterasu . Only the emperor is allowed to pass through the four gates leading to the inner shrine , but this does not seem to hurt Ise 's growing popularity among ordinary pilgrims . Last year 8.3 m came to wash their hands in the purifying river that runs through the shrine 's park , and to buy amulets from its kiosks . 
 Outside the park is Kogakkan , the Shinto university that the Americans closed down . Like Yasukuni , it was soon reopened . It now has 20,000 students . Its senior professor , Katsunoshin Sakurai , recites the familiar nationalist line : Japan 's culture and pride must be restored , Japan needs a bier army . The university 's pamphlet explains that students are taught to "" uphold high ideals of the true Japanese "" . Two students assailing each other with kendo swords illustrate the point . 
 The government 's Shinto affairs department , which the Americans also closed down , has been resurrected as the Association of Shinto Shrines . During the debate over the war apology , its officials spoke to the top Liberal Democrats in the Diet at least once a day . Indeed , politicians always make a point of listening to the association 's views , not least because its staff oblige by organising campaign meeting in local shrines before elections .

Beijing's foreigners
Tens of thousands of women arrived in Beijing for the fourth United Nations World Conference on Women.

Local officials warned delegates that demonstrations would be tolerated only at the conference site, and not even there if they were directed at China.
Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister, will not seek re-election as president of the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest group in the ruling coalition. He is likely to be succeeded by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the trade minister.
A car bomb killed Beant Singh, the chief minister of Punjab, in Chandigarh, the capital of the states of Punjab and Haryana. Mr Singh, a member of the ruling Congress Party, was a close ally of Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister. He had been chief minister since 1992.","Force majeure
NATO launched a series of massive air raids on Serbian positions around Sarajevo and in Serb-held Bosnian territory, after the shelling of Sarajevo market by Serb gunmen in which 37 people died and at least 80 were wounded. Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, denounced the bombardment as ""cruel"". The Serbian government announced that if would form a joint team with the Bosnian Serbs to hold peace negotiations.
The Georgian leader, Edward Shevardnadze, narrowly escaped assassination after a car bomb exploded in the capital, Tbilisi. He was on his way to the signing ceremony of a new constitution which gives the elected president wide new powers. Within hours, he declared he would stand for the post in November.
Alain Madelin, the newish French finance minister, who wanted to cut welfare spending and public-sector pensions, was forced to resign. He was replaced by Jean Arthuis. And after 12 years as Switzerland's finance minister, Otto Stich, is to retire, tired of fighting growing federal debts.
Germany's opposition leader, Rudolf Scharping, struggled to retain authority in his Social Democratic party. He removed his ambitious rival, Gerhard Schroder, the premier of Lower Saxony, from his post as economics spokesman for the party.
The Polish president, Lech Walesa, sacked his long-time top aide, Mieczyslaw Wachowski, his ping-pong partner and former driver accused of misconduct and intrigues. Mr Walesa hopes to silence some of his critics before his bid for re-election this autumn.
As Northern Ireland cautiously celebrated a year-long ceasefire, James Molyneaux, the 75-year-old leader of Northern Ireland's Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, resigned. Since the launch in February of the Anglo-Irish framework document for peace in Northern Ireland, which Unionists say betrayed them, Mr Molyneaux has been under pressure to go.
On the block
Pete Wilson, the governor of California, officially announced that he was running for the Republican presidential nomination. Bob Dole, shifting to the right in his own campaign, returned the money he had previously solicited from a gay Republican group.
The retrial began of Lyle and Erik Menendez, charged with murdering their parents in Beverly Hills. In 1994, two separate juries could not decide whether to convict them of murder or manslaughter.
Senator Bob Packwood, accused of sexual and official misconduct, changed his mind and called for public hearings on the subject. His wish seemed likely to be granted.
Regress and progress
Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated government rid itself of the prime minister and three other Hutu ministers (and a Tutsi). Zaire set December 31st as the date by which all Rwandan refugees (most of them Hutus) must leave the country voluntarily or be deported.
The leaders of 12 southern African countries, meeting for the first time in Johannesburg, planned to give new life to the Southern African Development Community. The aim is a free-trade zone by 2000.
Israel's attorney-general ruled that the statute of limitations barred any trials of Israeli soldiers who might be accused of killing Egyptian prisoners-of-war. A former brigadier admits ordering the killing of 49 prisoners in 1956; an Israeli historian believes 1,000 prisoners were killed in 1967. Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, is calling for an investigation.

LIKE Mike Tyson's comeback fight, it was over before it began. Barring the intervention of a surprise candidate, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the minister for trade and industry, has won by default the contest to lead the Liberal Democratic Party. Since the LDP is the governing coalition's largest member, Mr Hashimoto is, according to every political pundit from boardroom to barroom, prime-minister-in-waiting, The pundits may be right. But he could still be waiting a while.
Mr Hashimoto's victory came on August 28th when Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister and the LDP's current leader, threw in the towel without even officially declaring his candidacy. Victory's foundations, however, were laid two months earlier with Japan's trade deal on cars and car parts with America. Then, Mr Hashimoto successfully fended off an American threat to place a huge tariff on imports of luxury cars from Japan, without conceding any quantifiable promises in return. This triumph boosted Mr Hashimoto's already high popularity with the voters in general, and with ordinary members of the LDP in particular. Since those ordinary members command 151 of the 461 votes in the electoral college for the party's presidency, Mr Kono started to look vulnerable.
Mr Hashimoto rode his wave of popularity superbly, using it to break up the existing pattern of factions in the LDP and change it more to his liking. Though the party's five factions were formally abolished last year, they are still very much alive. Mr Kono had the backing of three of them, giving him 164 supposedly safe votes.
Some backbenchers, however, feared Mr Kono might cost them their seats (the latest opinion poll suggests 27% of respondents would like to see Mr Hashimoto as the next prime minister, compared with only 11% wanting Mr Kono); they started to defect. The LDP's indifferent showing in July's election for the Diet's upper house accelerated this trend. Soon nobody wanted to be left behind. On August 22nd, 69 LDP members of the Diet formed a cross-faction group called ""Hashimoto for LDP President"". The two largest Kono-supporting factions lost 28 of their members and a third small one seceded altogether.
Faced with humiliation, Mr Kono pulled out. With his honour intact, he may be able to keep a reasonably senior job in the Hashimoto era. Certainly, Mr Hashimoto might be wise to hold on to him: popular as the new leader is among voters, his coalition partners despise him.
Three's company
The difficulty is that Mr Hashimoto would need the support of all three parties in the governing coalition. He may now be leader-presumptive of the strongest leg of the governing tripod (the other two are the Social Democratic Party and the New Harbinger Party), but he is not strong enough to kick the other legs away.
Mr Hashimoto's problem, at least as far as his coalition partners are concerned, is that he is a nationalist. He thinks, as his confrontation with the Americans showed, that Japan should stop clinging to America's skins and start playing a more active role in the world. He believes in revising the constitution so that the country can formally abandon the pretence of a self-effacing ""Self-Defence Force"". He wants Japan to have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. And, as chairman of the Japan War Bereaved Families Association, he is not terribly keen on official apologies for Japan's wartime activities.
Such nationalistic sentiments make him an uncomfortable partner for Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister and leader of the Social Democrats. Mr Murayama is a pacifist who recently made what may or may not have been an unequivocal apology for Japanese misdemeanours before 1945. The third member of the triumvirate, Masayoshi Takemura (finance minister and leader of the New Harbinger Party), does not like Mr Hashimoto much either. Such different partners seem ill-suited. Yet for Mr Hashimoto to ditch his allies and go to the country might be a mistake: the latest Nikkei poll shows only 32% of respondents saying they would vote for the LDP.
In any event, engineering a rapid election to the Diet's lower house (where the power lies) would not look very statesman-like. Though given a breathing-space by the weakening of the yen, Japan's economy still looks exhausted. Any election would have to wait at least until after the second supplementary budget in October, when a fiscal stimulus of more than Y10 trillion is expected (though actual new spending is likely to be Y3 trillion-5 trillion). And by the time that is through the Diet, the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, to be held in Japan in November, would be looming. Cabinet ministers will be too busy bathing in reflected glory to campaign.
But waiting until 1996 to assume the prime ministership would be risky. If a week is a long time in politics, six months is an eternity, and there is no guarantee that even if he waits that long Mr Hashimoto's personality would carry the LDP to outright power in a general election. One event in particular could at his calculations: the coalition might collapse of its own accord. The Social Democrats have looked ready to implode for months. They might choose to do so at their convention on September 21st, leaving the prime minister without a party. If so, Mr Hashimoto would have no choice but to step into the breach, possibly patching up a coalition with the opposition New Frontier Party (NFP), the political vehicle of his old rival, Ichiro Ozawa.
If this does not happen, Mr Hashimoto will probably imitate his rival's strategy. Mr Ozawa assembled the NFP by patiently encouraging defections from the LDP. Mr Hashimoto is likely to try to pay him back by offering the possibility of real power as a lure to get some of the defectors to turn their coats again. The realignment of Japanese politics is not over yet.","TOKYO

AFTER years of torpor in the face of the bad debts building up in Japan's financial sector, the Ministry of Finance is suddenly hyperactive. Last week it rushed in to close two wobbly financial institutions before market forces toppled them. Now it is talking seriously about sorting out the mess at the country's housing-loan companies (the jusen), which provide 17% of all domestic mortgages not subsidised by the government. A report on the jusen problem is to be delayed a mere month; Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, has announced that an interim version should be ready by October (the previous target was late September) with the final version to appear in December.
To be fair to the ministry it has not, as it has with the wider banking crisis, attempted to disguise the scale of the problem. Collectively, the seven jusen have managed to build up bad loans of some Y6.1 trillion ($62.4 billion), of which an impressive Y3.6 trillion is reckoned by the finance ministry to be irrecoverable. It estimates that the total cost of making the mess vanish will come to Y4.6 trillion. The question is who will pay for this financial disappearing trick.
The jusen were set up by Japan's big banks in the early 1970s. For a decade or so they plied their humble trade of housing the growing populations of Japan's industrial cities. Then, like so many other Japanese financial institutions, they saw the price of land rising and got greedy--lending to speculative ventures such as golf courses and car parks. It is the collapse of the collateral to these loans, rather than any failure in their basic mortgage business, that is threatening to bring them down.
That they have not failed so far is because, unlike mortgage providers in many other countries, they do not take retail deposits, so they cannot be destroyed by a panicky run, as happened with Cosmo, a credit union, in July, and was threatening to happen with Kizu, another credit union, before the finance ministry stepped in on August 30th. Instead, their creditors are institutions, such as life-insurance companies.
In other countries, regulators might have been tempted to let these investors foot the bill. The problem is that Japan's 2,600 agricultural co-operatives were also big investors in the jusen. And one of the golden Japanese political rules is: ""don't monkey with the farmers"" (hence the rice price-fixing racket that the government dignifies with the name ""The Basic Food Law""). So it looks as though taxpayers are going to be forced to wave their magic wand.
What will probably happen, according to Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at the Japanese arm of Moan Stanley, an American investment bank, is a merger of the jusen into two viable companies, with the bad debts stripped out into a Japanese equivalent of the Resolution Trust that bailed out America's thrift industry. The reason for the delay in announcing the details seems to be a power struggle between the finance and agriculture ministries. If the Ministry of Finance provides the money to bail out the co-operatives, it can dictate the terms. These are likely to include finance ministry (rather than agriculture ministry) oversight of their financial activities.
The finance ministry's bureaucrats want to await the enthronement of Ryutaro Hashimoto, the all-but-elected leader of the Liberal Democrats (the principal governing parcy), before writing the report. Mr Hashimoto just happens to be a former finance minister. The agriculture bureaucrats want action (or at least words) now. For the moment it looks as though the finance ministry is winning. The Japanese people most certainly are not.","TOKYO

Now it is talking seriously about sorting out the mess at the country 's housing - loan companies ( the jusen ) , which provide 17 % of all domestic mortgages not subsidised by the government . A report on the jusen problem is to be delayed a mere month ; Masayoshi Takemura , the finance minister , has announced that an interim version should be ready by October ( the previous target was late September ) with the final version to appear in December . 
 To be fair to the ministry it has not , as it has with the wider banking crisis , attempted to disguise the scale of the problem . Collectively , the seven jusen have managed to build up bad loans of some Y6.1 trillion ( $ 62.4 billion ) , of which an impressive Y3.6 trillion is reckoned by the finance ministry to be irrecoverable . It estimates that the total cost of making the mess vanish will come to Y4.6 trillion . The question is who will pay for this financial disappearing trick . 
 The jusen were set up by Japan 's big banks in the early 1970s . For a decade or so they plied their humble trade of housing the growing populations of Japan 's industrial cities . Then , like so many other Japanese financial institutions , they saw the price of land rising and got greedy -- lending to speculative ventures such as golf courses and car parks . It is the collapse of the collateral to these loans , rather than any failure in their basic mortgage business , that is threatening to bring them down . 
 That they have not failed so far is because , unlike mortgage providers in many other countries , they do not take retail deposits , so they can not be destroyed by a panicky run , as happened with Cosmo , a credit union , in July , and was threatening to happen with Kizu , another credit union , before the finance ministry stepped in on August 30th . Instead , their creditors are institutions , such as life - insurance companies . 
 In other countries , regulators might have been tempted to let these investors foot the bill . The problem is that Japan 's 2,600 agricultural co - operatives were also big investors in the jusen . And one of the golden Japanese political rules is : "" do n't monkey with the farmers "" ( hence the rice price - fixing racket that the government dignifies with the name "" The Basic Food Law "" ) . So it looks as though taxpayers are going to be forced to wave their magic wand . 
 What will probably happen , according to Mineko Sasaki - Smith , an economist at the Japanese arm of Moan Stanley , an American investment bank , is a merger of the jusen into two viable companies , with the bad debts stripped out into a Japanese equivalent of the Resolution Trust that bailed out America 's thrift industry . The reason for the delay in announcing the details seems to be a power struggle between the finance and agriculture ministries . If the Ministry of Finance provides the money to bail out the co - operatives , it can dictate the terms . These are likely to include finance ministry ( rather than agriculture ministry ) oversight of their financial activities . 
 The finance ministry 's bureaucrats want to await the enthronement of Ryutaro Hashimoto , before writing the report . Ryutaro Hashimoto just happens to be a former finance minister . The agriculture bureaucrats want action ( or at least words ) now . For the moment it looks as though the finance ministry is winning . The Japanese people most certainly are not .",740,Japan,A29-8197,PRE TERM,True,"Ryutaro Hashimoto , the all - but - elected leader of the Liberal Democrats ( the principal governing parcy )",2,True

RYUTARO HASHIMOTO did not have to fight to launch himself in politics. When his father died in 1963, he inherited a vote-gathering machine that propelled him smoothly into Japan's parliament at the tender age of 26. His marriage, three years later, was brokered by none other than Japan's then prime minister. Powerful friends and an early start are handy assets in Japan's political world, where patronage and patience are the keys to promotion.
Mr Hashimoto held his first cabinet post in 1978. And, at mid-week, it seemed all but certain that he would be elected president of his Liberal Democratic Party on September 22nd. Since the LDP dominates the coalition government, Mr Hashimoto has become more powerful than Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's socialist prime minister. On the wall of Mr Hashimoto's office hangs a photograph of Naples, where last year's G7 summit was held. ""That"", he points out, ""is where Mr Murayama got an upset stomach.""
When he was first elected to parliament, Mr Hashimoto attended some of his first meetings accompanied by his stepmother. These days the mummy's boy has grown up. He teases visitors in a playful way, deflecting questions. As minister of trade, Mr Hashimoto to enjoyed baiting the Americans during this year's row about cars. He appeared at one meeting in a green leather suit. He said that negotiating with Mickey Kantor, his American foe, was as scaly as facing the fury of his wife when he came home late and tipsy.
Provocation, in short, is the trade minister's trademark. He swaggers rather than walks, and frequently loses his temper. Ordinary Japanese, especially women, find him lovably tough, but Mr Hashimoto's style has won him few friends among his parliamentary colleagues, even though they have chosen him as their leader. The choice reflects changes in Japan, both in domestic politics and in foreign policy.
The LDP used to avoid having flamboyant leaders. Power resided with grey faction chiefs; who pulled strings attached to faceless prime ministers. The facelessness did not matter, because the LDP had no particular need to court voters with televisual charm: it could buy support, and its socialist opponents were too extreme to be electable. In 1993, however, the LDP split. The defectors were among the founders of the New Frontier Party, which did better than the LDP in July's election for the upper house of parliament.
The new electoral challenge has shifted power from the LDP's faction chiefs to its charismatic vote-pullers. This change is reinforced by last year's reform of the electoral system for parliament's lower house. In the past, four or five candidates were elected from each constituency, the last of whom often scraped into parliament with a mere 15% of the votes. To muster such modest support, it was enough to distribute cash diligently; and marshalling cash was what the faction chiefs were good at. Under the new electoral system, by contrast, only one candidate will be elected from each constituency. It is impossible to buy that many votes. Poise and charm are necessary.
So, perhaps, are flashy policies. The local elections in April showed that voters like candidates who espouse bold ideas. The new governor of Tokyo, for example, is an independent who promised to cancel the vastly expensive Tokyo Expo, despite the protests of firms that had already poured money into the project. Over the past month Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, has doubled the popularity of his small party by protesting loudly against French nuclear tests. Junichiro Koizumi, Mr Hashimoto's rival for the leadership, grabbed the limelight recently by proposing the privatisation of Japan's postal savings system.
In a country renowned for consensus, radical views have become political assets. Mr Hashimoto strikes a nationalist pose. He defies Mr Kantor. He plays down the need to apologise for Japan's belligerent past. He wants to scrap the pacifist clause of Japan's constitution. In a book published two years ago, Mr Hashimoto declared that Japan and the West are separated by a ""gap in national spirit"".
The Japanese are in the mood to support this kind of talk. Demoralised by half a decade of economic loom, they long for strong leadership. Humiliated by the 50th anniversary of their defeat in war, they savour victories of any kindsome real, like the refusal to concede American trade demands; others imaginary, such as the film released in the week of VJ day, which showed samurai in victorious combat against American cowboys.
Mr Hashimoto plays to this feeling, but he is not a dangerous radical. Unprompted, he praises America's military role in Asia. Although prompted several times, he refuses to sound anti-western. Yet, even though he maybe moderate inside, his nationalist cloak is too useful to discard. The prime minister who fell sick in Naples seems likely to be dumped soon, and next year will probably bring a general election. If the voters' nationalism proves strong, the LDP may win enough votes to form a government of its own, with Mr Hashimoto as prime minister. Even if it does not, populism will keep Japanese politics lively.","Ryutaro Hashimoto did not have to fight to launch Ryutaro Hashimoto in politics .

COUNTRIES as well as people can experience mid-life crises. Around 1900, when Britain's youthful progress gave way to relative decline, its leaders were overcome by anxiety about the physique. of the working classes. Now Japan is gripped by a similar sense that the country is in moral and physical decline. Sparked by recession, an earthquake and a murderous sect, pessimism has singed nearly all aspects of life.
Consider, for example, a survey conducted during the summer by Hakuhodo, an advertising agency. This found that popular faith in thing as various as money, the afterlife and psychic powers were all on the wane. Only 23% of respondents thought Japan was stable, down from 40% three years ago. Half reckoned the country was in decline.
Faith in government has declined fastest of all. The old confidence that bureaucrats could steer the economy has ceded to a popular hatred of regulation. Retired mandarins complain of a decline of both morale and morality within the civil service. The Japanese were recently shocked by a corruption scandal involving a top official in the Ministry of Finance--the pinnacle of the bureaucracy. Corruption is expected from politicians, but was once unheard of among top bureaucrats.
In most areas of life, people agree that Japan's post-war formula no longer works, but change makes everyone nervous. In politics, voters booted out the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party two years ago, but many now want the old guard back again. In business, everybody knows that lifetime employment is under strain, but nobody knows how to replace it. Even dress codes are in perplexing flux. Several firms have told office workers to abandon their conformist blue suits one day a week, and to dress as individualists. Shops have set up special stalls to advise bewildered managers on how to go about this.
The symptoms of stress are as various as the causes. Newspapers lugubriously report statistics on which of Tokyo's rail lines is most popular for suicides. Therapists, hitherto rare in Japan, are multiplying. Religious sects flourish by offering disoriented Japanese a sense of purpose. Books predicting armageddon sell well. Last month a long editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest newspaper, bemoaned the country's post-war material advance, which is ""threatening to ruin our very existence"". Forests have been chopped down; the air has been polluted; even the physical and mental health of Japanese is deteriorating.
In Britain it was the medical examination of conscripts for the Boer war that provoked alarm about national physique. In Japan, peacetime health tests provide the Yomiuri's pessimists with ample evidence to o on. Each year 18-year-olds are made to touch their toes and, if possible, reach beyond them. In 1984 boys stretched on average 14.4 centimetres beyond their toes; a decade later they managed only 11.4. Over the same period the strength of boys' grip has declined by 4.8%, their capacity for sit-ups by 10.6%. Eleven-year-old girls can jump a shocking ten centimetres less far than did their forebears 12 years ago.
The Yomiuri blames cultural change. Deteriorating eye-sight proves that children are playing too many video games, and that their diets are mushy--less chewing means weaker facial muscles, the paper suggests, which may impair the eye's ability to focus. General feebleness can be blamed on a deteriorating, and westernising, diet. Japan's biggest restaurant chain is McDonald's.
Likewise, allergies are on the rise. The Yomiuri says this may reflect ""excessive cleanliness"". Japan's traditional fondness for washing has recently reached neurotic extremes: shops tout germ-free pens, bicycle handles and telephones, all impregnated with antiseptic chemicals. Meanwhile, the declining vigour of youth betrays how examinations are crowding out hearty games. The Yomiuri's editorial commends the Boy Scout movement (which was founded in Britain in 1908 to improve the robustness of the young. But the number of Boy Scouts in Japan has plummeted from 308,000 to 235,000 since 1980.
There is doubtless reason for concern, but Japan's gloom seems exaggerated. Some evidence suggests that all is not lost: the pulse rate of 18-year-olds after a bout of stair-climbing rises less than it did a decade ago.
In part, all this gloom may reflect a traditional penchant for melancholy noticeable in Japanese literature. But a political agenda may also underlie it. If people think the nation is enfeebled, they may be keener to support tough policies and politicians. The Yomiuri, the voice of conservative Japan, is campaigning to abolish the pacifist clause in Japan's constitution which, it says, undermines the dignity of the army. A more vigorous foreign policy may need more vigorous citizens. Hence the calls for sport in schools to foster the manly virtues associated with Japan's faded martial spirit.
If any leading politician embodies this sort of thinking, it is Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democrats' new leader. Mr Hashimoto is a tough guy, who stands up to foreigners and wants to revise the pacifist clauses of the constitution. He is also a devotee of kendo, or Japanese swordsmanship. He may thrive on Japan's sense of malaise.","TOKYO

He is backed by the Soka Gakkai, a huge Buddhist organisation. New Frontier officials expect a turnout of 1m voters. Soka Gakkai claims a membership many times that size.
An Ozawa victory would present an intriguing paradox. Mr Ozawa is an old-style party hack, adept at backroom deals and barely legal fundraising. Yet he is also the closest approximation to a statesman that Japan has, and in this he may represent the future. By leading a band of reformists out of the Liberal Democratic Party in 1993, he replaced the LDP'S unchanging domination with a two-party system. By pushing through electoral reform last year, he buried the old rules that fostered money politics and discouraged policy discussion.

EVEN well-informed foreigners often find it hard to name the prime minister of Japan: incumbents tend to have a short shelf life and a weak brand image. Ryutaro Hashimoto is likely to change that. He is tough and outspoken, and has a flair for publicity (he makes much of his taste for martial arts). Japanese voters, particularly women, apparently like his swaggering ways. As prime minister and as leader of the Liberal Democractic Party (LDP), Mr Hashimoto will provide Japan with a new sense of leadership.
Unfortunately, Mr Hashimoto's novelty has more to do with style than substance. Some foreigners, noting his combative stance in trade talks with America last year and his links with Japan's ex-servicemen, worry that Mr Hashimoto will introduce a new note of nationalism into Japanese politics. In fact, in foreign policy as in everything else, Mr Hashimoto's policies are likely to lie firmly within the Japanese post-war consensus. Far from being dangerously radical, he is dangerously conservative.
Why dangerously? Because the Japanese economy and political system are in real need of reform. Four years of negligible economic growth and financial parlousness have revealed the flaws in the Japanese miracle. The iron triangle of bureaucrats, LDP politicians and lobby groups has left Japan with an overregulated, high-cost economy. Even when the Japanese system was producing supercharged economic growth, it failed to deliver many of the benefits to ordinary Japanese consumers. Now it is barely delivering growth itself.
The new Japanese prime minister faces a choice. He can continue to place his faith in the old system and take heart from the signs that the economy is picking up. Or he can take on the lobbyists and bureaucrats, deregulate the economy and decentralise the government. Mr Hashimoto says he favours deregulation. But so do all Japanese politicians these days. Compare Mr Hashimoto's writings with those of his chief political rival, Ichiro Ozawa (see page 35), and it is clear that he has a much more limited view of reform. He is the standard-bearer of those who still keep faith in the status quo.
 Defenders of the current way of doing things point out that for 30 years the Japanese system produced an economic miracle that dazzled the world. It would be absurd, they say, to indulge in radical reforms just because of one long recession.
The enduring strengths of the Japanese economy are indeed formidable: Japan is still home to many of the most competitive companies in the world (see page 59). But those who believe that clinches the argument against deregulation miss a crucial point. Japan's world-beating companies, the Toyotas and Sonys, operate in the least regulated parts of the Japanese economy. They face fierce competition and hordes of competitors, at home as well as abroad. By contrast, the least efficient industries, such as farming and telecoms, are also the most protected. Because they are cosseted, they have not kept up with world standards: witness the way Japan has fallen behind in developing multimedia products, which marry electronics and telecoms. If Japan fails to deregulate, these inefficient industries will continue to hold the economy back.
Even many of Japan's bureaucrats, who have a natural interest in retaining the regulations that are the source of their power, have begun to acknowledge the problems with the current system. Japan's Economic Planning Agency recently published two projections for economic growth over the next five years. With deregulation, it reckons that the economy will grow by 3% a year. Without deregulation, it will be just 1.75%.
 Mr Hashimoto understands the case for setting the economy free. But vigorous deregulation would mean taking on his allies: the bureaucrats at the Ministries of Finance and International Trade and Industry (both former Hashimoto fiefs) and the industrial lobbies. Industries like farming, building and transport have traditionally financed the LDP and their contributions will be needed at the next election.
A choice, at last
Such considerations are likely to mute Mr Hashimoto's enthusiasm for reform. But his elevation to the prime ministership is still welcome for another reason. Now that Mr Ozawa has become leader of the opposition, it means that Japan's two foremost political figures have stepped out of the shadows and will square up openly at the next election. Japanese voters will then face a novel and welcome situation: a real choice between two strong and articulate leaders, manipulated by no one. And that, more than anything, will open the path to change.","Japan needs a reforming prime minister .

Forceful, charismatic and with hair so heavily oiled that a typhoon could not ruffle it, he beamed telegenically when voted into the top job by Japan's ruling coalition on January 11th.
Admired for his detailed grasp of policy and his spirited defiance of the Americans in trade talks last year, Mr Hashimoto offers a pleasing contrast to Tomchi Murayama, the outgoing prime minister, who resigned on January 5th for reasons of incompetence. ""I did my best... but in some ways, I've been working above the limits of my own ability,"" the 71-year-old socialist shrewdly observed as he stepped down.
Mr Hashimoto's rise heralds two changes, both welcome. The first is the death of Japan's socialists, who these days call themselves (in English, though not in Japanese) Social Democrats. The second, and more significant, is the gradual replacement of pork-barrel politics with genuine debate.
First, the epitaph. For almost half a century, Japan's Socialist Party was the world's most pointless opposition grouping, never winning a majority in parliament and exerting negligible influence over policy. Appealing as it did to Marxists, trade unionists, sympathisers with North Korea and other interest groups spurned by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Socialist Party used to attract a small but dedicated following. But when Mr Murayama ditched virtually all its policies as the price of joining a ruling coalition with the LDP in 1994, he alienated the party's traditional supporters without gaining new ones.
The party will probably continue cynically to back the LDP-led coalition government until the next election, which must be held by July 1997. One of their number, Wataru Kubo, has been appointed finance minister in Mr Hashimoto's new administration. Socialist politicians need, after all, to save up for their dotage, and Japanese MPS are quite well paid. When the polls come, most of the socialists will be forcibly retired.
That much is clear. But who will win the next election is less so. The choice is between Mr Hashimoto's LDP and the New Frontier Party, led by Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP strategist who defected in 1993.
Mr Ozawa's departure from the LDP brought to an end 38 years of unbroken conservative rule. It also enabled him, as the brains behind a patchwork coalition government, to pass an electoral-reform bill that replaced Japan's corrupt old multimember electoral constituencies with a mixture of single-member, first-past-thepost seats and others filled by proportional representation. Mr Ozawa's coalition fell apart in 1994 when the Socialist Party, then one of his allies, changed sides to team up with the LDP. But his electoral reforms remain in place, forcing would-be MPS to talk policy rather than pork.
 For the first time, the public has a choice between two heavyweight party leaders with clearly different manifestos. Superficially, Messrs Ozawa and Hashimoto have heaps in common. Both are the relatively young (Mr Ozawa is 53, Mr Hashimoto 58) sons of politicians, and both rose to prominence under the tutelage of a former prime minister, Kakuei Tanaka. Both have a reputation for arrogance.
Here the parallels cease. Mr Hashimoto's father was one of the know-all bureaucratic elite before becoming a politician. His son is cosy with the main ministries and sympathetic to their pleas that deregulation should be slow and gentle.
Mr Ozawa's dad was an outsider, a former rickshaw-puller who rose to ministerial office through force of intellect and a talent for raising money. Ozawa junior proved even more adept at attracting funds-he reputedly once collected Y25 billion ($238m now) in a single day. A past spent in smokefilled rooms will not appeal to the electorate, but Mr Ozawa's strength is that, unlike Mr Hashimoto, he has thought long and deep about how Japan needs to change.
 Mr Hashimoto's 1993 book, ""Vision of Japan"", was a limp agglomeration of self-justifying anecdotes and turgidly excessive detail, pushing no platform more radical than that of tinkering with the status quo. Mr Ozawa's ""Blueprint for a New Japan"", on the other hand, calls for nothing less than the demolition of the country's long tradition of bureaucratic control of more or less everything.
Mr Ozawa describes how, on a visit to the Grand Canyon, he noticed with amazement that there were no warning signs at the edge. In Japan, there would have been hundreds of signs, a stout fence and dozens of park keepers counselling caution. The Japanese have not yet learned to take responsibility for themselves, laments Mr Ozawa, and expect the government to coddle them.
""Real democracy"", Mr Ozawa writes, ""begins with...the autonomy of the individual."" For Japan to become a ""normal nation"" (his phrase), it needs an accountable government and a laisser faire economy. He promises to break the rule of the mandarins, with their unignorable ""advice"" to business and their selfserving interpretation of ambiguously drafted regulations. Mr Hashimoto, by contrast, pays lip service to the need for deregulation, but finds horrifying the idea of, say, market forces applied to health care or an end to farm subsidies. Mr Ozawa promises radical tax reform. He would like, he says, a startling 50% reduction in income tax, offset by a rise in consumption tax from 3% to 10% over ten years. He talks of ""aggressively opening Japan's own markets"" and strengthening the post of prime minister to slash the power of unelected bureaucrats.
The run-up to the next election will see charge and counter-charge. The LDP will try to discredit Mr Ozawa by playing up his party's links to the rich, powerful and widely detested Soka Gakkai religious sect, whose 8m members provide the largest chunk of the New Frontier Party's support. Many voters do not like the idea of a government influenced by the Buddhist group's dictatorial leader, Daisaku Ikeda. The LDP hopes to keep Mr Ikeda in the spotlight by summoning him to give evidence in parliament about his finances.
Mr Ozawa's counter-attack will be aimed at the government's plan to use over Y600 billion in taxpayers' money to liquidate seven jusen (housing loan corporations) that were buried in bad debt when property prices collapsed in the early 1990s. The scheme is as popular as cockroach sushi, partly because it will use public funds to rescue speculators who should have known what risks they were facing, and partly because it looks as though the LDP is yet again placing rural interests above urban ones. Many of the creditors to be compensated are farm co-operatives; electorally over-represented farmers are staunch LDP supporters. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister at the time the jusen made their most disastrous loans. Mr Ozawa can be counted upon to make sure that voters remember this.","UNLIKE most of Ryutaro Hashimoto's predecessors as prime minister of Japan , Ryutaro Hashimoto actually looks like a leader .

ASKED whether he had ever conducted the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, the late, great Sir Thomas Beecham replied that he had not, but that he had trodden in some once. If anything, the Japanese have even less regard for their bankers, and the regulators that were supposed to oversee them, than Sir Thomas had for the avantgarde German composer.
Japanese taxpayers have become ever more furious at having to pay for the bad loans their banks made before the bursting of the country's bubble economy in 1990. Their anger has grown since December, when the finance ministry unveiled the first stage of a plan to help banks tackle these. This called for some Y685 billion ($6.5 billion) of public money to bail out seven allbut-bankrupt jusen, or mortgage lenders, to which both the banks and agricultural cooperatives had lent heavily.
Under the second stage of the bail-out, finalised this week, a new body will buy Y6.8 trillion of jusen assets that may eventually be worth something. This purchase will be paid for by raising new loans from the banks and co-ops. Only if the value of the old assets turns out to equal the cost of the new loans will there be no extra burden on the taxpayer.
This is hardly likely. Even the finance ministry admits that Y1.2 trillion of the old assets are probably irrecoverable, and the government is guaranteeing half of the new loans. So taxpayers will almost certainly have to stump up more. If none of the assets are recovered, the public will, at a conservative estimate, have had to pay Y5.5 trillion to rescue the jusen-though much of this loss would only appear in 15 years' time, when the new body is wound up. Opinion polls show that 72% of Japanese are against bailing out the jusen. Ichiro Ozawa, the new leader of the main opposition party, Shinshinto, this week urged the government of Ryutaro Hashimoto to drop the rescue package from the budget until responsibility for the losses was clarified.
One reason for the strength of public opposition is that, whereas the agricultural cooperatives, which just happen to be chummy with the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest in the coalition government, will get most of their dud loans back, the banks will have to write off all of the Y5.2 trillion they lent. Moreover, much of the jusen's lending, it transpires, was to property firms controlled by the yakuza, Japan's mafia.
Mr Hashimoto has sworn to root out and punish those responsible for the banking mess-a rash promise, since he was finance minister when the jusen lent particularly recklessly. He also promised to publish more details of the debacle. But a lengthy statistical tome on jusen lending released by the finance ministry on January 19th prompted more questions than it answered about what went wrong.
Why, for example, did the country's regulators not worry that most of the jusen loans had nothing to do with mortgages? By 1987, outstanding loans to (mostly property) companies were greater than those to individuals. Indeed, by 1994 only 8% of the loans of one jusen, Sogo Jukin, were to individuals. And, despite a ban on further property-related lending by banks in 1990, lending by mortgage companies surged: that year, their lending increased by 22%, before falling the following year, albeit slowly.
Other details, such as the names of the corporate borrowers and the fact that 38 former finance ministry officials now occupy senior positions at the mortgage lenders, have leaked out via the press. When the ministry clamped restrictions on property lending by banks, most of the jusen had either a chairman or a president who was a former finance ministry official.
The real bill
Yet the row over the rescue has obscured two big points. The first is that Japan's banking system as a whole has seen profits rise sharply. Because Japanese banks' accounts are pretty opaque, analysts generally look at the part of their books that can be least easily manipulated: operating profits. These have been soaring lately (see chart on next page). The Bank of Japan has pushed interest rates to historically low levels, which has allowed banks to borrow for almost nothing and then charge much higher rates when lending. Falling interest rates have also swelled profits on their bond portfolios and on interest-rate swaps.
The second point is that Japanese banks have been enjoying massive tax breaks. Over the past three years they have offset much of the 50% corporate tax that they would otherwise have paid on their profits with apparent, but not actual, realised losses from their non-performing loans.
The distinction is an important one. At the beginning of 1993 the banks created a body called the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (ccPc). This is an officially approved accounting wheeze: in order to claim tax relief on provisions against bad loans, Japanese banks have, in theory, to crystallise those losses by, for example, making borrowers bankrupt or by selling their loans. But, in many cases, they could not or did not want to do so.
By ""selling"" loans to the CCPC (ie, to themselves), the banks can realise losses and get the associated tax relief. By last September they had sold loans with a total face value of just under Y10 trillion to the CCPC, which paid Y4.3 trillion for them. Since all of the loss is tax-deductible, they received a Y2.9 trillion tax benefit. The CCPC'S boss expects to buy more loans with a face value of up to Y2 trillion by the end of the financial year, entitling banks to more relief.
 The finance ministry has allowed tax breaks for specific provisions against dud loans that have not been ""realised"", so long as the banks can show that they are very unlikely to get their money back. Although she stresses that the numbers are something of a guess, Betsy Daniels, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, an American investment bank, reckons that about 40% of the Y5.1 trillion of specific provisions taken by Japan's 21 city (or commercial) banks between April 1991 and September 1995 would have been taxdeductible-implying a tax bonus for banks of some Y1 trillion.
How much tax relief the banks will eventually receive in return for writing off their jusen loans is unclear. Most analysts think that they will be able to set all of the loss against tax, which Ms Daniels calculates would lead to another Y2.6 trillion in tax relief. So by the end of March, the banks may well have enjoyed a total of some Y7 trillion in tax benefits.
There is an argument that the ministry is merely bringing forward tax relief for loans that would have eventually been written off anyway, and that the cost to the taxpayer will therefore be lower in the long run. But David Atkinson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, another American investment bank, argues that banks have benefited far more than this. In most countries, such relief would be given only when banks refinanced the firms to which they had lent, thereby realising a loss. In Japan, says Mr Atkinson, ""not a single borrower has been refinanced in any way."" Having already received tax relief on their loss, banks have little incentive to help borrowers out.
Why did the finance ministry not insist that banks restructure companies' finances by, say, converting debt into equity? The ministry's poor excuse is that this would create a moral hazard, giving other borrowers an incentive to default.
It is a bit rich for Japan's financial bureaucrats to talk about moral hazard when it was their own implicit guarantee of the banking system that encouraged banks to take such big risks in the first place. Moreover, by refusing to insist on a refinancing of troubled borrowers, the finance ministry has ensured that the indebtedness of the property and construction industries remains high. Altogether, says Mr Atkinson, these employ 7m people, and their debts amount to 26% of Japan's GDP. Without refinancing, the sectors will remain crippled, hampering any economic recovery. In short, Japan has a debt crisis, but it lies in the real economy, not the banking sector. No wonder the Japanese are cross.","Plans to help troubled Japanese banks with public money have caused a public outcry . With just cause 
 ASKED whether he had ever conducted the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen , the late , great Sir Thomas Beecham replied that he had not , but that he had trodden in some once . If anything , the Japanese have even less regard for their bankers , and the regulators that were supposed to oversee them , than Sir Thomas had for the avantgarde German composer . 
 Japanese taxpayers have become ever more furious at having to pay for the bad loans their banks made before the bursting of the country 's bubble economy in 1990 . Their anger has grown since December , when the finance ministry unveiled the first stage of a plan to help banks tackle these . This called for some Y685 billion ( $ 6.5 billion ) of public money to bail out seven allbut - bankrupt jusen , or mortgage lenders , to which both the banks and agricultural cooperatives had lent heavily . 
 Under the second stage of the bail - out , finalised this week , a new body will buy Y6.8 trillion of jusen assets that may eventually be worth something . This purchase will be paid for by raising new loans from the banks and co - ops . Only if the value of the old assets turns out to equal the cost of the new loans will there be no extra burden on the taxpayer . 
 This is hardly likely . Even the finance ministry admits that Y1.2 trillion of the old assets are probably irrecoverable , and Ryutaro Hashimoto is guaranteeing half of the new loans . So taxpayers will almost certainly have to stump up more . If none of the assets are recovered , the public will , at a conservative estimate , have had to pay Y5.5 trillion to rescue the jusen - though much of this loss would only appear in 15 years ' time , when the new body is wound up .

Come April, when Mr Clinton travels to Tokyo for a more formal summit meeting, it should be confident smiles all round. Assuming Mr Clinton makes it this time-he had to cancel a Tokyo summit last November because of the budget deadlock in Washington-the two will jointly reaffirm the importance of the United StatesJapan alliance. The world's most powerful country and its richest ally will soon be back in easy step.
Or will they? Even as America and Japan have scrambled in recent months to recover their diplomatic poise, East Asia has been changing in ways that could spell yet more trouble ahead.
Mr Clinton and Mr Hashimoto will prefer to look on the bright side. Although there are still some legal wrinkles to the renewal of leases for America's military bases on the Japanese island of Okinawa, the wave of resentment that followed the rape of a schoolgirl last September by American servicemen is beginning to lessen. America has been working on a package of peace offerings-handing back some land on Okinawa, moving some military personnel to bases elsewhere in Japan-in the run up to the Clinton visit to Tokyo. Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus, a persistent irritant to America, has been falling sharply: according to the Japanese finance ministry this week, Japan's trade surplus with America fell to $1.55 billion in January, down from $3.9 billion in January 1995.
But reducing the frictions in bilateral relations is the easier part. Much harder, for both governments, is to work out how their reaffirmed alliance might work.
Though the changes in East Asia since the cold war ended have taken longer to show, the region has no shortage of spatsover rocks, reefs and the fish and energy resources in the surrounding seas. Moreover, after decades sheltering securely behind America's military shield, Japan must now contend with a much less settled neighbourhood: a pugnacious China, a troublingly erratic Russia and, eventually, a united Korea. It will take more than just America's military muscle to keep the neighbourhood secure.
Asked about the role Japan's alliance with America should play in all this, officials at Japan's foreign ministry explain that it remains vital to Japan's own defence, is a great stabiliser among the complex rivalries in the region and provides the reassurance that is needed, at home and abroad, if Japan is to play a more active role in regional and global affairs. A similar case is put in the new National Defence Programme Outline, published late last year (and replacing one of 1976 vintage), that provides the rationale for an imminent streamlining of Japan's Self Defence Forces. Yet to security watchers outside the ministries all this merely restates the obvious: the alliance is important to Japan. But what, they ask, will Japan's contribution to the alliance now be?
Unlike NATO, which is built on mutual defence commitments between the United States and Canada and their European allies, the America Japan security treaty is a one-sided affair: it commits America to defend Japan, not vice versa. Over the years, Japan has attempted to take up some of the security burden, by paying for much of the upkeep of American forces in Japan, by using its aid and diplomatic clout to bolster stability in East Asia and beyond, and by contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations, in Cambodia, Bosnia and, most recently, the Golan heights between Israel and Syria.
Beyond that, officials insist that the country's pacifist-sounding constitution rules out other sorts of collective security operations, including joint military activities with America, except where Japan's own security is directly threatened. Yet close watchers in Japan of the United States Congress fret that Japan is still doing too little to counter growing accusations of free-loading on America's defence budget. Theyworry that, in future,Japan's contribution is likely to be measured by American public opinion, not in the sort of ""soft"" security that Japan has specialised in thus far, but against the need for ""hard"" securitymeaning a readiness to use force, if necessary to cope with new threats in East Asia.
The potential for these is already in evidence. Japan may be determined to cross only words, not swords, with South Korea and China in the disputes over islands and fishing rights in the seas between them, but China's grab early last year for Philippineclaimed Mischief reef among the Spratly islands in the South China Sea showed that others will be more belligerent. China's war of words with Taiwan, which it claims as a renegade province, and its provocative military manoeuvres in the run-up to Taiwan's first democratic presidential election next month are forcing Japan to think about the hitherto almost unthinkable: what might Japan be asked by America to do, if America and China were to come to blows in the Taiwan straits?
Japan's diplomats hope fervently that China will not use force against Taiwan, and Mr Hashimoto will want to be sure that Mr Clinton takes no provocative action and keeps Japan fully informed. But it is these sorts of regional flare-ups, drawing in American military forces, that will really test Japan's commitment to the alliance with America, suggests Masashi Nishihara, of the National Institute for Defence Studies in Tokyo. Should it come to a conflict, with America's boys dying in the Taiwan straits, the professor argues, there would be strong pressure for Japan to reinterpret its narrow notion of self defence, since the alliance with America, and America's ability to play a security role in East Asia, is in the end more important to Japan than relations with China.
Yet officials claim that Japan's constitution leaves little room for manoeuvre, as they discovered three years ago when America asked Japan for logistical and other support in its confrontation with North Korea. Since then, an influential newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimun, has called for the constitution to be amended.
Such a laborious process would not be necessary, insists Hisahiko Okazaki, a former diplomat who now heads a private think-tank in Tokyo. Since the existence of Japan's Self Defence Forces is based, not on the constitution, but on any country's inherent right to self defence, all Japan needs is a prime minister determined enough to make the case that the country's security in the post-cold-war world rests not just on the narrow defence of its own territory, but also on its ability to operate collectively with America in Japan's wider security interests.
And it is not too soon to be making preparations. Leave aside any new blow-up on the Korean peninsula or a miscalculation over Taiwan, Mr Okazaki points to the imminent loss to America next year of a friendly port in Hong Kong. Along with its earlier withdrawal from Subic Bay in the Philippines, that leaves the American fleet that would respond to any new threats to vital shipping lanes in the South China Sea dependent, one way or another, on Japanese logistical support.
Without a clear effort to redefine Japan's role and allow for a greater Japanese contribution to collective security, the worry is that, come the next real military emergency, the alliance which all agree is the linchpin of security in East Asia will be tested to destruction.","EVEN as Japan 's prime minister , Ryutaro Hashimoto , was packing for this weekend 's California get - together with Bill Clinton , the turbulence that has beset Japan 's relations with America seemed to be subsiding .

1996-02-24,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224100662/fulltext/163BF71291ED4DFDPQ/43?accountid=14657,"Japan's politicians are afraid to break up NIT, the world's biggest telecoms company. Luckily, there is another way to expose it to competition
YOU might be forgiven for asking what the fuss has been about. A year ago Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) set up a committee to advise whether Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) should be broken up in the interests of competition. On two previous occasions-in 1985, when it was privatised, and in 1990 when a similar committee recommended a break-up-NTT had fought off threats to split it up. Many Japanese expected this round to be the clincher. Debate has raged in the newspapers; most of the expert reports to have been published argue in favour of dismemberment. On February 29th the committee will duly advise the government that NTT should be split into three: two local telephone companies and one longdistance one, which would be able to enter the international market, from which NTT has hitherto been excluded.
However, there is every sign that the government will shelve this proposal, just like the previous ones. It will no doubt put forward all the usual excuses: that Japan needs a flagship telecoms firm; that NTT's research and development play a crucial role in keeping Japan in the vanguard of the communications revolution; that the cost of breaking up the company would outweigh any benefits.
The government's true motive, however, will be that, with elections looming, neither the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP the biggest in the ruling coalition, nor the Social Democratic Party, the second biggest, wants to risk annoying NTT's 225,000 workers. Just what Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister and the LDP leader, thinks of the break-up can be judged by the fact that he appointed Ichiro Hino as minister of posts and telecommunications. As a previous head of the Centre for Socialist Thought, Mr Hino is not a man in whom deregulatory fervour runs deep.
For the time being, therefore, NTT will probably remain intact. How much does this matter? If you take some statistics at face value, you might conclude that Japan has little need of sharper competition in telecoms. It already possesses more than loo carriers, and foreign companies have been investing heavily. In a fit of generosity, and having indeed taken such numbers at face value, the authors of an OECD report in 1993 pronounced Japan's telecoms industry the world's most liberalised, with America and Britain a whisker behind.
The figures, however, are misleading. Since 1985 the MPT has given NTT a fairly easy time. The company has been allowed to remain in both local and long-distance businesses at a time when competitors have been restricted to one or the other. Only three rivals (DDI, Japan Telecom and Teleway), and not one of the new local companies, have so far been allowed to enter the long-distance market. The predictable result is that telephony in Japan is needlessly expensive (see table on next page). Although the cost of each local call has stayed at a manageable Y10(ten cents), the monthly rental for each line is Y1,750, and consumers have to fork out an astonishing 75,000 for each line to be connected in the first place.
Might this change even if NTT stays intact? It is possible. For some time the MPr has been denying that it ever restricted the ability of competitors to enter the long-distance market. Though this denial is nonsense (it is rejected by the Keidanren, an influential pressure group, the Fair Trade Commission and even NTT itself), it suggests that, henceforth, the ministry really will let competitors into any market they choose. At the end of January it unveiled a variety of deregulatory measures that included ""a clarification of the absence of regulations on telecommunications carriers by service classification"". In other words, it stuck to its claim that there never had been any barriers, while telling everybody that they had been removed.
In principle, opening the market to all comers in this way could have a bigger impact than would the dismembering of NTT. Those who advocate a break-up say that dismemberment would stop NTT using its long-distance calls to subsidise its local ones. But the evidence from the two countries which most people, who are not employed by the OECD, consider to be the most liberal in this domain is that the idea of splitting carriers into long-distance and local firms is becoming an anachronism.
The experience of Britain and America is that splitting up a giant matters less than introducing competition. In Britain, BT has not been split up; instead it has been held back in some markets and rivals allowed in. In America, when ""Ma Bell"" was dissolved in 1984, one result was to leave behind a string of local monopolies. Now that America is deregulating again, it has decided to let all companies (even AT&T) compete in all markets- not just local and long-distance telephony but also various forms of television and cellular services.
The trouble in Japan is that even companies that have been given the green light to compete with NTT have been put at a systematic disadvantage. NTT is the only company with the lines to Japan's 60m telephones, so any would-be local or long-distance company must, in the end, use its infrastructure. NTT has made this both difficult and expensive, forcing prospective local competitors to use its regional networks rather than its cheaper local ones. Since the cost of a local TT call is a mere Yl0, and until very recently it charged competitors 2.5 per call to connect to these regional networks, it is not surprising that NTT still has 99% of the local telephone market.
NTT's three long-distance competitors have about a third of that market, but their position is also fragile. This is because their long-distance calls must be connected at both ends by NTT lines, and paying for this eats up about half of their revenue. For its part, NTT subsidises its own long-distance operations with its local ones. Although the two aspects of its work are formally divided, many employees of NTT's nine ""local"" divisions are engaged in long-distance work, such as billing or capturing business from long-distance competitors.
What are the chances of forcing rr to compete on more equal terms? Steven Hughes, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, argues that the mere threat of a break-up has been a good way to scare the company into making life easier for its rivals. From March it will cut its longdistance rates: a three-minute call from Tokyo to Osaka will drop from Y170 to Y130; it will fall to Y100 by 2000. NTT said last September that it would open up the local network to anyone who wanted access. A month later it cut access rates for long-distance carriers from Y12.57 to Y10.46. The following month it allowed local competitors to connect to local rather than regional networks and cut the local rate to Y8.10. Although this is still probably too high to allow new entrants into the market and offer a service cheaper than its own, few believe NTT's claim that it cannot afford further reductions in the connection rate. Toru Aizeki, of the FTC, says that NTT tends to include its own marketing costs in the fee it levies from competitors using its facilities. This means, in effect, that its competitors pay for its own efforts to undermine them. But by the end of the year, says Yasuhiko Taniwaki, deputy director of the MPT, rules will be in place to make sure that NTT calculates these charges in an open and fair way. For the moment, the MPT seems serious in its intention to open the NTT network to others at realistic prices.January's clarification to allow competitors into every market creates the possibility of local, long-distance and international carriers linking up together to create a formidable rival to NTT. On February 19th it emerged that the ministry was considering allowing KDD, the formerly state-owned international carrier, to compete in the domestic markets.
Whatever the regulator may do, technology is bringing rapid change. The falling cost of cellular telephones should eventually allow rivals to bypass NTT's network altogether. Since last April, the number of users has doubled, to 8.7m. Meanwhile, the ""Personal Handyphone"", a less flexible but potentially much cheaper bit of equipment, has so far attracted only 700,000 subscribers thanks to a poor pricing policy. Now that NTT and DDI have started discounting Handyphones, demand could grow quickly. At this rate, Japan's politicians may never need to destroy their telecoms behemoth. Technology and competition may do the job for them.","Japan 's politicians are afraid to break up NIT , the world 's biggest telecoms company . Luckily , there is another way to expose it to competition 
 YOU might be forgiven for asking what the fuss has been about . A year ago Japan 's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications ( MPT ) set up a committee to advise whether Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ( NTT ) should be broken up in the interests of competition . On two previous occasions - in 1985 , when it was privatised , and in 1990 when a similar committee recommended a break - up - NTT had fought off threats to split it up . Many Japanese expected this round to be the clincher . Debate has raged in the newspapers ; most of the expert reports to have been published argue in favour of dismemberment . On February 29th the committee will duly advise the government that NTT should be split into three : two local telephone companies and one longdistance one , which would be able to enter the international market , from which NTT has hitherto been excluded . 
 However , there is every sign that the government will shelve this proposal , just like the previous ones . It will no doubt put forward all the usual excuses : that Japan needs a flagship telecoms firm ; that NTT 's research and development play a crucial role in keeping Japan in the vanguard of the communications revolution ; that the cost of breaking up the company would outweigh any benefits . 
 The government 's true motive , however , will be that , with elections looming , neither the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP the biggest in the ruling coalition , nor the Social Democratic Party , the second biggest , wants to risk annoying NTT 's 225,000 workers . Just what Ryutaro Hashimoto's , thinks of the break - up can be judged by the fact that Ryutaro Hashimoto appointed Ichiro Hino as minister of posts and telecommunications . As a previous head of the Centre for Socialist Thought , Mr Hino is not a man in whom deregulatory fervour runs deep . 
 For the time being , therefore , NTT will probably remain intact . How much does this matter ? If you take some statistics at face value , you might conclude that Japan has little need of sharper competition in telecoms . It already possesses more than loo carriers , and foreign companies have been investing heavily . In a fit of generosity , and having indeed taken such numbers at face value , the authors of an OECD report in 1993 pronounced Japan 's telecoms industry the world 's most liberalised , with America and Britain a whisker behind . 
 The figures , however , are misleading . Since 1985 the MPT has given NTT a fairly easy time . The company has been allowed to remain in both local and long - distance businesses at a time when competitors have been restricted to one or the other . Only three rivals ( DDI , Japan Telecom and Teleway ) , and not one of the new local companies , have so far been allowed to enter the long - distance market . The predictable result is that telephony in Japan is needlessly expensive ( see table on next page ) . Although the cost of each local call has stayed at a manageable Y10(ten cents ) , the monthly rental for each line is Y1,750 , and consumers have to fork out an astonishing 75,000 for each line to be connected in the first place . 
 Might this change even if NTT stays intact ? It is possible . For some time the MPr has been denying that it ever restricted the ability of competitors to enter the long - distance market . Though this denial is nonsense ( it is rejected by the Keidanren , an influential pressure group , the Fair Trade Commission and even NTT itself ) , it suggests that , henceforth , the ministry really will let competitors into any market they choose . At the end of January it unveiled a variety of deregulatory measures that included "" a clarification of the absence of regulations on telecommunications carriers by service classification "" . In other words , it stuck to its claim that there never had been any barriers , while telling everybody that they had been removed . 
 In principle , opening the market to all comers in this way could have a bigger impact than would the dismembering of NTT . Those who advocate a break - up say that dismemberment would stop NTT using its long - distance calls to subsidise its local ones . But the evidence from the two countries which most people , who are not employed by the OECD , consider to be the most liberal in this domain is that the idea of splitting carriers into long - distance and local firms is becoming an anachronism . 
 The experience of Britain and America is that splitting up a giant matters less than introducing competition . In Britain , BT has not been split up ; instead it has been held back in some markets and rivals allowed in . In America , when "" Ma Bell "" was dissolved in 1984 , one result was to leave behind a string of local monopolies . Now that America is deregulating again , it has decided to let all companies ( even AT&T ) compete in all markets- not just local and long - distance telephony but also various forms of television and cellular services . 
 The trouble in Japan is that even companies that have been given the green light to compete with NTT have been put at a systematic disadvantage . NTT is the only company with the lines to Japan 's 60 m telephones , so any would - be local or long - distance company must , in the end , use its infrastructure . NTT has made this both difficult and expensive , forcing prospective local competitors to use its regional networks rather than its cheaper local ones . Since the cost of a local TT call is a mere Yl0 , and until very recently it charged competitors 2.5 per call to connect to these regional networks , it is not surprising that NTT still has 99 % of the local telephone market . 
 NTT 's three long - distance competitors have about a third of that market , but their position is also fragile . This is because their long - distance calls must be connected at both ends by NTT lines , and paying for this eats up about half of their revenue . For its part , NTT subsidises its own long - distance operations with its local ones . Although the two aspects of its work are formally divided , many employees of NTT 's nine "" local "" divisions are engaged in long - distance work , such as billing or capturing business from long - distance competitors .

IT WAS just an hour-long chat, a chance to get acquainted. Nonetheless, Bill Clinton's meeting with Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's pugnacious new prime minister, in Santa Monica on February 23rd is being hailed as a stride in the right direction. Mr Clinton referred to the Japanese leader as ""Roo""; Mr Hashimoto called the American president ""Biru"". This kind-of-first-name relationship, it is assumed, will be useful in the tricky negotiations that face the two countries. It is nice to be able to pick up the telephone and have an impromptu conversation (via the interpreters).
Mr Clinton is due to make a state visit to Japan on April 16th. The trip was originally scheduled for last November, but was postponed when the showdown with Congress over the budget kept the president tied to his desk. Feelings then were running high in Japan about the rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl in Okinawa by three American servicemen. The new Japanese leader, it is said, feels he has to do something about the 47,000 troops the United States keeps stationed on Japanese territory.
That is one issue. The other is the fact that a perceived failure by the White House to get the Japanese to do more to open their markets to American goods will play dangerously into the hands of Pat Buchanan and his protectionist ""America First"" campaign. Mr Buchanan says he would ""unilaterally end"" Japan's trade surplus by slapping a 10% tariff on Japanese exports to the United States.
Mr Clinton used his trip t California last week to attack Mr Buchanan's trade policies and trumpet his own successes. The White House boasts that it has concluded 20 trade agreements with the Japanese government over the past three years, and that exports to Japan are up by 80% in the areas covered by these deals. As a result, 167,000 more Americans are at work today, claims Mr Clinton. Japan's trade surplus with America dropped 51% last year and is currently at its lowest level in many years.
But the Santa Monica meeting between the two leaders left several arguments unsettled, not least those about semiconductors, photographic materials, civil aviation and insurance. Both sides are anxious about the controversial 1986 semiconductor agreement, which is due to expire on July 31st. Mr Clinton is keen to renew the accord that reserves 20% of the Japanese semiconductor market for imports. Mr Hashimoto is equally adamant (at least in public) about ending the agreement
Since both men are worried about elections (Mr Hashimoto, despite having only recently got the job, must face the voters some time in the next 18 months), the semiconductors battle threatens to be as bloody as last June's dispute over car exports. When he was trade and industry minister in the previous government, Mr Hashimoto won widespread support within Japan (and, indeed, won his current job) for angrily facing down Mickey Kantor, the American trade representative, during heated discussions over opening the Japanese market to American cars, lorries and parts. Negotiations over access to Japan's insurance, aviation and photographic markets promise to be no less bitter.
In the end, though, Mr Hashimoto, one of the toughest men in Japanese politics, may quietly give Mr Clinton enough of a trade success to undermine Mr Buchanan and other protectionists-with benchmarks to be monitored by trade officials from both sides-if in return he can noisily win some concessions from America over the Okinawa bases.
In order to calm the anti-American anger caused by last September's rape, officials from the two countries have been examining ways to reduce America's quasicolonial presence on Okinawa. The Pentagon tends to see its 42 military installations on Japan's most southerly island as sacrosanct. But the mood elsewhere in Washington is moving towards a willingness to close several of the 42-including Camp Hansen, home of the three Americans involved in the rape--if this goes hand in hand with a broad-ranging agreement on trade. If some of the Americans departing from Okinawa can move to bases on the Japanese mainland, so much the better.
The Japanese have their own interest in a deal. Mr Hashimoto and his colleagues do not believe that Mr Buchanan is likely to get elected. But they do worry that his protectionist views will take root among Americans at large (and, indeed, some would argue that they already have). To guard against that, the best thing Mr Hashimoto can do is probably to reaffirm his wavering commitment to the deregulation of Japan's markets.","SANTA MONICA , CALIFORNIA

IN SPORT, teams usually sack the coach only when they are on a losing streak. So it is with the Japanese economy. When the yen soared and the economy dived at the start of last year, the press was clamouring for deregulation and for the economy to be taken out of bureaucratic hands.
Since last April, the yen has dropped by 22%, interest rates have been slashed to virtually nothing and the government appears to have pumped almost 9 trillion ($86 billion) into the economy in two packages, the biggest of which was last September. So it should come as no great surprise that the economy is showing some signs of life, and that the clamour for change has died down.
Consumer spending has been inching up since last summer. Industrial production increased by 0.5% in January, growing for the fourth month in a row. Japan's Economic Planning Agency estimates that growth this year will be 2.5% and for once (it has been estimating at least that for the previous four years), private-sector economists do not regard this prediction as hopelessly optimistic.
Last year, when things looked bleak, the talk was all of reinventing the Japanese economic model; of letting markets rather than bureaucrats set prices; of slashing the red tape that enfolds the economy. Now that things are picking up, the downside of deregulation is being stressed. The trouble is that doing something about red tape, according to Nobuya Nemoto, an economist at the Nomura Research Institute, may, in the short run, produce an almighty jolt to the economy. Although foreign competition and more imports will increase productivity eventually, the immediate effect may well be more unemployment.
This has not been lost on Ryutaro Hashimoto, the new prime minister. Already unpopular, the last thing he needs is more people out of work. Unemployment, officially 3.4%, is at a record high, and elections are no more than a year and a half away. Hence the government has, at best, been lukewarm on reform. It has sat on a proposal to lift the ban on holding companies. It may do the same to a proposal to break up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's telecommunications giant. And there is even some discussion of reversing the decision to introduce a firstpast-the-post electoral system.
Yet this timidity is unwise. The present recovery has required huge injections of taxpayers' cash to get things moving. Many economists think that the effects of this will peter out by the middle of the year. Without another fix, the economy will relapse into its previous torpid state. Some even think that the Japanese economy is on the verge of another recession. Yet public debt is rising so fast (see page 71) that the government cannot afford to carry on splurging on the economy.
As the economy falters, so unemployment will pick up again. Basking in the faint glow of an apparent economic. recovery might be the easy option, but it is not the right one.","TOKYO

In this article, he explains why he finds the prospect exhilarating
NATIONS are nurtured by myths.Japan is no exception. If I mention the ""third opening of Japan"", most Japanese will immediately know what I mean,just as if I were citing the need for a new Magna Carta. Unless outsiders place what is happening in Japan today in the context of our history and our myths, they will find it difficult to understand the particular turningpoint we are facing in our long evolution as a nation.
Our myths arise from the fact that we are a group of narrow islands off the coast of Asia, coming only sporadically into contact with our continental neighbours down through the years. We take comfort in our homogeneity, in our capacity to absorb influences from the mainland at our own pace, in timespans measured by centuries rather than decades. For us, much more than for Britain, ""the jungle begins at Calais""-in our case, the Korea Strait. In essence, we see ourselves as a cosy village society where consensus is the norm and where we all live by unspoken rules to make life tolerable in a green but crowded land with few natural resources.
The first great challenge to these myths came in 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry and his heavily armed ""black ships"" dropped anchor in Tokyo (then known as Edo) Bay, and sent a message from President Millard Fillmore demanding that Japan open its doors to trade with the world. Until then, the Tokugawa Shoguns who had ruled Japan since 1603 had imposed a near-total ban on travel into or out of the country, the single exception being the port of Nagasaki, in southern Japan, where Dutch and Chinese merchants were allowed to bring in their wares.
The Shogunate officials knew that their antiquated shore batteries were no match for Perry's cannons. They had no recourse but to give way, choosing to do so as little as they could. In so doing, they set in motion a nationwide debate between advocates of continued isolation and reformers who wanted to open up the country. The debate lasted 15 years a period of great turmoil, ending only with the collapse of the Shogunate, the abolition of feudalism, and the establishment of a reform-minded central government under the direct rule of the Emperor Meiji. This series of events is known today as the first opening of Japan.
The Meiji era, which lasted for nearly half a century, was a heady time for Japan. The young reformers gathered around the emperor knew that for Japan's survival, they had to make drastic changes in the political, economic and social institutions of their country. One of the five pledges with which Meiji inaugurated his reign was to ""seek knowledge throughout the world"". His reformers created a modern army and navy, introduced capitalism, universal education, and a limited form of constitutional democracy, including the concept of equality under the law.
But the grafting of Western institutions and values on to traditional patterns of Japanese thought and behaviour was not achieved without great strain. The Meiji reformers were mostly bureaucrats and administrators, and, although they saw the need for elected parliaments, they preferred Bismarck to Gladstone-that is, they limited both the powers of parliament and the numbers of those able to vote for it. It was not until the early 1920s that Takashi Hara, the first commoner to become prime minister, introduced universal adult male suffrage. His reward was assassination. From the late 1920s, Japan became increasingly militaristic and authoritarian, embarking on adventures in China which led to confrontation with the United States and Britain and ended in disastrous defeat in the second world war.
Japan's surrender in 1945 and the sweeping reforms brought about during a six-year occupation by American forces under the command of General Douglas MacArthur constitute what many of us call the second opening of Japan. The second opening, like the first, began as a result of conflict with foreigners but continued differently because most of the changes took place under foreign duress. Yet the main planks of the occupation reforms embodied ideas and programmes begun in the Meiji period and were genuinely popular with voters: land reform, dissolution of the zaibatsu (giant financial and industrial trusts) freedom of speech and assembly, free trade unions and women's suffrage. A new constitution was drafted, including the famous article nine renouncing the right to go to war and banning the use of armed force. At least in form,Japan became a fully-fledged parliamentary democracy, with political power in the hands of the people's elected representatives.
Under the impetus of these reforms, and helped by the cold war which kept Japan firmly within America's orbit and under the protection of the us Japan security treaty, our people concentrated singlemindedly on economic recovery and growth. With no natural resources to speak of beyond the education and talents of our citizens, we imported raw materials from all over the world and exported manufactured goods to all the world. By the late 1960s we had outstripped West Germany as the non-communist world's second largest economy, surpassed in size only by the United States.
Our political progress, however, did not keep pace with the explosive growth of our economy. Conservative political forces quickly came together to form the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP But the opposition Socialists remained ideologically stuck in the rhetoric of the cold war, advocating the dissolution of the alliance with the United States and an unarmed neutrality that could only benefit the Soviet Union. Voters used the Socialists and other opposition parties to express dissatisfaction with the government of the day, but never in such numbers as to deprive the LDP of power. While we remained a parliamentary democracy in form, in practice the LDP was continuously in office, except for a brief period in 1947-48.
That long hold on power bred corruption, enhanced by the cosy village nature of Japanese society. Meanwhile, from outside Japan, and particularly from America and Europe, we began to hear increasingly shrill demands to open up our markets; outsiders also urged us to assume a diplomatic role in the international community commensurate with the size of our economy and its weight in the world.
The new frontier
To my mind, what these pressures building up inside and outside our country amount to is nothing less than a demand for the third opening of Japan-for changes as drastic and far-reaching as the ones brought about by the Meiji reformers and by the American occupation after 1945. That, indeed, is what my party, the New Frontier Party, stands for. If our programme succeeds, we will have brought about a revolution that will complete the work begun by the Meiji reformers more than 100 years ago. It will embody the most far-reaching changes that our country has ever known, and enable us to join the ranks of what I call the world's normal democratic states.
We have in Japan today the institutional forms of parliamentary government, but with a content rather different from what is regarded as normal in American or European democracies. Ours still reflects consensus politics and an isolationist mentality that excludes outsiders. The goal of the New Frontier Party is to break this mould and to bring about alternation in government between two political parties that will compete with each other on the basis of policy, not of factions or of personalities.
The Liberal Democrats' post-war monopoly of power was broken in July 1993, when Tsutomu Hata and I led a group of reform-minded colleagues to rebel against the party leadership and to establish a new party, the Japan Renewal Party. Together with other opposition parties, we won the general election that month and formed the Hosokawa coalition government. The following year, the Liberal Democrats made a deal with their sworn enemies, the Socialists, and returned to power. In reaction to this unholy alliance, all the main opposition parties except the Communists came together in December 1994 to establish the New Frontier Party.
Today, at least in form, we have the beginnings of a two-party system. On one side stands the government-a coalition of the LDP, the Socialists and the Sakigake or Harbingers, a minor party. The coalition was headed first by a Socialist, Tomchi Murayama, and now by a Liberal Democrat, Ryutaro Hashimoto. Despite their differences in ideological outlook, the LDP and the Socialists are essentially status quo parties. They mouth the slogans of reform, but in fact they want to keep their vested interests.
The new agenda
By contrast, our party is dedicated to the cause of reform. We call for thoroughgoing changes in politics, in the economy, in education and in society. In politics, we have been partially successful in that, during our brief year in power, we changed the election system from one of multi-seat districts to one which has 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats to be voted for on a proportional-representation list. It is somewhat like the German system. Each voter will have two votes and can cast his ballot both for his local candidate and for the party of his choice.
The world has not yet recognised the revolutionary nature of this change because the first election under the new system has yet to be held. At the latest, however, the next general election must be held in July 1997. It could come much soonerpossibly this summer or autumn. It may not immediately bring about a permanent two-party system but, as voters become used to the system, minor parties will fade away. The Socialist Party, recently renamed the Social Democratic Party, will be the top candidate for extinction.
 In each of the 300 single-seat constituencies, voters will have two clear points of view to choose betweenthat of the ruling coalition and that of the New Frontier Party. Many legislators, even those belonging to our party, are uncomfortable with this prospect. They want to build coalitions based on interests and personalities, as they have been doing till now, and are not sure that voters will respond to policybased appeals. I am convinced, however, that the New Frontier Party must make this sort of appeal to the voters.
Lessons from Iwate
My own constituency in Iwate is largely rural but I have insisted that farmers, like other citizens, must face the fact of international competition and not simply hide behind protective barriers. My recipe for change brings pain to my constituents but so far I have managed to be reelected with substantial majorities. I feel certain that, nationwide, voters will respond to political leadership if that leadership can provide a clear, compelling vision of the future and realistic steps to achieve it.
For us, there is no alternative to the third opening of Japan-to opening our markets wide to the international community, to chopping down the thicket of rules and regulations which are choking initiative, creativity and economic growth. I have no illusions about the difficulty of our task. Japan has been a regulated society for more than 1,000 years. We have a lot of people, little land, and few natural resources. For everyone to share in an economy of scarcity, there have to be regulations, and on the whole people have accepted these regulations. In modern times, the concept of fairness, of equality, has taken precedence over the concept of individual freedom. We are a society without vast gaps between rich and poor, management and workers. We would like to keep it so, but not at the cost of stifling personal freedom and individual initiative.
Despite my experience with voters in Iwate, I know that most Japanese still feel uncomfortable and disoriented by the prospect of living in a society with few regulations and where each person will have to be more self reliant and take greater responsibility for his or her own actions. Nevertheless there is no other way for Japan to move into the 21St century and survive. What we are embarked upon is a revolutionary process, and it will not be completed in a day.
We want lean government at the centre, and more power devolved to local entities. At the moment, Japan has a highly centralised system with no clear division between the central and local governments. Ultimately we will have about 300 local authorities nationwide small enough to be close to the voters, large enough to carry out effective government-to replace the present hodgepodge of prefectures, cities, towns and villages.
Educational reform may be the most important of the reforms we propose. Universal education was one of the great achievements of the Meiji reformers. Japan today is one of the world's most literate nations. But our education system remains stuck in the i9th century, emphasising rote learning and stuffing students with all sorts of relevant and irrelevant information. We need education that will foster self reliance and creativity. Group values like fairness and equality are important, but the primary emphasis must be on allowing the individual to develop. Education is an area in which we may not see results for ten years or more. But we must begin now, for we are already far behind the leaders in this field.
Japan and the world
Internationally, I have long advocated a much more active and participatory stance in world affairs, with the proviso that we remain in close partnership with the United States.
Some Japanese argue that, with the cold war over and with America no longer as overwhelming a military and economic superpower as it used to be, we should form closer ties with Asia, perhaps even play the role of honest broker between China and the United States. I disagree. I hope that China, as its economy grows and its people prosper, will successfully make the transition from authoritarianism to democratic government. I also hope that China and Taiwan will settle their differences peacefully on the basis of their common recognition that Taiwan is part of China. But these are not yet foregone conclusions. North Korea is an even more troubling neighbour than China. Asia needs the American security presence, and the us-Japan security treaty provides the means for America not only to protect Japan but to remain involved with Asia. Furthermore, Japan's own past record in Asia is not forgotten. We will be accepted and considered non-threatening by our Asian neighbours only to the extent that we retain a strong security relationship and economic partnership with the United States.
This does not mean that we will agree with America in all respects nor that we will fail to advance our own point of view. We may have as many disagreements with America as do Britain, France or Germany. But like them, our disagreements should always take place within the context of our basic alliance. Alliance with America is as essential for Japan as it is for Europe-perhaps more so, because in Asia we have nothing like NATO or the European Union.
 We want a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and pledge to play a leading role in the affairs of that body. The United Nations is far from perfect, but it is the only international forum we have, and we want to make it better. How can we do so unless we participate in all its activities, including peacekeeping? I have proposed that Japan establish a standby force, separate from the present Self Defence Force, that will be available for UN peacekeeping duties whenever called upon by the Security Council and the secretary general.
Our constitution forbids going to war as a sovereign right of the Japanese government, but I submit that it by no means forbids Japan from placing its forces under UN command for peacekeeping duties. In fact, the preamble of the constitution talks of preserving ""our security and existence, trusting in the justice and faith of the peaceloving peoples of the world."" How can we do so, how can we ""occupy an honoured place in an international society striving for the preservation of peace, and the banishment of tyranny and slavery, oppression and intolerance,"" if we do not participate fully in UN peacekeeping?
Ultimately, the idea that underlies the third opening of Japan is the need to change society. We have to move from decisions by consensus, so called, into the essence of democracy, decision-making by the majority, with the minority accepting those decisions in the belief that today's minority will become tomorrow's majority. Our new election system is one means to this end, but I am under no illusions that we can reach our goal without repeated setbacks. Still, the 21st century is less than four years away, and it is urgent not only to get the process started but to make sure that it becomes irreversible.","Ichiro Ozawa believes that Japan, for the third time in little over a century, needs radical reform. In this article, he explains why he finds the prospect exhilarating
NATIONS are nurtured by myths.Japan is no exception. If I mention the ""third opening of Japan"", most Japanese will immediately know what I mean,just as if I were citing the need for a new Magna Carta. Unless outsiders place what is happening in Japan today in the context of our history and our myths, they will find it difficult to understand the particular turningpoint we are facing in our long evolution as a nation.
Our myths arise from the fact that we are a group of narrow islands off the coast of Asia, coming only sporadically into contact with our continental neighbours down through the years. We take comfort in our homogeneity, in our capacity to absorb influences from the mainland at our own pace, in timespans measured by centuries rather than decades. For us, much more than for Britain, ""the jungle begins at Calais""-in our case, the Korea Strait. In essence, we see ourselves as a cosy village society where consensus is the norm and where we all live by unspoken rules to make life tolerable in a green but crowded land with few natural resources.
The first great challenge to these myths came in 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry and his heavily armed ""black ships"" dropped anchor in Tokyo (then known as Edo) Bay, and sent a message from President Millard Fillmore demanding that Japan open its doors to trade with the world. Until then, the Tokugawa Shoguns who had ruled Japan since 1603 had imposed a near-total ban on travel into or out of the country, the single exception being the port of Nagasaki, in southern Japan, where Dutch and Chinese merchants were allowed to bring in their wares.
The Shogunate officials knew that their antiquated shore batteries were no match for Perry's cannons. They had no recourse but to give way, choosing to do so as little as they could. In so doing, they set in motion a nationwide debate between advocates of continued isolation and reformers who wanted to open up the country. The debate lasted 15 years a period of great turmoil, ending only with the collapse of the Shogunate, the abolition of feudalism, and the establishment of a reform-minded central government under the direct rule of the Emperor Meiji. This series of events is known today as the first opening of Japan.
The Meiji era, which lasted for nearly half a century, was a heady time for Japan. The young reformers gathered around the emperor knew that for Japan's survival, they had to make drastic changes in the political, economic and social institutions of their country. One of the five pledges with which Meiji inaugurated his reign was to ""seek knowledge throughout the world"". His reformers created a modern army and navy, introduced capitalism, universal education, and a limited form of constitutional democracy, including the concept of equality under the law.
But the grafting of Western institutions and values on to traditional patterns of Japanese thought and behaviour was not achieved without great strain. The Meiji reformers were mostly bureaucrats and administrators, and, although they saw the need for elected parliaments, they preferred Bismarck to Gladstone-that is, they limited both the powers of parliament and the numbers of those able to vote for it. It was not until the early 1920s that Takashi Hara, the first commoner to become prime minister, introduced universal adult male suffrage. His reward was assassination. From the late 1920s, Japan became increasingly militaristic and authoritarian, embarking on adventures in China which led to confrontation with the United States and Britain and ended in disastrous defeat in the second world war.
Japan's surrender in 1945 and the sweeping reforms brought about during a six-year occupation by American forces under the command of General Douglas MacArthur constitute what many of us call the second opening of Japan. The second opening, like the first, began as a result of conflict with foreigners but continued differently because most of the changes took place under foreign duress. Yet the main planks of the occupation reforms embodied ideas and programmes begun in the Meiji period and were genuinely popular with voters: land reform, dissolution of the zaibatsu (giant financial and industrial trusts) freedom of speech and assembly, free trade unions and women's suffrage. A new constitution was drafted, including the famous article nine renouncing the right to go to war and banning the use of armed force. At least in form,Japan became a fully-fledged parliamentary democracy, with political power in the hands of the people's elected representatives.
Under the impetus of these reforms, and helped by the cold war which kept Japan firmly within America's orbit and under the protection of the us Japan security treaty, our people concentrated singlemindedly on economic recovery and growth. With no natural resources to speak of beyond the education and talents of our citizens, we imported raw materials from all over the world and exported manufactured goods to all the world. By the late 1960s we had outstripped West Germany as the non-communist world's second largest economy, surpassed in size only by the United States.
Our political progress, however, did not keep pace with the explosive growth of our economy. Conservative political forces quickly came together to form the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP But the opposition Socialists remained ideologically stuck in the rhetoric of the cold war, advocating the dissolution of the alliance with the United States and an unarmed neutrality that could only benefit the Soviet Union. Voters used the Socialists and other opposition parties to express dissatisfaction with the government of the day, but never in such numbers as to deprive the LDP of power. While we remained a parliamentary democracy in form, in practice the LDP was continuously in office, except for a brief period in 1947-48.
That long hold on power bred corruption, enhanced by the cosy village nature of Japanese society. Meanwhile, from outside Japan, and particularly from America and Europe, we began to hear increasingly shrill demands to open up our markets; outsiders also urged us to assume a diplomatic role in the international community commensurate with the size of our economy and its weight in the world.
The new frontier
To my mind, what these pressures building up inside and outside our country amount to is nothing less than a demand for the third opening of Japan-for changes as drastic and far-reaching as the ones brought about by the Meiji reformers and by the American occupation after 1945. That, indeed, is what my party, the New Frontier Party, stands for. If our programme succeeds, we will have brought about a revolution that will complete the work begun by the Meiji reformers more than 100 years ago. It will embody the most far-reaching changes that our country has ever known, and enable us to join the ranks of what I call the world's normal democratic states.
We have in Japan today the institutional forms of parliamentary government, but with a content rather different from what is regarded as normal in American or European democracies. Ours still reflects consensus politics and an isolationist mentality that excludes outsiders. The goal of the New Frontier Party is to break this mould and to bring about alternation in government between two political parties that will compete with each other on the basis of policy, not of factions or of personalities.
The Liberal Democrats' post-war monopoly of power was broken in July 1993, when Tsutomu Hata and I led a group of reform-minded colleagues to rebel against the party leadership and to establish a new party, the Japan Renewal Party. Together with other opposition parties, we won the general election that month and formed the Hosokawa coalition government. The following year, the Liberal Democrats made a deal with their sworn enemies, the Socialists, and returned to power. In reaction to this unholy alliance, all the main opposition parties except the Communists came together in December 1994 to establish the New Frontier Party.
Today, at least in form, we have the beginnings of a two-party system. On one side stands the government-a coalition of the LDP, the Socialists and the Sakigake or Harbingers, a minor party. The coalition was headed first by a Socialist, Tomchi Murayama, and now by a Liberal Democrat, Ryutaro Hashimoto. Despite their differences in ideological outlook, the LDP and the Socialists are essentially status quo parties. They mouth the slogans of reform, but in fact they want to keep their vested interests.
The new agenda
By contrast, our party is dedicated to the cause of reform. We call for thoroughgoing changes in politics, in the economy, in education and in society. In politics, we have been partially successful in that, during our brief year in power, we changed the election system from one of multi-seat districts to one which has 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats to be voted for on a proportional-representation list.

It would have taken a disaster of momentous proportions for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to lose the upper-house by-election in Gifu prefecture on March 24th. In the event, Tsuyako Ono, the 62-year-old widow of an LDP member who died in office, won a nifty 50.5% of the vote. Neither of the opposition candidates came close: the New Frontier Party's Tetsuo Yoshioka picked up only 28.9% and the Communist Party's Hiroyuki Yamamoto 20.6%.
Ichiro Ozawa, the boss of the New Frontier Party (NFP), had hoped to turn the Gifu by-election into a referendum on the government's bungling of the jusen affair. Members of Mr Ozawa's party have spent the past three weeks blockading a committee room in the Diet (parliament) to prevent any debate taking place on the coming year's Y75.1 trillion ($705 billion) budgetwith Y685 billion allocated to wind up the seven all-but-bankrupt mortgage companies known as jusen (see page 70).
The N FP'S crushing defeat in Gifu put an end to its sit-in. Although 6o% of voters polled in the mountain prefecture were dead set against the use of public money in the jusen affair, they were clearly more annoyed with the opposition for its childish efforts to delay the budget and jeopardise the economy's fragile recovery.
The face-saving formula that the LDP and its two smaller coalition partners (the Social Democratic Party of Japan and the New Sakigake Party) offered Mr Ozawa and his weary troops includes a promise not to use their majority in the more important lower house to ram the budget through. The ruling party pledged instead merely to give ""sincere"" consideration to the opposition's demands not to use public money to help wind up the jusen, The LDP also agreed to consider questioning ""those involved"" in a donation to Koichi Kato, the LDP's secretary-general, from a now defunct company that borrowed heavily from a jusen.
With the opposition in attendance, the government has now passed al bills that had to clear the Diet before the end of the fiscal year on March 31st. It has also passed a stopgap budget of 11.6 trillion-enough to pay the bills until May 2oth. So what have Mr Ozawa and the NFP actually achieved with their barricade? Very little.
Some believe that, by threatening to nobble Mr Kato, the NFP has made an early election more likely. Mr Ozawa wants to strike while the government's popularity is plummeting (down to 35% from 60% in January) as a result of its decision to bail out the speculators behind the jusen fiasco. Mr Kato has been singled out for a mugging.
As the day-to-day manager of the LDP, Mr Kato has been working hard to keep the coalition intact and is determined to avoid an early general election (due by the summer of 1997). He hopes to see the jusen affair disposed of, and forgotten, first. By demanding that Mr Kato be called to give evidence before the Diet for allegedly receiving an illicit donation of Y10m, the NFP had been hoping to tie him down for a while. But it is unlikely that the ruling party's bosses will get round to putting Mr Kato on the stand.
Others say that a resurgent LDP, buoyed by its success in Gifu, must now be thinking about an early election anyway. The LDP still has enormous support in the countryside. But the party would be stupid (which the LDP most certainly is not) to draw any broad conclusions from the by-election.

With the budget all but out of the way, Mr Hashimoto has some breathing-space to resolve the jusen problem. A compromise is on the cards.

It would have taken a disaster of momentous proportions for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) to lose the upper - house by - election in Gifu prefecture on March 24th . In the event , Tsuyako Ono , the 62 - year - old widow of an LDP member who died in office , won a nifty 50.5 % of the vote . Neither of the opposition candidates came close : the New Frontier Party 's Tetsuo Yoshioka picked up only 28.9 % and the Communist Party 's Hiroyuki Yamamoto 20.6 % . 
 Ichiro Ozawa , the boss of the New Frontier Party ( NFP ) , had hoped to turn the Gifu by - election into a referendum on Ryutaro Hashimoto's bungling of the jusen affair . Members of Mr Ozawa 's party have spent the past three weeks blockading a committee room in the Diet ( parliament ) to prevent any debate taking place on the coming year 's Y75.1 trillion ( $ 705 billion ) budgetwith Y685 billion allocated to wind up the seven all - but - bankrupt mortgage companies known as jusen ( see page 70 ) .

On March 29th, after seven years of struggle, a group of Japanese haemophiliacs infected with the HIV virus, as a result of using contaminated clotting agents, finally won their court battle against five drug companies that had supplied the products and the government that had failed to stop them. They came away with an apology, Y45m ($420,000) each and the promise of a bit more money every month to cover medical expenses. But none of this can be much consolation for the 1,800 haemophiliacs that contracted HIV, about half of all hemophiliacs in Japan, still less to the 400 that have died from AIDS.
The scandal speaks volumes about the refusal of Japan's It illustrates to admit the a nasty foreign disease such as AIDS could af- fect Japanese. It illustrates the unhealthily close connections between doctors, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the drug companies that they were supposed to be regulating.
In March 1983, America's Centers for Disease Control announced that HIV seemed to have been transmitted to haemophiliacs through unheated (ie, unsterilised) clotting agents, which were made from blood collected from donors. But not until July 1985 did the Japanese authorise heat-treated blood products. Even then, it did not order drug manufacturers to pull unheated products from the market. Both the drug companies and the ministry claimed that there was no significant risk of catching HIV from untreated products. Since then, the ministry's bureaucrats have consistently denied that they had done anything wrong. Their excuse: they did not know about the risks.
It turns out they were lying. In January, the new health minister, Naoto Kan, set up an investigation. Nine files showing that the ministry had recognised the risks-but had refused to do anything about themwere found. In July 1983, for example, a health ministry committee had even considered making emergency imports of heattreated products, but decided not to.
Yet in September 1984, Takeshi Abe, the head of Japan's AIDs research panel, found that almost half of his 48 haemophiliac patients had HIV. Three months later, the ministry found that many haemophiliacs that had been tested had HIV. Neither Mr Abe nor the ministry made these results public.
The reason seems to be that, as with other ministries, the health bureaucrats were too close to those they were supposed to be regulating. On retirement, there were plum jobs to be landed with drug firms: five senior executives at Green Cross-one of the companies involved in the casewere former ministry officials. And at that time, heated blood products were available only from foreign suppliers.
Humanitarian and health considerations seem to have played no more than a minor role. In Japan, doctors make most of their money by prescribing drugs. They stood to make more money from prescribing unheated products-which they could buy cheaply-than from expensive imported ones. Since the government fixes the price at which doctors can sell drugs, there is an incentive for the doctors to cuddle up to local drugs companies in order to get their wares more cheaply
This is not the first time that Japan has had a catastrophe of this sort. In 1979, a little known health and welfare minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, apologised to victims of a drug called quinoform, which had caused severe disabilities in 400 people. He promised to try to prevent the recur rence of such catastrophes. Mr Hashimoto is now prime minister. He has an opportunity to honour his promise.","IT WAS a comfortless victory .

IN EUROPE, the end of the cold war strained the North Atlantic alliance; but NATO is not in danger of collapse. In the Pacific, the American-Japanese alliance is also showing strain; and it seems natural to suppose that this partnership, too, will nonetheless survive. If NATO has weathered the bickering over Bosnia, the arguments over enlargement, and the ebbing of the Russian threat, then surely the AmericanJapanese alliance can overcome apparently equivalent obstacles. All it will take is a bit of statesmanship on both sides: a resolution to refrain from calling the other nasty names and a feel-good summit.
That will be Bill Clinton's hope as he sets off next week to visit Japan and South Korea. Having infuriated the Japanese by cancelling a trip to Osaka last November, Mr Clinton plans to be in Japan from April 16th to 18th, a longish trip by his standards. Unlike previous summits, which focused on trade, this one will dwell on security. It will try to stiffen Japan's willingness to play host to 47,ooo American troops, which has been wavering since three American servicemen raped a Japanese schoolgirl last September. Protestors calling for the Americans to withdraw mustered Japan's biggest demonstration in a quarter of a century.
To placate the Japanese, Mr Clinton will probably announce the return of some land now used by American troops. He will be the guest of the emperor, whose father the Americans nearly hanged after 1945: the perfect symbol of reconciliation. He will shake hands with Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who only a year ago was hurling abuse at American trade negotiators. And, with stage-managed amity, he will emphasise the importance of the two countries' alliance to East Asia's security at a time of growing regional instability-witness China's bullying of Taiwan, or North Korea's recent renunciation of the armistice that ended the Korean war.
Can the partnership be patched up in this way? There are two broad reasons for supposing that it cannot, and that the comforting analogy with NATO promotes complacency. The first doubt holds that trade arguments will soon dominate the partnership again, and that the healing effect of next week's summit will therefore be fleeting. The second maintains that the alliance is doomed by forces that no summit can address: that America is gradually losing its appetite for defending allies rich enough to defend themselves, and that rich Japan is losing patience with American tutelage.
Either of these arguments, if true, could consign the alliance to gradual decay, with potentially dreadful consequences. Deprived of America's nuclear shield, Japan would develop its own nuclear weapons to stay even with China. South Korea, which has been invaded by both Japan and China in the past, would shortly follow. So might the more sophisticated South-East Asian states, whose military budgets are already growing rapidly. Pretty soon, the whole region could be nuclear and nervous.
Such an arms race would unfold on a continent far less stable than Europe at the height of the cold war. China faces a succession struggle; North Korea faces famine and possible collapse; South Korean democracy is in a tempestuous infancy. Farther south, Indonesia has succession worries of its own; Hong Kong will revert to China next year; and Taiwan is trying to stave off a similar fate. In short, if the American-Japanese alliance frays, the miracle economies of the Pacific rim could set a second record for mankind. Having pulled off history's fastest ever advance in human welfare, they could next succumb to its fastest and nastiest reversal.
Trade troubles
How real are these dangers? Consider, first the possibility that trade rows will undermine America's partnership with Japan. Such disputes have dogged the alliance for many years, and the partnership has survived. In 1992, for instance, George Bush went to Tokyo brandishing a list of trade demands, flanked by industrialists demanding better access to Japanese markets. But the trade disputes seem to be getting worse-and have begun to jeopardise the security part of the partnership.
Mr Clinton came to power promising to redouble the commercial bias. Visiting Tokyo for the G7 summit in 1993, he turned his meeting with Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister of the time, into a trade negotiation. The defence treaty barely got a mention.
The Clinton team argued that, with the cold war at an end, geo-politics could give way to geo-economics. Communism had collapsed; or, where it had not, communists were too intent on getting rich to threaten anybody. In the absence of this threat, America could withdraw from the costly, tiring business of propping up allies and staring down foes. Instead, it should concentrate on economic goals, chiefly export promotion. If the pursuit of economic gain hurt cold-war ties, then so be it.
This thinking changed American policy. The Commerce Department saw its budget and prestige expand; the State Department grew demoralised. The biggest impact from this shift fell on America's dealings with Japan. Here was a country whose security role now seemed less crucial. And here was a country whose vast markets appeared closed to American products.With his trip to Tokyo in 1993, Mr Clinton inaugurated a policy of aggressive trade demands, untrammelled by concern for the wider partnership.
Three years later, Japan-bashing on trade has damaged relations between the two countries. An opinion poll taken in the middle of last year's acrimonious car talks found that friendly feelings between the two countries had hit a ten-year low. Japans trade minister of the time grew wildly popular by denouncing American demands; so popular, indeed, that he is now prime minister. Meanwhile, thuggish China and North Korea have demonstrated that the security alliance with Japan is as necessary as ever.
In 1995 Joseph Nye, a senior DefenceDepartment official, declared that the military alliance was suffering from neglect.* Wedded to geo-economics, the Clinton team at first failed to gave his concerns their due. What made the difference was last September's rape of the schoolgirl and the wave of anti-American demonstrations that followed. Supported by much of the Japanese press, the demonstrators argued that it was outrageous for Japan to pay 70% of the cost of maintaining American bases on its soil, if American servicemen behaved so badly. Even politicians on whom America had previously relied failed to speak out in defence of the security treaty. In Washington, the Defence Department's vague concern turned into ""real panic"", in the words of one of Mr Nye's advisers.
Half a hope on trade
That was enough to produce Mr Clinton's sudden switch to worrying about the military alliance. But is the switch anything more than a panic reaction? At first sight, it does not look like it. The prospects for keeping security at the top of the agenda with Japan are dim. Republicans are as reluctant as Democrats to return to the vigilance of the cold war; there are few votes in it. Richard Lugar, the one Republican presidential candidate to stress his knowledge of foreign affairs, got almost no votes in the primaries. At the State Department, old Japan hands marvel at how the tough congressional questions that they used to face have given way to yawning indifference. In sum, neither party seems interested in giving a consistently high priority to the security treaty with Japan.
That said, however, there remains half a hope that America will come back to security in future. It lies in the failure of Japanbashing trade policies.
When he goes to Tokyo, the president will no doubt claim credit for America's shrinking trade deficit with Japan (see chart on next page). But the truth is that this reflects the yen's rise to around Y107 to the dollar, up from Y126 when Mr Clinton took office. It does not reflect the trade talks initiated in 1993, because most of America's important demands have been turned down flat by Japanese officials. Japan-bashing has failed on its own terms.
Nor will it succeed any time soon.Japanese intransigence on trade is likely to prove permanent. During the 1970s and 198os Japan repeatedly yielded to foreigntrade demands, whether for access to its domestic market or for ""voluntary"" restraints upon its exports. But that was because Japan's firms were making miracle profits during their years of catch-up growth. Now that they are less flush, these firms are far less keen on ""generosity"".
Besides, the Japanese are now protected by the World Trade Organisation. During last year's car talks, America threatened to use its draconian ""Super 301"" trade law, which provides for punitive sanctions against countries deemed to be unfair traders. The Japanese said that they would challenge the legality of such a step under WTO rules. The counter-threat worked; the Americans backed down; the Japanese are not going to be cowed by Super 301 in future.
Japanese steadfastness is not the only reason why Japan-bashing has failed. The other is that bashing can backfire on America's own economic interests. Since the 1980s, the fear of a trade war has spread occasional panic through Wall Street. During last year's trade row, investors worried that, by forcing up the yen, American trade pressure might hasten a banking crisis in Japan, with ugly consequences for the American banks that do business with them. Not long afterwards, America's trade negotiators signed a deal on car trade that included little of what they had originally wanted.
None of this means that trade rows are gone. Mr Clinton will not be able to avoid mentioning several disputes next week, concerning photographic film, insurance and semiconductors. Decades of trade rows have produced an interest group of dispute-experts in Washington, who make a fine living by lobbying on behalf of firms trying to penetrate Japan and who know just how to keep trade rows active. But the limited gains from such disputes should at least mean that they are kept in check. No longer will they be pursued without regard to the security relationship.
Half-baked on security
If trade rows can be more-or-less contained, what of the other threats to the alliance? These come down to the idea that the security treaty, born of Japan's defeat in 1945, is now anachronistic. Some Americans argue that Japan has outgrown the need for American defence; as the world's second biggest economy, it should do its own soldiering. For their part, some Japanese feel that reliance on American troops is a slur on the nation's pride; they are fed up with being ""a mercantile nation that just writes cheques"", in the words of Mr Hashimoto. These are serious objections. General Douglas MacArthur, who ruled Japan from to 1951, likened Japan to a child in need of America's fatherly protection. The military alliance that he helped devise reflects this paternalism. America promises to protect Japan and to quench instability in Asia. In return, Japan merely offers bases for American troops. The Japanese do maintain a ""Self-Defence Force"" but its usefulness is stunted by Japan's pacifist constitution, which forbids going to war.
For a surprisingly long time, the alliance worked on the basis of America's conqueringSelf-confidence and Japan's corresponding humility. Until the 1970s, Americans continued to see Japan as a backward place where you could afford cheap maids; Japan continued to admire American ways and products. A deep self doubt possessed the Japanese, who were ashamed to sing the national anthem or raise the flag; some left-wingers regarded the Japanese state itself as illegitimate.
All this has been changed by Japan's stunning economic success. Now it is the Japanese who find America cheap, who complain that American workers are lazy and their products unreliable. Japan's flag and national anthem are no longer suppressed; the anti-nationalist left-wing has all but evaporated. The old self-doubt has been replaced by self-confidence, sometimes overblown. In many respects, Japanese reckon they know better than MacArthur's heirs-and plenty of Americans are willing to agree with them.
For at least a decade, therefore, the two countries' military alliance has seemed precariously lop-sided. Some critics, seeing that MacArthur's father-child arrangement has been slow to adapt, are starting to lose patience. Last year Chalmers Johnson, the president of the Japan Policy Research Institute, argued that Japan would never take more responsibility for its own defence while the American security treaty remained in place; he therefore called on his country to close down its Japanese bases.^ On Japan's side, a different version of this argument emerged. The rape, some said, proved that Americans behaved as though they were still members of an occupation force. The only way to cure Americans of their arrogance was to send them packing.
Complacency revisited
It will be easy for next week's summiteers to dismiss these extreme views. Only a small minority wants all American troops to go; a poll taken after last September's rape found that just 14% of Japanese held this opinion. But, having ignored the perils of geo-economics for too long, America had better not ignore this second set of threats. For the truth is that the security treaty is every bit as anachronistic as the critics charge Unless it is brought up to date, nobody should be surprised if the extremists multiply.
Indeed, the same poll demonstrates the dangers of complacency. Even fewer Japanese-just 7%-wanted the bases maintained at their current size; the vast major ity resented their presence, and wanted them scaled back gradually. More polls, assembled in a new book$, suggest that younger Japanese are more hostile to the bases than their elders; and that many doubt whether America would defend Japan in a crisis. In 199o, 62% of Japanese said that America would be a reliable ally; in 1994, only 47% did. At times a majority has said that the bases, by provoking enemy attack, may actually reduce Japan's security.
The alliance needs to be modified before such resentments undermine it. Since last autumn's rape, America has begun to take up this task The armed forces are preparing to hand back unneeded land-not the airbases, which America must keep if it is to deploy troops quickly in Asia and the Middle East, but housing estates and suchlike. Mr Clinton's visit will also bring the announcement of a scheme to involve Japan more in logistical support for American troops taking part in peacetime military exercises or peacekeeping operations. Japan's sense of involvement with the American forces on its soil ought to be promoted further. Japanese defence officials and diplomats seldom visit America's bases in Japan, and one recent exception to this rule suggests how valuable more exceptions could be. A month ago a group of bigwigs from Tokyo was loaded onto a buggy and driven past endless helicopters, tanks and other war materiel. All they could say was sugoi!, which means, roughly, Wow! They had heard Americans talk of their commitment to Japan. Now they had seen the evidence.
Some Japan hands in Washington discuss the sugoi factor and wonder how they can build on it. But the trouble is that a strong unilateralist strain remains in America's military policy, a tendency as marked in Asia as it was in Bosnia. When Bill Clinton sent aircraft carriers to watch over the Taiwan Strait recently, he did not forewarn the Japanese Left out of American plans, they are hardly likely to feel confident in American protection.
This matters, because Japan's leaders will need to feel more confidence in the alliance if they are to play their part in strengthening it. Japanese voters are even less keen than their American counterparts on expanding their military responsibilities abroad. Polls suggest that most Japanese think it wrong to use force to maintain international law; and that most doubt whether their country's military power will ever match its economic stature If the security treaty is to be modernised, a bold politician will have to look his countrymen in the eyes and demand that they rethink some of their most basic attitudes.
Scary as it may sound, the long-term health of the alliance with America may therefore hinge on Japan's chaotic politics Since 1993, a one-party system has given way to a chaos of competing splinter groups and then to something resembling two-party competition. Over the same three years, the country has been ruled by five different prime ministers. But, out of this mess, something promising has emerged Both the two main parties are led by men who want to expand Japan's responsibilities. These leaders need all the support they can get from their American friends. Mr Clinton's visit next week will be a start. But the finishing point remains distant.

Farther south, Indonesia has succession worries of its own; Hong Kong will revert to China next year; and Taiwan is trying to stave off a similar fate. In short, if the American-Japanese alliance frays, the miracle economies of the Pacific rim could set a second record for mankind. Having pulled off history's fastest ever advance in human welfare, they could next succumb to its fastest and nastiest reversal.
Trade troubles
How real are these dangers? Consider, first the possibility that trade rows will undermine America's partnership with Japan. Such disputes have dogged the alliance for many years, and the partnership has survived. In 1992, for instance, George Bush went to Tokyo brandishing a list of trade demands, flanked by industrialists demanding better access to Japanese markets. But the trade disputes seem to be getting worse-and have begun to jeopardise the security part of the partnership.
Mr Clinton came to power promising to redouble the commercial bias. Visiting Tokyo for the G7 summit in 1993, he turned his meeting with Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister of the time, into a trade negotiation. The defence treaty barely got a mention.
The Clinton team argued that, with the cold war at an end, geo-politics could give way to geo-economics. Communism had collapsed; or, where it had not, communists were too intent on getting rich to threaten anybody. In the absence of this threat, America could withdraw from the costly, tiring business of propping up allies and staring down foes. Instead, it should concentrate on economic goals, chiefly export promotion. If the pursuit of economic gain hurt cold-war ties, then so be it.
This thinking changed American policy. The Commerce Department saw its budget and prestige expand; the State Department grew demoralised. The biggest impact from this shift fell on America's dealings with Japan. Here was a country whose security role now seemed less crucial. And here was a country whose vast markets appeared closed to American products.With his trip to Tokyo in 1993, Mr Clinton inaugurated a policy of aggressive trade demands, untrammelled by concern for the wider partnership.
Three years later, Japan-bashing on trade has damaged relations between the two countries. An opinion poll taken in the middle of last year's acrimonious car talks found that friendly feelings between the two countries had hit a ten-year low. Japans trade minister of the time grew wildly popular by denouncing American demands; so popular, indeed, that he is now prime minister. Meanwhile, thuggish China and North Korea have demonstrated that the security alliance with Japan is as necessary as ever.
In 1995 Joseph Nye, a senior DefenceDepartment official, declared that the military alliance was suffering from neglect.* Wedded to geo-economics, the Clinton team at first failed to gave his concerns their due. What made the difference was last September's rape of the schoolgirl and the wave of anti-American demonstrations that followed. Supported by much of the Japanese press, the demonstrators argued that it was outrageous for Japan to pay 70% of the cost of maintaining American bases on its soil, if American servicemen behaved so badly. Even politicians on whom America had previously relied failed to speak out in defence of the security treaty. In Washington, the Defence Department's vague concern turned into ""real panic"", in the words of one of Mr Nye's advisers.
Half a hope on trade
That was enough to produce Mr Clinton's sudden switch to worrying about the military alliance. But is the switch anything more than a panic reaction? At first sight, it does not look like it. The prospects for keeping security at the top of the agenda with Japan are dim. Republicans are as reluctant as Democrats to return to the vigilance of the cold war; there are few votes in it. Richard Lugar, the one Republican presidential candidate to stress his knowledge of foreign affairs, got almost no votes in the primaries. At the State Department, old Japan hands marvel at how the tough congressional questions that they used to face have given way to yawning indifference. In sum, neither party seems interested in giving a consistently high priority to the security treaty with Japan.
That said, however, there remains half a hope that America will come back to security in future. It lies in the failure of Japanbashing trade policies.
When he goes to Tokyo, the president will no doubt claim credit for America's shrinking trade deficit with Japan (see chart on next page). But the truth is that this reflects the yen's rise to around Y107 to the dollar, up from Y126 when Mr Clinton took office. It does not reflect the trade talks initiated in 1993, because most of America's important demands have been turned down flat by Japanese officials. Japan-bashing has failed on its own terms.
Nor will it succeed any time soon.Japanese intransigence on trade is likely to prove permanent. During the 1970s and 198os Japan repeatedly yielded to foreigntrade demands, whether for access to its domestic market or for ""voluntary"" restraints upon its exports. But that was because Japan's firms were making miracle profits during their years of catch-up growth. Now that they are less flush, these firms are far less keen on ""generosity"".
Besides, the Japanese are now protected by the World Trade Organisation. During last year's car talks, America threatened to use its draconian ""Super 301"" trade law, which provides for punitive sanctions against countries deemed to be unfair traders. The Japanese said that they would challenge the legality of such a step under WTO rules. The counter-threat worked; the Americans backed down; the Japanese are not going to be cowed by Super 301 in future.
Japanese steadfastness is not the only reason why Japan-bashing has failed. The other is that bashing can backfire on America's own economic interests. Since the 1980s, the fear of a trade war has spread occasional panic through Wall Street. During last year's trade row, investors worried that, by forcing up the yen, American trade pressure might hasten a banking crisis in Japan, with ugly consequences for the American banks that do business with them. Not long afterwards, America's trade negotiators signed a deal on car trade that included little of what they had originally wanted.
None of this means that trade rows are gone. Mr Clinton will not be able to avoid mentioning several disputes next week, concerning photographic film, insurance and semiconductors. Decades of trade rows have produced an interest group of dispute-experts in Washington, who make a fine living by lobbying on behalf of firms trying to penetrate Japan and who know just how to keep trade rows active. But the limited gains from such disputes should at least mean that they are kept in check. No longer will they be pursued without regard to the security relationship.
Half-baked on security
If trade rows can be more-or-less contained, what of the other threats to the alliance? These come down to the idea that the security treaty, born of Japan's defeat in 1945, is now anachronistic. Some Americans argue that Japan has outgrown the need for American defence; as the world's second biggest economy, it should do its own soldiering. For their part, some Japanese feel that reliance on American troops is a slur on the nation's pride; they are fed up with being ""a mercantile nation that just writes cheques"", in the words of Mr Hashimoto. These are serious objections. General Douglas MacArthur, who ruled Japan from to 1951, likened Japan to a child in need of America's fatherly protection. The military alliance that he helped devise reflects this paternalism. America promises to protect Japan and to quench instability in Asia. In return, Japan merely offers bases for American troops. The Japanese do maintain a ""Self-Defence Force"" but its usefulness is stunted by Japan's pacifist constitution, which forbids going to war.
For a surprisingly long time, the alliance worked on the basis of America's conqueringSelf-confidence and Japan's corresponding humility. Until the 1970s, Americans continued to see Japan as a backward place where you could afford cheap maids; Japan continued to admire American ways and products. A deep self doubt possessed the Japanese, who were ashamed to sing the national anthem or raise the flag; some left-wingers regarded the Japanese state itself as illegitimate.
All this has been changed by Japan's stunning economic success. Now it is the Japanese who find America cheap, who complain that American workers are lazy and their products unreliable. Japan's flag and national anthem are no longer suppressed; the anti-nationalist left-wing has all but evaporated. The old self-doubt has been replaced by self-confidence, sometimes overblown. In many respects, Japanese reckon they know better than MacArthur's heirs-and plenty of Americans are willing to agree with them.
For at least a decade, therefore, the two countries' military alliance has seemed precariously lop-sided. Some critics, seeing that MacArthur's father-child arrangement has been slow to adapt, are starting to lose patience. Last year Chalmers Johnson, the president of the Japan Policy Research Institute, argued that Japan would never take more responsibility for its own defence while the American security treaty remained in place; he therefore called on his country to close down its Japanese bases.^ On Japan's side, a different version of this argument emerged. The rape, some said, proved that Americans behaved as though they were still members of an occupation force. The only way to cure Americans of their arrogance was to send them packing.
Complacency revisited
It will be easy for next week's summiteers to dismiss these extreme views. Only a small minority wants all American troops to go; a poll taken after last September's rape found that just 14% of Japanese held this opinion. But, having ignored the perils of geo-economics for too long, America had better not ignore this second set of threats. For the truth is that the security treaty is every bit as anachronistic as the critics charge Unless it is brought up to date, nobody should be surprised if the extremists multiply.
Indeed, the same poll demonstrates the dangers of complacency. Even fewer Japanese-just 7%-wanted the bases maintained at their current size; the vast major ity resented their presence, and wanted them scaled back gradually. More polls, assembled in a new book$, suggest that younger Japanese are more hostile to the bases than their elders; and that many doubt whether America would defend Japan in a crisis. In 199o, 62% of Japanese said that America would be a reliable ally; in 1994, only 47% did. At times a majority has said that the bases, by provoking enemy attack, may actually reduce Japan's security.
The alliance needs to be modified before such resentments undermine it. Since last autumn's rape, America has begun to take up this task The armed forces are preparing to hand back unneeded land-not the airbases, which America must keep if it is to deploy troops quickly in Asia and the Middle East, but housing estates and suchlike. Mr Clinton's visit will also bring the announcement of a scheme to involve Japan more in logistical support for American troops taking part in peacetime military exercises or peacekeeping operations. Japan's sense of involvement with the American forces on its soil ought to be promoted further. Japanese defence officials and diplomats seldom visit America's bases in Japan, and one recent exception to this rule suggests how valuable more exceptions could be. A month ago a group of bigwigs from Tokyo was loaded onto a buggy and driven past endless helicopters, tanks and other war materiel. All they could say was sugoi!, which means, roughly, Wow! They had heard Americans talk of their commitment to Japan. Now they had seen the evidence.
Some Japan hands in Washington discuss the sugoi factor and wonder how they can build on it. But the trouble is that a strong unilateralist strain remains in America's military policy, a tendency as marked in Asia as it was in Bosnia. When Bill Clinton sent aircraft carriers to watch over the Taiwan Strait recently, he did not forewarn the Japanese Left out of American plans, they are hardly likely to feel confident in American protection.
This matters, because Japan's leaders will need to feel more confidence in the alliance if they are to play their part in strengthening it. Japanese voters are even less keen than their American counterparts on expanding their military responsibilities abroad. Polls suggest that most Japanese think it wrong to use force to maintain international law; and that most doubt whether their country's military power will ever match its economic stature If the security treaty is to be modernised, a bold politician will have to look his countrymen in the eyes and demand that they rethink some of their most basic attitudes.
Scary as it may sound, the long-term health of the alliance with America may therefore hinge on Japan's chaotic politics Since 1993, a one-party system has given way to a chaos of competing splinter groups and then to something resembling two-party competition. Over the same three years, the country has been ruled by five different prime ministers. But, out of this mess, something promising has emerged Both the two main parties are led by men who want to expand Japan's responsibilities. These leaders need all the support they can get from their American friends. Mr Clinton's visit next week will be a start. But the finishing point remains distant.

Mr Clinton and his entourage arrived in Japan for a three-day state visit on April 16th. But despite the tightest of Japanese security, only a stalled engine prevented an armful of Molotov cocktails from being hurled. The would-be terrorist was arrested before the festivities got under way, when his van broke down outside the Diet (parliament) building.
There were few surprises to come out of Mr Clinton's visit to Japan. The two leaders' joint declaration-reaffirming the importance of the bilateral security alliance-had been heavily trailed for weeks. The only new note struck this week was the joint American-South Korean proposal, issued in South Korea on the first leg of Mr Clinton's East Asian trip, for four-party talks aimed at achieving a formal peace on the Korean peninsula. China has already responded positively. If the North Koreans also give their approval, it may yet be a breakthrough. Japan also has a keen interest in a peaceful Korean peninsula. Evidently caught by surprise, and lacking any concrete proposals from his own flustered bureaucrats, Mr Hashimoto was left calling the four-party idea a welcome start.
With elections looming in both America and Japan, both sides were anxious to avoid any hint of discord or disappointment. A few days before leaving Washington, Mr Clinton made a point of hailing last summer's acrimonious trade negotiations as a momentous success. They had, he claimed, boosted sales of American cars and motor parts in Japan by 35%. In Tokyo, the president went on to say that the 2l trade agreements signed with Japan over the past three years have increased American exports to Japan by 85%.
Behind the scenes, America is still haggling hard over access to Japan's markets for insurance, semiconductors and photographic materials. And there may soon be another row over the White House's determination to renew the ten-year-old semiconductor agreement that guarantees American chip makers at least 2o% of the Japanese market. But, on at least the more visible aspects of trade with Japan, the White House has decided to declare victory and go home.
Mr Hashimoto also has a victory to point to. In agreeing to hand back the huge Futenma air station, along with ten other military bases in Okinawa (some 4,700 hectares all told, 20% of the land used by America on the tiny southern island), Mr Clinton has given the Japanese prime minister a potentially election-winning concession. Mr Hashimoto has sometimes cited Eisaku Sato, a former Japanese prime minister, as his political hero. Sato persuaded the Americans to hand Okinawa back to Japanese control in 1972. Now Mr Hashimoto can also claim to have won back some Japanese territory.
But although this concession may seem to risk weakening the security ties between America and Japan, behind the scenes the Clinton administration has secured significant agreements on issues that America has had on its agenda for years. The most important is a bilateral ""acquisition and cross-servicing"" agreement that America has been pushing for since 1988. This allows Japan to provide fuel and parts for weapons to American forces during joint exercises and UN peacekeeping operations, and is seen in Washington as the first step towards getting Japan to provide much of the logistics in the event of a crisis in Asia. Such an agreement, if it could be applied in wartime, not just peacetime, would make a huge difference if fighting were ever to break out on the Korean peninsula.
Another important concession from Japan that Mr Clinton can rightly claim as a success-though he probably will not trumpet it too loudly at home-is the tacit agreement that the number of American troops stationed in the country (some 47,000 all told) will not be reduced. Japan has also agreed to foot the bill, estimated at $to billion, for moving elsewhere in Japan the various military facilities that America has agreed to close over the next five to seven years. Just building a new runway at an existing American base, so Futenma's functions can be transferred, is expected to cost Japanese taxpayers nearly $4 billion.
Above all, however, the Americans have won the argument that, with the cold war over, the security alliance between the two countries cannot stay as lopsided as it has been till now. The two governments have agreed to strengthen their military ties, with Japan playing an increasing part in helping to defend itself. Moreover, although Japan still rules out ""collective"" action, shoulder-to-shoulder with its allies, in pursuit of wider security in the region, the debate inside Japan about the proper, responsible role for its armed forces has been given a new push. With luck this could bring about a further strengthening of East Asia's most important alliance.

After President Bill Clinton's recent visit to Tokyo, which produced an agreement to ""realign"" the American-Japanese security treaty, Japan's government has suddenly had to face up to the political realities of what it means to be a more equal partner in the pact.
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, agreed to study the idea of letting Japan's armed forces provide assistance to America's armed forces in military conflicts outside Japanese territory. No one expects-at least not in the foreseeable future-that Japanese soldiers will be fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with Americans in a war on, say, the Korean peninsula. But it is certainly now possible to imagine refugees disembarking from American military transporters at civil airports in Japan, or American warships being refuelled in Japanese ports.
The agreement signed by the two leaders in Tokyo on April 17th also makes provisions for Japanese and American troops to supply one another with spare parts and fuel (though not ammunition) during military exercises, UN peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions abroad. Anything more than that, the treaty's critics claim, is forbidden by Japan's constitution. In 1981, the Japanese government chose to interpret the constitution as prohibiting it from engaging in ""collective defence""-that is, fighting alongside allies abroad. In reality, the relevant article of the constitution is ambiguous.
Nervous about the political repercussions of his agreement with Mr Clinton, Mr Hashimoto has spent the past week assuring the Diet (parliament) that all discussions on the issue will remain within the framework of the constitution. He went to particular pains to scotch suggestions that any realignment of the joint security treaty would expand the area covered by the pact-from what it just calls the Far East to the whole of the Asia-Pacific region. The term Far East used in the treaty is usually interpreted to mean Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and the surrounding seas.
But Yukihiko Ikeda, Japan's foreign minister, has indicated that the interpretation of the words Far East could change with the circumstances. Seiroku Kajiyama, the chief cabinet secretary, has gone further, suggesting that the area covered by the pact with the Americans might easily extend to the South Pacific and South-East-Asia.
Many believe that Mr Hashimoto is underestimating the public's willingness to see Japan shoulder a greater share of the region's security. Commentators in the media love to talk about Japan's ""staunch antiwar sentiments"". And it is true that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki left incurable scars on a generation of Japanese. But for younger Japanese, those events are less potent.
There is an undeniable reluctance to discuss security matters publicly in Japan. But that may have little to do with pacifist sentiment. The Japanese have simply been shielded from such considerations by the existence of a joint security pact. With the Americans guaranteeing their defence and providing all the contingency plans for military threats in the region, the Japanese people have simply got on with life.
But ordinary Japanese might welcome a less timid approach to security. When asked about their feelings in a poll after Mr Clinton's visit, 69% said they were satisfied with the new security arrangement-under which America will close ii military bases and consolidate its forces elsewhere in Japan, while keeping its 47,000 troops in the country. And 49% professed themselves satisfied that the joint security agreement was about to be beefed up to give Japan a wider role and a bigger say in helping to maintain stability in the region.
The findings tally with views that have been expressed increasingly in Japan since the Gulf war. The Japanese took justifiable pride in seeing their minesweepers move into the sea-lanes round the Gulf after the fighting had ended-an action permissible because it was done under the auspices of the UN. Since then, government surveys have continued to find strong support for Japan's participation in UN peacekeeping operations-notably in Cambodia and Mozambique. When asked, three out of four Japanese approve of sending the country's troops abroad.
Mr Hashimoto and his colleagues in the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest member of the ruling coalition, have their reasons for tip-toeing around the security issue. And not just because they believe the topic is taboo. They are governing in coalition with the Social Democrats. a party that until recently opposed the very notion of the American-Japanese alliance.

More claims may be on the way. Historians reckon that up to 200,000 young women and girls around Asia were put into brothels by the occupying Japanese forces. Many are now dead, but their survivors want compensation and an apology. 
Last July, the previous Japanese prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, set up an Asian Women's Fund to deal with the problem. Although it has government backing, the fund is formally private. On May 20th, the directors of the fund are to decide how much the compensation should be, and to start making payments soon after. The payouts are expected to amount to 2m ($19,000) apiece, down considerably from the Y3m-4m originally mooted. Mr Hashimoto has been told that, without an accompanying apology from the government, the former sex slaves (euphemistically referred to in Japan as comfort women"") have threatened to hurl the money back. 
Pressure on Mr Hashimoto to apologise owes much to the awe of the Miki family name in the Liberal Democratic Party(LDP). As poor as a shrine-sweeper, Takeo Miki, a prime minister in the 1970s, was one of the cleanest people in Japanese politics. His widow, Mutsuko Miki, is viewed (slightly uncomfortably) by LDP members as the epitome of the political standards they feel they ought to be embracing these days. The redoubtable Mrs Miki, who works widely on behalf of women's groups around Asia, recently resigned her unpaid job as a promoter of the Asian Women's Fund, releasing a broadside against Mr Hashimoto and the government for trying to avoid dealing with the issue directly. 
The government's line on Japan's wartime victims has been that all outstanding claims were settled with the signing of a peace treaty with America in 1951 and subsequent treaties signed with Japan's various Asian neighbours. But pressure has been mounting lately for Japan to show some form of tangible-and official-remorse for its army's wartime behaviour. In the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists urged Japan to pay each of the former comfort women $40,000 in compensation as an interim measure. Then, last February, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights suggested that, apart from compensating the women directly, Japan ought to consider prosecuting any surviving officials involved in recruiting for the brothels and to make the official records public. 
The socialist Mr Murayama not only or-- ganised the Asian Women's Fund; he offered to send personal letters of apology to each survivor. But, since taking over as head of the coalition government in February, the LDP'S Mr Hashimoto has sought to distance himself from the whole business. 
So far, the private fund has collected only V330m, mostly from big business. Though refusing to chip in, the government has actually spent more than 600m in publicising the scheme and providing ministerial staff to run it. It may now have to spend much more. 
Insiders reckon there is little hope of raising privately the Vi billion needed to give the fund even the barest of international credibility. Meanwhile, plans for providing compensation (and apologies) to all the former comfort women, including those in China, Myanmar, Indonesia and the Netherlands, have had to be shelved. In the process, all hopes of keeping the compensation plan quietly unofficial are dwindling fast. 
The talk now among the women's supporters is to start a boycott throughout Asia of Japanese goods. Mr Hashimoto continues his frequent breakfast meetings with Japan's captains of industry in the forlorn hope of getting them to give more, but increasingly it looks as though he will have to do what he has feared most-dig deeply into the public purse to prevent the comfort women from becoming yet another government embarrassment. ","LIKE it or not , Ryutaro Hashimoto has had to accept that Ryutaro Hashimoto will have to write a letter of apology , on Japan 's behalf , to each of the 300 or so women in South Korea , Taiwan and the Philippines who are claiming compensation for being forced into army brothels during the second world war . More claims may be on the way . Historians reckon that up to 200,000 young women and girls around Asia were put into brothels by the occupying Japanese forces . Many are now dead , but their survivors want compensation and an apology . 
 Last July , the previous Japanese prime minister , Tomiichi Murayama , set up an Asian Women 's Fund to deal with the problem . Although it has government backing , the fund is formally private . On May 20th , the directors of the fund are to decide how much the compensation should be , and to start making payments soon after . The payouts are expected to amount to 2 m ( $ 19,000 ) apiece , down considerably from the Y3m-4 m originally mooted . Ryutaro Hashimoto has been told that , without an accompanying apology from the government , the former sex slaves ( euphemistically referred to in Japan as comfort women "" ) have threatened to hurl the money back . 
 Pressure on Ryutaro Hashimoto to apologise owes much to the awe of the Miki family name in the Liberal Democratic Party(LDP ) . As poor as a shrine - sweeper , Takeo Miki , a prime minister in the 1970s , was one of the cleanest people in Japanese politics .

May 24th is likely to be another. That is when the country's ten city (or commercial) banks are due to report their 1995 results. On most estimates, their write-offs of bad loans will total some Y6.2 trillion (($64 billion) and their net losses will be around Y1.7 trillion. When all their results have ben announced by the end of the month, the top 20 banks will probably have written off Y10.8 trillion of duff loans and have announced total net losses of about Y3.3 trillion. 
By increasing their reserves against bad loans, the banks will have at least gone some way to putting their problems behind them. But they are not in the clear yet. For one thing, they are under renewed pressure to contribute more to the cost of liquidating Japan's ailing jusen, or mortgage lenders, because a government plan to spend 685 billion of taxpayers' cash on the firms is blocked by public opposition. On May 10th Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, added his voice to those urging the banks to put up more cash. 
Worse, despite the massive write-offs, banks' reported level of bad loans will probably not fall. Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, an American investment bank, reckons that it may in fact rise by over 9% because the finance ministry is now widening the definition of bad loans that must be reported to include those for which a bank is providing any form of support for a borrower. 
Nor are banks' profits likely to be as fat next year as this one. At around Y4.2 trillion, operating profits for the past financial year will have been higher than ever before. Most of this profit comes from bond and swap portfolios, whose value has been swollen by extremely low interest rates. As the economy picks up, rates will rise and operating profits will fall. 
And lending is still horribly unprofitable. Given the excess capacity within the industry, this is not surprising. Lending to big companies, which accounts for 30% of domestic loans, now earns banks only oneeighth of a percentage point over their cost of funds; taking into account their various administrative costs, they probably lose money. Yet banks have continued to lend to such firms partly because they think that this cements relationships with them, and partly because it helps them to win other, more profitable sorts of business from the firms' subsidiaries. 
There are some signs that this may be about to change. On May loth Sumitomo Bank, Japan's fourth largest by assets, said that it wants to cut those assets by between 3% and 5%. Another big lender, the LongTerm Credit Bank, announced a similar move earlier in the year. In April, despite an improving economy, total loans grew by only 1.6%, compared with 2.2% the previous month. Other banks claim that, at the very least, they want to reduce lending to big companies and to focus instead on issuing bonds for them, or on more profitable lending to small and medium-sized firms, and to individuals. 
Yet even this shift will be difficult, reckons David Atkinson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, another American investment bank. The problem is, again, one of size. At the beginning of the last financial year, lending to big companies by the city banks mounted to 65 trillion. The banks already account for half of non-mortgage retail lending and a bit less of lending to small- and medium-sized companies. So unless the economy grows fast enough, it will be hard for them to shed loans to big companies and replace them with a similar amount of loans to other customers. 
Moreover, although lots of banks talk about shedding assets, few apart from Sumitomo are keen to shrink their loan books. They do not want to sack loan officers or risk losing clients. More important, they have nothing else to do with their capital (and are reluctant to give it back to shareholders Unless this changes soon, this forthcoming set of dreadful results will not be the last.

The coming few weeks are crucial: by the end of the summer the money the government threw at the economy to get it moving will have been largely spent. By then, it is hoped, public spending will have been replaced by private-sector and foreign demand. The public sector can do little more; its armoury is almost empty. 
Few doubted the need to help the economy. After the collapse in 199o, it limped along thanks only to large dollops of public cash. Then, last year, consumer confidence was devastated by the earthquake in Kobe, the nerve-gas attack in Tokyo, the crisis in the country's banking system and, above all, the rampant yen. A deflationary abyss lay ahead. 
In September, the Bank of Japan pared official interest rates to o.5%. Together with other central banks, it intervened heavily in the foreign-exchange market to push the yen down. Between March 1995 and May this year, Japan's foreign-exchange reserves soared from $141.5 billion to $208 billion. But the biggest single boost to the economy was the Y9.5 trillion ($88 billion) the government poured into public works last year, the largest fiscal stimulus ever. 
This public cash worked at least some Keynesian magic. In the last quarter of last year,Japan's GDP grew by an annual rate of 3.6%; most economists believe that growth in the first quarter of this year was even stronger. The question is what happens now. The macroeconomic weapons have been used up. Short-term interest rates cannot go much lower; intervention will be less effective now that the yen is more fairly valued and, although some people talk of a Y2 trillion supplementary budget before long, that will probably be the last. The country's finances are in a mess and the government cannot continue to print money.Japan's gross public-sector debt has rocketed from 63% of GDP in 1991 to perhaps 95% this year, and the budget deficit will exceed 6% of GDP in 1996. 
The finance ministry is determined to stop the rot. It is likely to insist on a planned increase in the consumption (sales) tax from 3% to 5% next April, and on the abandonment at the end of the year of an income-tax rebate worth Y2 trillion a year to wage-earners. Russell Jones, chief economist at the Tokyo office of Lehman Brothers, an investment bank, says that borrowing much more to throw at the economy would probably be counterproductive: bond investors would start to fret about the increased risk of default and demand higher interest rates. 
Much, therefore, depends on increased demand from companies and consumers. All eyes will be on a Bank of Japan survey of business confidence, due to be released on June 7th. Some signs are already encouraging. Most indicators for companies' capital spending, such as business confidence and capacity utilisation, are up. Retailers are ringing up stronger sales; companies are starting to hire school-leavers again and, taking advantage of low mortgage rates, people are rushing to buy houses. 
Yet there are still worries. In the final quarter of last year, the latest figures available, consumption grew by a meagre 2% and companies' capital spending by less than 5%. Consumer confidence will continue to be dented by falling land prices and record unemployment, and companies' capital spending by worryingly high stocks. And the yen's recent loss of strength has not dented Japanese companies' eagerness to move production overseas. Against economists' expectations, the visible-trade surplus has continued to fall in the face of a weaker yen: in April it dropped by an astonishing 66%, to Y321 billion. 
Even if enough has been done to rescue the Japanese economy from its trough, it will not be the all-conquering version of the late 1980s. In the years of the bubble economy, the real economy piggy-backed on ludicrously inflated financial-asset prices. When they collapsed, so did the real economy. The late 1990s version will be much less showy; Japan's will look much like any other mature economy. 
To get round the effects of the high yen, high domestic labour costs and trade pressures, big companies have shifted production abroad. Overseas production of Japanese goods is rising by o.5% of GDP a year. This is one reason why Japan's current-account surplus has continued to shrink so dramatically. At some stage these firms will start sacking people in Japan. No longer is it true that what is good for Toyota is good for Japan-or at least for all Japanese. Firms such as Toyota operate on a truly global scale; then there are the rest. The difference between them is growing, partly because companies such as the big car makers are shifting costs on to their smaller domestic brethren and partly because the domestic economy is itself opening up. 
Whether domestic firms will be able to respond to such competition depends on how quickly Japan deregulates. The housing, labour and financial markets, for example, are still coddled by bureaucrats. Even the small amount of deregulation in distribution and retailing, reckons the oEcD, will add o.75% to Japanese GDP over the next five years. The deregulated mobiletelephone industry has expanded beyond anyone's dreams. 
Even deregulation would not bring Japan the heady growth rates it had in the 1970s and 1980s; rather, it might bring the 2-3% typical of other mature economies. And it is still questionable whether politicians have the stomach for change. Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, does not exude deregulatory fervour. At present, however, the economy is still in the hands of bureaucrats, who are even less keen.

In January, the blunt-talking leader of the New Frontier Party,Japan's biggest opposition group, seemed to hold all the trumps. The new government led by Ryutaro Hashimoto was based on an uneasy alliance between dominant conservatives in the shape of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), a lesser number of socialists (who nowadays call themselves Social Democrats) and a much smaller group, the New Party Sakigake. The government faced the unpleasant task of forcing a bill through the Diet (parliament) to liquidate seven virtually bankrupt jusen, or mortgage lenders, with generous help from the public purse. Since few taxpayers wanted their cash spent in this way, Mr Ozawa had a great opportunity to dish the government-perhaps even to force an early election and grab power. 
Things have turned out rather differ ently. Despite the opposition's efforts, the government at last pushed the jusen bills through the all-important lower house of the Diet on June 7th. Yet far from gaining from its opposition, the New Frontier Party's efforts have backfired. The opinion polls put its popularity at a measly 9%, compared with 35% for the LDP. The cabinet's approval ratings, which fell sharply af ter Mr Hashimoto became prime minister, are now back over 5o%. On present trends, the LDP will romp home in the next election. This will be held, most people now think, late this year or early next. 
The New Frontier Party, on the other hand, is in danger of splintering. If it does, the LDP would probably get the overall majority necessary to restore the unchallenged power that it enjoyed for nearly 40 years before losing office in 1993. 
So what did Mr Ozawa do wrong? Despite his reputation abroad as a reformer this week he was in Europe schmoozing with the great and the good-he was a late convert to the politics of ideas. Until he left the LDP in 1993, he had made his career as a thuggish behind-the-scenes fixer. Many Japanese remain unconvinced by his apparent conversion to loftier principles. 
Everything that Mr Ozawa has done to hold up the jusen bills has reinforced this scepticism. Instead of coming up with a persuasive alternative, his party simply tried to block the jusen package by barring all entry to the committee room in which it was to be discussed. Politics rather than principle also seemed to be behind Mr Ozawa's attempt to single out the LDP's secretary-general, Koichi Kato, for investigation. Mr Ozawa wanted to exploit divisions between the LDP's younger generation, led by Mr Kato, and its old guard. 
The first indication that Mr Ozawa's tactics were failing came at the end of March, when the LDP won a by-election with a thumping majority. The opposition promptly ended its three-week blockade. 
Since then matters have got worse. When Mr Kato eventually appeared before the Diet on June 4th, he simply denied allegations that he had received any donations from companies connected to the jusen This week the jusen package was eventually passed with its V685 billion ($6.3 billion) of public cash intact 
Japanese voters are used to shady politicians. After all, the unholy alliance between the LDP and the socialists hardly oozes principle. But voters also expect politicians to be effective. And whereas Mr Hashimoto has been hobnobbing with President Bill Clinton and can claim some credit as a member of the government that has got the economy moving again, Mr Ozawa, in the eyes of the public, has achieved very little. 
This, added to Mr Ozawa's authoritarian manner, has widened divisions among the three main factions in the New Frontier Party: loyal supporters of Mr Ozawa; a liberal faction led by Tsutomu Hata and Morihiro Hosokawa, two former prime ministers; and some Diet-members connected to the Soka Gakkai, a lay Buddhist movement. 
The Soka Gakkai's importance to the New Frontier Party is that it can deliver both money and votes. Its share of the vote has remained at &to% for the past 50 years. But its parliamentary sympathisers have no particular loyalty to the New Frontier Party and the Soka Gakkai has recently been flirting with the LDP. 
For the time being, though, it is the liberal wing of the New Frontier Party that is most disenchanted with Mr Ozawa. It dislikes his authoritarianism, not to mention his desire to let Japanese troops fight abroad under the United Nations' flag. 
Some of the younger members of the party are keen to set up a new party with likeminded liberals from other parties. Chief rebel is Hajime Funada, a party bigwig until he was obliged to step down in late May for ""careless"" remarks about his desire to set up a new grouping. Mr Funada may make his move this autumn. 
Yet Mr Funada and other possible defectors from the party, even, potentially, Messrs Hosokawa and Hata, are in no rush. The reason-and this is the best hope for the New Frontier Party remaining intact for a while yet-is that the next general election will be conducted under new rules. The present multi-member constituencies will be replaced by 300 single-member constituencies and 200 seats elected from a party list by proportional representation. Under this new system, a divided opposition might be trounced by the LDP. Mr Ozawa, moreover, has a formidable reputation for winning elections and raising the where withal to do so. 
But Mr Ozawa's critics within the New Frontier Party are becoming more vocal. And the longer that Mr Hashimoto puts off the next election, the harder it will become for Mr Ozawa to hold the New Frontier Party together-and the greater the chance that the LDP will come to see the past three years as merely a blip in its post-war dominance of the political landscape.

 Everything that Mr Ozawa has done to hold up the jusen bills has reinforced this scepticism . Instead of coming up with a persuasive alternative , his party simply tried to block the jusen package by barring all entry to the committee room in which it was to be discussed . Politics rather than principle also seemed to be behind Mr Ozawa 's attempt to single out the LDP 's secretary - general , Koichi Kato , for investigation . Mr Ozawa wanted to exploit divisions between the LDP 's younger generation , led by Mr Kato , and its old guard . 
 The first indication that Mr Ozawa 's tactics were failing came at the end of March , when the LDP won a by - election with a thumping majority . The opposition promptly ended its three - week blockade . 
 Since then matters have got worse . When Mr Kato eventually appeared before the Diet on June 4th , he simply denied allegations that he had received any donations from companies connected to the jusen This week the jusen package was eventually passed with its V685 billion ( $ 6.3 billion ) of public cash intact 
 Japanese voters are used to shady politicians . After all , the unholy alliance between the LDP and the socialists hardly oozes principle . But voters also expect politicians to be effective . And whereas Mr Hashimoto has been hobnobbing with President Bill Clinton and can claim some credit as a member of the government that has got the economy moving again , Mr Ozawa , in the eyes of the public , has achieved very little . 
 This , added to Mr Ozawa 's authoritarian manner , has widened divisions among the three main factions in the New Frontier Party : loyal supporters of Mr Ozawa ; a liberal faction led by Tsutomu Hata and Morihiro Hosokawa , two former prime ministers ; and some Diet - members connected to the Soka Gakkai , a lay Buddhist movement . 
 The Soka Gakkai 's importance to the New Frontier Party is that it can deliver both money and votes . Its share of the vote has remained at & to% for the past 50 years . But its parliamentary sympathisers have no particular loyalty to the New Frontier Party and the Soka Gakkai has recently been flirting with the LDP . 
 For the time being , though , it is the liberal wing of the New Frontier Party that is most disenchanted with Mr Ozawa . It dislikes his authoritarianism , not to mention his desire to let Japanese troops fight abroad under the United Nations ' flag . 
 Some of the younger members of the party are keen to set up a new party with likeminded liberals from other parties . Chief rebel is Hajime Funada , a party bigwig until he was obliged to step down in late May for "" careless "" remarks about his desire to set up a new grouping . Mr Funada may make his move this autumn . 
 Yet Mr Funada and other possible defectors from the party , even , potentially , Messrs Hosokawa and Hata , are in no rush . The reason - and this is the best hope for the New Frontier Party remaining intact for a while yet - is that the next general election will be conducted under new rules . The present multi - member constituencies will be replaced by 300 single - member constituencies and 200 seats elected from a party list by proportional representation . Under this new system , a divided opposition might be trounced by the LDP . Mr Ozawa , moreover , has a formidable reputation for winning elections and raising the where withal to do so . 
 But Mr Ozawa 's critics within the New Frontier Party are becoming more vocal . And the longer that Mr Hashimoto puts off the next election , the harder it will become for Mr Ozawa to hold the New Frontier Party together - and the greater the chance that the LDP will come to see the past three years as merely a blip in its post - war dominance of the political landscape .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,The new government led by Ryutaro Hashimoto,4,True

Unable to choose between Japan and South Korea, FIFA, the world authority for association football, decided in frustration to make the two rival contenders hold the World Cup in 2002 jointly. That created an excuse for Kim Young Sam, the president of South Korea, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister of Japan, to hold a two-day meeting to start preparations for the football tournament. 
In fact, sport seems hardly to have been mentioned. But the meeting, held on the picturesque Korean island of Cheju on June 22nd and 23rd, ended with hangovers of the worthiest sort. Asked what they talked about while sharing a bottle or two privately after the official banquet, Mr Hashimoto joked: ""I forget:' The two leaders clearly enjoyed the informal get-together. And before going their separate ways, both enthusiastically arranged a return match. The carousing next time is to be in the Japanese mountains. 
What President Kim and Mr Hashimoto, both of whom are known to enjoy the occasional drink, recalled of their working sessions was that they cleared the air on a number of issues that have soured relations between South Korea and Japan lately. Both sides concentrated on rebuilding diplomatic relations that have been battered by a recent storm over the sovereignty of a set of islets, as well as compensation for Korean women who were forced during wartime to become ""comfort women"" (sexual slaves) for the Japanese army. 
The two leaders confirmed the framework hammered out in Bangkok earlier this year for deciding the boundary between their respective zoo-nautical-mile economic zones. A new fisheries agreement that takes the territorial dispute into account is to be negotiated. Above all, both sides agreed to discuss the future, instead of dwelling on the bitterness that has divided them in the past. But first Mr Hashimoto did what was expected of him and apologised for the brutal way Japan ruled Korea after annexing the country in 191o and to the surviving ""comfort women"". To set the record straight, the two leaders agreed to finance an authoritative study of Japanese and Korean history. 
Such a study is certainly needed. As recently as 1984, the Japanese government commissioned a study of Japan's history and its relations with Korea that drew heavily on nationalistic fabrications invented during the late 19th century. One of the most popular tales of the time was that the southern part of Korea had been a colony of Japan during the fourth and fifth centuries, while the rest of the peninsula had been ruled by China. Despite being the second-oldest kingdom in the world, with 2,ooo years of unbroken rule under the Cilla, Koryeo and Choseon dynasties, Korea was said to have no historical legitimacy-and Japan therefore had an historical right to reclaim it. 
To this day, Japanese schoolchildren are brainwashed into believing that, historically, Koreans are inferior. Little mention is made of the contemporary view by serious Japanese and western scholars that Yamato (ancient Japan) was settled largely in the fourth century by horse-riding tribes from the Korean peninsula. Even in academic circles, it is still taboo to suggest that the Japanese imperial family is descended from a Korean clan. 
As far as recent history is concerned, the Koreans have taken similar liberties with the truth. The Chinese have complained about distortions in South Korean history books which suggest that the country spread across Manchuria in ancient times. Certainly, for the past half century, schoolchildren in Korea, North and South, have been inculcated with an image of the Japanese as being barbaric, warlike and racist. Worse still, they have failed to show proper gratitude for all the civilising gifts they have received from the Korean peninsula. Korean popular culture has kept alive a sense of outrage about the way the country was treated during colonial times, and fostered a self-righteous sense of animosity towards the Japanese. 
The irony is that the Koreans and the Japanese are cousins-far closer than, say, the British and the French. Though both share common features with other East Asian peoples, especially the Chinese and the Mongolians, there is practically nothing to distinguish the Japanese and Koreans from each other. 
Everyone must play 
If soccer diplomacy forces the Koreans and the Japanese to treat each other with more respect, that will be just as well. There is a pressing need for Japan and South Korea to get along better over the next few years. It may be that, well before soccer fans pour through the turnstiles in 2002, a crisis on the Korean peninsula will oblige Japan and South Korea to co-operate more closely. In the event of the internal collapse of North Korea, or of an attack across the border, South Korea would need swift and solid support not only from its main ally, the United States, but also from its cousin across the East Sea. 
Since President Clinton's visit to Tokyo in April to strengthen the security alliance between America and Japan, Mr Hashimoto and his government colleagues have become painfully aware that Japan will be expected to react if hostilities break out on the Korean peninsula. Korea is the Achilles heel of the American-Japanese security pact, says Ralph Cossa, head of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' office in Honolulu. A Japanese failure to provide adequate support for American troops engaged in the defence of South Korea would shatter the security treatyand might lead to the political and economic ostracism of Japan. It would be diplomatically out of the question for Japan to keep its 200 or so F-15 warplanes sitting on the ground, while American soldiers were dying on the Korean peninsula. 
So far the Japanese have argued that the South Koreans would not allow them to enter the fray. It is true that the joint declaration issued by President Clinton and Mr Hashimoto after their recent summit meeting in Tokyo has been widely denounced in Seoul. The declaration, emphasising the need for Japanese involvement in emergencies throughout the region, is seen as encouraging Japanese militarism.

His implication was that the job of a politician is to bring back pork, in the form of new roads, bridges or railways, to his constituents. Kanemaru was disgraced by scandal in 1992 and has since died, but his dictum is still observed: diligent distribution of cash rather than making speeches about national policy is how Japanese politicians get elected. 
The reform of the electoral system for Japan's lower house was supposed to help put a stop to grubby money politics. Under rules passed by the Diet (parliament) in 1994, multi-member constituencies will be abandoned for the next election, due by July 1997. Would-be members of parliament will fight for 300 single-member constituencies plus zoo seats filled by proportional representation. 
Just how these reforms are to reduce the influence of money in politics has always been a bit unclear. Some people have said that the new constituencies, with getting on for half the number of voters of the old ones, will mean that candidates will not have to spend so much money to secure election. Others have claimed that a candidate will find it impossibly expensive to buy the extra number of voters he needs to win a single-seat constituency. So money will play a secondary role. Candidates, runs this optimistic argument, will have to compete on policies. 
It is true that there are a few more political ideas floating around than there were. Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the New Frontier Party, the largest opposition group, has some good ideas about deregulating the Japanese economy (though they have singularly failed to grab the attention of most Japanese). Ryutaro Hashimoto has something that journalists are supposed to call vision. But, generally, the political debate in Japan has not noticeably moved to a higher plane. 
It is hard to see how it could have done. In parliament both the main opposition group and the government are uneasy coalitions of parties or groups of very different political persuasions. The government itself is a coalition of conservatives and socialists; their only common principles seem to be gleaned from the writings of Machiavelli. 
So it is largely business as usual. In Japan, this means staying in power by distributing goodies to and generally cultivating the local electorate. Politicians send flowers to the bereaved and cards and presents to newly-weds. They try to find jobs for their constituents. Most important, as Kanemaru pointed out, they do their best to distribute largesse from the central government. 
Many in the Diet, especially but not exclusively those in smaller parties, would now rather the reforms had never taken place; among those with second thoughts, it is believed, is Morihiro Hosokawa, who, as prime minister, pushed them through. Tomiichi Murayama, whose Social Democrats face extinction at the next election, and who preceded Mr Hashimoto as prime minister, made an abortive attempt in June to introduce a bill to reverse the electoral reforms. He will probably try again in October, when the Diet reconvenes. Takayoshi Miyagawa, a political pundit, reckons that around four-fifths of the Diet would support a move back to the old electoral system, or a variation of it. 
The problem for many politicians, but especially for newcomers to the Diet, is that money, far from becoming less important, has become more so. Candidates for the new single-member constituencies have some 75% more voters to consider. With three-fifths of the seats elected by simple majority voting, the risks of not having enough of the stuff are higher. Small parties and newcomers are squealing that they do not have the wherewithal. 
Who does? Generally those with inherited seats. Almost a third (163) of the seats in the present Diet are inherited; 20 years ago the proportion was less than lo%. Of today's 163 seats, io8 are held by Liberal Democrats-which, given that the LDP spent 38 years in power, is perhaps unsurprising (many of the rest are ex-LDP as well). The Japanese sum up the advantages of inherited seats in three words:jiban (control of the constituency organisation); kanban (the value of the family name); and kaban (the money bag). 
Diet members who do not belong to the LDP with its legendary grass-roots machinery, and have not inherited their seats, are panicking. Since selection for some singlemember seats means, inevitably, disappointment for the loser, there are thrilling battles in the LDP itself The best known of these is between two heavyweights: Keizo Obuchi, the right-hand man of Noboru Takeshita, who runs the biggest faction in the Liberal Democrats; and Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister. Both politicians come from Gunma prefecture. Both are desperate to lay their hands on the nomination for the constituency, since neither wants to suffer the indignity of being elected by proportional representation. Serious scraps for Liberal Democratic nominations are going on in zo other singlemember constituencies. 
The electorate should also be worried. Mr Miyagawa points out that Japan has introduced single-member constituencies twice before: for six general elections after the Diet was set up in 189o, and for two in the 192os. Both times single-member constituencies were subsequently abandoned in favour of multiple ones, partly because of an increase in corruption. In an opinion poll published in April, only 4% of people questioned thought that politics would be better as a result of these changes. 
However, the reforms are unlikely to be reversed. The committee in charge of organising the Diet's agenda is controlled by the LDP. More than any other party, it stands to gain if the new system wipes out smaller parties. All of which means that the Japanese will probably have a general election in the autumn, before the reforms can be reversed. And the LDP is likely to walk it.

TO MOST people these days, good government is three-level business. The bottom level is an intelligent, industrious and incorruptible civil service, entitled to send suggestions and criticisms up to the second level but in the end a dutiful executor of instructions. The second level is a political system of two or more parties, which publicly debate their rival ideas about what instructions the bureaucrats should be given. The top level is the voters, to whom the arguing parties submit the final choice between those ideas. Japan is not yet like this. The ground floor is a hive of zealous activity. But the floor above has never housed the sort of multi-party system now accepted from one end of Europe to the other, in almost all of the Americas and in much of southern Asia. As a result, the top floor is not yet in proper use. The edifice of Japanese democracy is still incomplete. 
Of course, Japan is not a one-party dictatorship. Even before the long-ruling Liberal Democrats seemed to come to pieces in 1993, it had various other parties, regular free elections and a voting system only moderately tilted to the rulers. But for practical purposes it remained a one-party state. This was partly because the other parties were never serious contenders for power. The Socialists and the Communists had retired into separate sub-sections of a Marxist dream-world; the other main political group, Komeito, was less a normal party than a kind of self-help club run by the Soka Gakkai, a lay Buddhist organisation. The voters, happy with the way the Liberal Democrats ran the economy until the 198os, dutifully trooped out to vote for them on election day. It was not unlike the Christian Democrats long supremacy in Italy, during the period when that country's Communists had similarly made themselves unelectable. 
The result was that from 1946 until 1993, except fora brief interlude in 1947-48,Japan's government was in the hands of the parties which in 1955 formally united themselves as the Liberal Democrats. The real struggle for power took place among the various factions of the Liberal Democrats, and in that struggle ideas played a much smaller part than clannish loyalty to one's own faction. 
This had two large consequences. Because the contest for power was a private one, inside the bosom of the Liberal Democrats, the big issues of the day seldom got referred to the voters for their decision. Instead, power moved downwards, as many of the issues lost in the dust of the Liberal Democrats' factional rivalries came to be decided by the civil servants. That is why so much of Japan's legislation has its origins within the ministries, and why the bureaucrats write not only the answers to parliamentary questions, as in other countries, but most of the questions too. If anything, the bureaucrats' power has grown even greater in the confusion that followed the crisis of 1993, when yet another scandal led an assortment of ambitious Liberal Democrats to break away from the party. By other countries' standards, Japan's government remains unacceptably bottom-heavy. 
Back to where they were 
Most people thought three years ago that the splintering of the Liberal Democrats would be the start of a real multi-party system, and that japan could now complete the building of a proper structure of government. It has not happened yet 
Only one group of 1993's ex-Liberal Democrat rebels, the New Frontier Party, still counts for much, and New Frontier is split. Its leader, Ichiro Ozawa, wants an ideas-based two-party system, but not all of his followers agree; worse, this indecisive New Frontier now awkwardly embraces the cautious conservatives of the former Komeito movement, who much prefer the old ways. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats, now led by Ryutaro Hashimoto, have manoeuvred their way back into power by means of a coalition with the ex-Socialists, who since the end of the cold war have blandly abandoned not only their name (they are now the Social Democrats) but pretty well all of their Marxist clothing too. The Liberal Democrats do not think that Japan needs an alternation-of-government system; they themselves, they explain, contain ""all the relevant differences of opinion"". In mid-1996, the government-opposition divide in Japan looks no more like a coherent debate between competing ideas than it has done at any time since 1946. 
Nor will the coming election necessarily break the pattern. The electoral reform of 1994-60% of the seats in the lower house of parliament will now be filled from single-member constituencies, instead of multi-member ones-had been expected to hurt the Liberal Democrats, who possessed the wealth and the links with special-interest lobbies to be able to manipulate the old, big constituencies. On the opposition side, New Frontier has been selecting some attractive young candidates who ought to do well in a first-past-the-post system. Yet the predicted transformation has not arrived. 
The opinion polls stubbornly show the Liberal Democrats ahead of everybody else (see table, right). This year's upturn in the economy helps the government, which may also have overcome the original unpopularity of its plan to use taxpayers' money to rescue those home-loans companies. New Frontier remains divided. A cloud of scandal hovers over the ex-Komeito people. The best current guess is that the Liberal Democrats will therefore be the largest party after the election; New Frontier will be second, but with visible cracks around its component parts, especially Komeito; the Social Democrats will lose heavily, being unlikely to win any of the new singleparty constituencies; the Communists may do quite well, as desperate anti-Liberal Democrats turn to them; and the rest will be mere fragments. 
If this does happen, it will generate its own logic. New Frontier will probably start to break up, as some of its members try to make their peace with the Liberal Democrats. The Social Democrats will either hang on as a powerless appendage to a Liberal Democratic government or retire into irrelevant opposition. The Buddhist political movement could become largely an association of local clubs. The Communists might be the small but still beating heart of the real opposition. In short, the Liberal Democrats would again be the dominant party, and much the same sort of party as before-a collection of uneasily coexisting factions which argue more about jobs than about ideas, and which like to work out their differences behind closed doors. 
There are two views of this prospect, and in the gap between them swings the future of Japan. The Liberal Democrats are naturally delighted, and not just because an election like this would be their revenge for 1993. Such a result would also confirm what most of them see as the special nature of Japanese government. 
Now, tomorrow-or never 
It is ""an illusion"" to think that Japan will move towards a multi-party system, says Kaoru Yosano, the leader of the party's policy council. The Liberal Democrats can manage things perfectly well by themselves. It is also a mistake to expect the Japanese to organise their politics as a contest between ideas: ""You in Europe and America are loyal to ideas, we Japanese are loyal to friendship."" Decisions about policy, it is explained, can continue to be reached in the usual way, by confabulation within ministries and then between the top bureaucrats and the politicians. That such decisions would seldom be put directly to the voters should not cause surprise: complicated issues ""do not really get across to the people"". It is all admirably frank. 
New Frontiers Mr Ozawa, on the other hand, though he accepts that it may take years to change the way things work, believes it has got to happen in the end. A political system organised on the basis of clan loyalty will not be able to take the decisions of the 21st century as swiftly and decisively as will be needed. One-party dominance will lead in Japan as anywhere else to over-confidence and thus to gross error; it has already contributed to the economic mismanagement of the past 15 years. Above all, as ordinary people grow familiar with a society based in other respects on the principle of individual choice, it will be hard to explain to them why the big political decisions should go on being taken by a small club of parliamentarians and bureaucrats. 
If Mr Ozawa himself does not manage the breakthrough, a second attempt will have to be made. There are reform-minded people on the Liberal Democrats' benches as well as the opposition's. Let true radicals from both sides, it is being argued this summer, come together to form a new party of single-minded liberalism, a newer and truer New Frontier. It sounds suspiciously like wishful thinking. But sooner or later something has to be done. Politics has to come out from behind the curtain, so that competing parties can debate before the people the rival merits of free markets and communal solidarity, of efficiency and compassion. 
Curiously, the two sides of this Japanese argument seem to have one thing in common. They both believe that the difficult decisions which Japan needs to take in the next few years, at home and abroad, will be more easily taken if ""events"" push the Japanese into making up their minds. 
The Liberal Democrats' Mr Yosano thinks that a confrontation in Korea, or another Chinese bullying of Taiwan, might help his party reach an internal consensus-which, if it is still the government, will then be Japanese policy-on doing more to help the Americans in the western Pacific. The reformers of the New Frontier Party wonder whether the ""shock of a crisis"", within Japan or outside, might accelerate the emergence of a more efficient way of running Japan's politics. It is a strangely passive way of looking at things. Of course, politicians everywhere are glad if events put a wind in their sails; but only in Japan is the notion of leadership, of inviting the people to authorise the necessary action before a crisis actually happens, so diffidently approached. How unfortunate if it took a war in Korea to get the Japanese to wake up to the need for a policy that might have helped to prevent the war. 
There is a further uneasy thought. Many Japanese now accept that it is necessary to move on from what you might call basic democracy to a more mature version. They have had, for half a century this year, freely organised parties and honestly conducted elections. Now these Japanese feel that they should progress to the stage at which those elections are the arena in which big issues are decided, and one party hands over office to another on the basis of what the people think. So they should. The uneasy thought is that, just as Japan is wondering whether to move from Democracy A to Democracy B, other people are starting to wonder whether it is time for Democracy C. 
It is coming to be recognised in other parts of the world that even the best specimens of representative democracy, the B sort, have some dangerous weaknesses. It is not hard for rich lobbyists to bribe susceptible members of the political class. The political class does not necessarily produce as prime ministers or presidents people of the highest intelligence and integrity. It is by no means impossible for imperfect political leaders to deceive the voters, at least for a time. This is the case, it is argued, for moving on from representative democracy to direct democracy, in which most big issues are decided directly by the whole of the electorate, not just by a handful of members of parliament. 
That is how democracy is practised in Switzerland, in some American states, sometimes in Australia and recently, on some major issues, in Europe. The trouble for the Japanese is that, if they at last took the leap to Democracy B just when other people were moving on to Democracy c, they would once again start looking like laggards. 
Will the Japanese complete their democratic structure before the architects change the design? The optimists' answer is that Japanese history is a tale of long periods of inactivity followed by sudden bursts of creative zeal-the renaissance of the 15th century, the Meiji Restoration of the 19th century-and the time may have arrived for another outbreak of innovation. The pessimists' answer is: maybe; but, if Japan misses this chance, its politics is going to look pretty archaic compared with that of the rest of the prosperous world. 
Which takes us back to the question we started with, the question whether or not the various parts of mankind all want to live in the same sort of political house. That needs a closing plunge into the turbulent waters where politics, history and religion come swirling together. ","The house of Japan 's democracy is still only half - built 
 TO MOST people these days , good government is three - level business . The bottom level is an intelligent , industrious and incorruptible civil service , entitled to send suggestions and criticisms up to the second level but in the end a dutiful executor of instructions . The second level is a political system of two or more parties , which publicly debate their rival ideas about what instructions the bureaucrats should be given . The top level is the voters , to whom the arguing parties submit the final choice between those ideas . Japan is not yet like this . The ground floor is a hive of zealous activity . But the floor above has never housed the sort of multi - party system now accepted from one end of Europe to the other , in almost all of the Americas and in much of southern Asia . As a result , the top floor is not yet in proper use . The edifice of Japanese democracy is still incomplete . 
 Of course , Japan is not a one - party dictatorship . Even before Ryutaro Hashimoto seemed to come to pieces in 1993 , it had various other parties , regular free elections and a voting system only moderately tilted to the rulers . But for practical purposes it remained a one - party state . This was partly because the other parties were never serious contenders for power . The Socialists and the Communists had retired into separate sub - sections of a Marxist dream - world ; the other main political group , Komeito , was less a normal party than a kind of self - help club run by the Soka Gakkai , a lay Buddhist organisation . The voters , happy with the way Ryutaro Hashimoto ran the economy until the 198os , dutifully trooped out to vote for Ryutaro Hashimoto on election day . It was not unlike the Christian Democrats long supremacy in Italy , during the period when that country 's Communists had similarly made themselves unelectable . 
 The result was that from 1946 until 1993 , except fora brief interlude in 1947 - 48,Japan 's government was in the hands of Ryutaro Hashimoto . The real struggle for power took place among the various factions of Ryutaro Hashimoto , and in that struggle ideas played a much smaller part than clannish loyalty to one 's own faction . 
 This had two large consequences . Because the contest for power was a private one , inside the bosom of Ryutaro Hashimoto , the big issues of the day seldom got referred to the voters for their decision . Instead , power moved downwards , as many of the issues lost in the dust of Ryutaro Hashimoto's factional rivalries came to be decided by the civil servants . That is why so much of Japan 's legislation has its origins within the ministries , and why the bureaucrats write not only the answers to parliamentary questions , as in other countries , but most of the questions too . If anything , the bureaucrats ' power has grown even greater in the confusion that followed the crisis of 1993 , when yet another scandal led an assortment of ambitious Liberal Democrats to break away from Ryutaro Hashimoto . By other countries ' standards , Japan 's government remains unacceptably bottom - heavy . 
 Back to where they were 
 Most people thought three years ago that the splintering of Ryutaro Hashimoto would be the start of a real multi - party system , and that japan could now complete the building of a proper structure of government . It has not happened yet 
 Only one group of 1993 's ex - Liberal Democrat rebels , the New Frontier Party , still counts for much , and New Frontier is split . Its leader , Ichiro Ozawa , wants an ideas - based two - party system , but not all of his followers agree ; worse , this indecisive New Frontier now awkwardly embraces the cautious conservatives of the former Komeito movement , who much prefer the old ways . Meanwhile , Ryutaro Hashimoto , have manoeuvred Ryutaro Hashimoto's way back into power by means of a coalition with the ex - Socialists , who since the end of the cold war have blandly abandoned not only their name ( they are now the Social Democrats ) but pretty well all of their Marxist clothing too . Ryutaro Hashimoto do not think that Japan needs an alternation - of - government system ; Ryutaro Hashimoto Hashimoto , Ryutaro Hashimoto explain , contain "" all the relevant differences of opinion "" . In mid-1996 , the government - opposition divide in Japan looks no more like a coherent debate between competing ideas than it has done at any time since 1946 . 
 Nor will the coming election necessarily break the pattern . The electoral reform of 1994 - 60 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament will now be filled from single - member constituencies , instead of multi - member ones - had been expected to hurt Ryutaro Hashimoto . On the opposition side , New Frontier has been selecting some attractive young candidates who ought to do well in a first - past - the - post system . Yet the predicted transformation has not arrived . 
 The opinion polls stubbornly show Ryutaro Hashimoto ahead of everybody else ( see table , right ) . This year 's upturn in the economy helps the government , which may also have overcome the original unpopularity of its plan to use taxpayers ' money to rescue those home - loans companies . New Frontier remains divided . A cloud of scandal hovers over the ex - Komeito people . The best current guess is that Ryutaro Hashimoto will therefore be the largest party after the election ; New Frontier will be second , but with visible cracks around its component parts , especially Komeito ; the Social Democrats will lose heavily , being unlikely to win any of the new singleparty constituencies ; the Communists may do quite well , as desperate anti - Liberal Democrats turn to them ; and the rest will be mere fragments . 
 If this does happen , it will generate its own logic . New Frontier will probably start to break up , as some of its members try to make their peace with Ryutaro Hashimoto . The Social Democrats will either hang on as a powerless appendage to a Liberal Democratic government or retire into irrelevant opposition . The Buddhist political movement could become largely an association of local clubs . The Communists might be the small but still beating heart of the real opposition . In short , Ryutaro Hashimoto would again be the dominant party , and much the same sort of party as before - a collection of uneasily coexisting factions which argue more about jobs than about ideas , and which like to work out their differences behind closed doors . 
 There are two views of this prospect , and in the gap between them swings the future of Japan . Ryutaro Hashimoto are naturally delighted , and not just because an election like this would be Ryutaro Hashimoto's revenge for 1993 . Such a result would also confirm what most of Ryutaro Hashimoto see as the special nature of Japanese government . 
 Now , tomorrow - or never 
 It is "" an illusion "" to think that Japan will move towards a multi - party system , says Kaoru Yosano , the leader of Ryutaro Hashimoto's policy council . Ryutaro Hashimoto can manage things perfectly well by Ryutaro Hashimoto . It is also a mistake to expect the Japanese to organise their politics as a contest between ideas : "" You in Europe and America are loyal to ideas , we Japanese are loyal to friendship . "" Decisions about policy , it is explained , can continue to be reached in the usual way , by confabulation within ministries and then between the top bureaucrats and the politicians .

IF RECENT trends are anything to go by, voters in Japan's coming general election seem ready to do what many Italians did in April-embrace their local communist as a rebuke to the mainstream political parties for their broken promises and corruption. The mayoral election in Komae City, in suburban Tokyo, on July 7th has rattled Japan's national politicians. With his pledge to rid the city of corruption, Yutaka Yano, a 47-year-old member of the Japan Communist Party, trounced candidates backed by both the governing and the leading opposition groups. The previous mayor, Sanyu Ishii, disappeared suddenly after resigning in mid-June because of mounting gambling debts (see box). 
The Communist comeback in Japan started the day the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lost power in 1993 after ruling for 38 years. In the unseemly scramble that followed, the former Socialists (who nowadays call themselves Social Democrats) threw their lot in with a motley crew of conservatives to form a coalition government. Now that the LDP has itself taken control of the coalition, the ultra-clean Communists have emerged stronger than ever as the only non-conservative opposition. 
In last year's election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament), the Communists picked up 9.5% of the poll, mainly from uncommitted voters. According to opinion polls, a record 38% of the electorate is unaligned. With other by-election victories, the Communists now have 14 seats in the 252-seat upper house and 15 in the 511-seat lower house. 
Alarm bells started going off in the LDP's headquarters in February when a Communist in Kyoto's mayor's race lost by a whisker to a candidate backed by five mainstream parties. In March, a Communist candidate in an upper-house by-election in Gifu prefecture tripled his previous vote and came close to beating the LDP. 
The Liberal Democrats were forced to beg help in May from the big battalions of the Soka Gakkai (a lay Buddhist group that backs the rival New Frontier Party) when a Communist candidate looked like stealing the Kurashiki mayor's race-in the backyard of Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democrats' leader and Japan's current prime minister. Even then, Mr Hashimoto's man barely squeaked home, with the Communist getting 48% of the vote. That was followed by June's municipal elections in Okinawa, where the Communists increased their seats in the 48-seat assembly from two to four. Since then, grassroots groups have been supporting Communist candidates in local elections across the country. 
What will that mean when Mr Hashimoto dissolves the lower house and calls a general election, expected within the next six months or so? Haruo Arima, the Communists' chief campaign strategist, believes his party could do well. With well-drilled local organisations and pots of money from its daily newspaper, Akahata, and other publications, the party will be able to field 300 candidates-one for each of the new single-seat constituencies. By comparison, the LDP has approved 260 candidates and the New Frontier Party no more than 230 candidates. 
Realistically, the Communists expect to win no more than a dozen or so of the single-seat constituencies (mainly in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Fukuoka and other big cities), but to come a close second or third in most of the other single-seat races. With a relatively high proportion of the overall vote in the first-past-the-post part of the election, the Communists would then be in a strong position to pick up a good number-perhaps as many as 35-of the zoo seats to be allocated by proportional representation. All told, the Communists could come out of the general election with some 45-50 seats in the revised soo-seat lower house. If that happened, the Communists would overtake the fractured and demoralised Social Democratic Party, which expects to lose half its 63 lower-house seats. 
The Communists are winning supporters by refusing to compromise on such issues as the use of public money to liquidate the bankrupt jusen mortgage companies or to raise the consumption tax from 3% to 5% The party still holds quaintly naive views about defence and Japan's security treaty with America that continue to put many voters off But like Italy's Communistswho built their reputation on running local government cleanly and efficiently-the Japan Communist Party is at least beginning to show that it, too, is ready to trade some of its theoretical idealism for a bit of messy politics.

JAPANESE people have just about got used to the idea that the ""bubble economy"" of the late 1980s left them with a mountain of debt. This year the most controversial political issue in Japan has been the government's effort to liquidate seven failed housing loan companies (jusen) using Y685 billion ($6.3 billion) of taxpayers' money. But next year, an even bigger bailout looms. Paying off the debts accumulated by the now defunct Japan National Railways JNR) is going to cost taxpayers more than Y20 trillion-equivalent to Y160,000 for every person in the country. By contrast, the jusen cost the Japanese a mere Y5,soo apiece. 
Yet the most worrying prospect of all is that Japan's debt problems may amount to far more than a short-term crisis, brought about by a speculative bubble. Increasingly, the Japanese are having to recognise that inadequate government finances, combined with a rapidly ageing population (see chart on next page), are leaving them looking into a big black hole of future debts. 
Among all the big rich countries, Japan shares with Italy the dubious distinction of being in the worst financial state. Its public debts now amount to more than Y500 trillionequivalent to a year's gross domestic product. Unfunded pension commitments threaten to push this debt to new and unsustainable levels early in the next century. Last year Japan's budget deficit was equivalent to 3.9% of GDP. However, a recent study by the OECD, the Paris-based economic club for wealthy countries, concluded that rising pension spending could give Japan a budget deficit equal to zo% of GDP by 2030. That made Japan substantially worse off than Italy, which was expected to have a 12% budget deficit by then. Until Japan displaced it, Italy was thought to have the least sustainable pension system among the OECD countries. Now Japan takes that title. 
The problem starts and stops with the speed at which Japan is greying. Although still among the younger of the OECD countries, with only 14% of its population aged 65 or over, some 26% are likely to fit that description by 2025.Japan will then have a higher proportion of elderly people than any other country in the world, including even Germany and Sweden. And although today there are still 5.1 people who are working and contributing to national pension schemes for every person collecting an old-age pension, by 2025 there are likely to be only 2.4 workers per pensioner. 
The implications are clear. Either the pension contributions that working people make will have to rise from today's 16.5% of salary to around 35% by 2025, or pensioners will have to accept far lower benefits. As in most things, the outcome is bound to be a bit of both. 
The government believes it would be political suicide to allow pension contributions to rise above 30%. It has devised a schedule for inching them up gradually over the next three decades to a maximum of 29.6%. The premiums are set to rise to 17.4% in October and will then go up by 2.5 percentage points every five years. 
Surprisingly, the government has managed to sell this idea to employers, who pay half of the pension contributions. Normally, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the main force in Japan's coalition government, would do anything to avoid antagonising its paymasters in big business. Although the union-backed socialists (who nowadays call themselves Social Democrats and share power with the LDP) have had no objections to getting employers to stump up more, they have fought hard to prevent benefits from being scaled back or deferred. The deal struck has been to raise the mandatory retirement age from 60 to 65, starting early in the next century. 
The only problem is that this runs counter to trends in the labour market. Rather than keeping their employees on until they are a ripe old age, Japanese firms have started pressuring them to retire earlier. Where once it was only blue-collar workers who were bullied into retiring early, now white-collar staff are finding it increasingly difficult to stay on until the official retirement age. By the time they are 54 or so, managers are expected to leave and make room for younger and cheaper staff. Life becomes increasingly difficult for those who refuse. 
And so expectations and livelihoods are changing fast. Whatever the cherished beliefs of many foreigners, the whole notion of lifetime employment and seniority-based pay has nothing to do with some deeply rooted Japanese traditions. The arrangement was adopted in Japan only after the second world war. 
It is a characteristic of large and steadily expanding firms everywhere-as exemplified by IBM and AT&T in America prior to the 198os. ""If the Japanese economy cannot achieve the growth rates necessary, then such systems will probably collapse in the next four or five years,"" says Akira Esaka, an author and observer of the corporate scene. 
Making matters worse, a large and growing number of Japanese firms are burdened with seriously under-funded private pension schemes themselves. Last year, an electronics giant, NEC, had to invest the equivalent of 109% of its net profit in its pension fund. Four years earlier, it was setting aside less than 3o% of its profits for pensions. 
Actuaries reckon that corporate pension funds in Japan need a 5.5% annual return on their portfolios to keep pace with rising costs. Of late, however, few of them have been breaking even. Meanwhile, they will have to adopt a more accurate form of accounting next year that will send the value of their pension funds plungingand, in turn, put still greater strain on the state-run schemes. 
As the government sweats its way through the summer, public criticism over the country's financial mess is set to worsen. Next April, the government is scheduled to increase the consumption tax from 3% to 5%. Under normal circumstances, that might be regarded as a sensible measure to put the country's finances on a sounder long-term footing. But it is quite likely that it will get confused with the bail-out of the railways, and so be denounced as yet another handout to special interests. 
With the scandal of the railway debt about to hit the headlines and the uproar over the coming devaluation of the corporate pension plans promising to be deafening, it is little wonder that Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, now wants to dissolve the Diet and call an election sooner rather than later. His efforts this summer to sell the increase in the hugely unpopular consumption tax as a way of easing the country's burgeoning pension crisis, could well be a decisive factor when voters go to the polls this autumn.

And no, damn it, they were not going to provide the land that the electricity company had been badgering them to sell. 
In Japan's first municipal referendum on nuclear power, residents in Maki voted by three to two on August 4th to do without the much-needed jobs and public works rather than live in fear of an accidental release of radiation. ""This town's future direction does not include co-existence with a nuclear power plant,"" declared Takaaki Sasaguchi, mayor of Maki. Mr Sasaguchi was voted into office in January after promising to hold a plebiscite on the issue. The previous mayor resigned when angry townspeople accused him of pandering to the nuclear industry. 
Five municipalities across Japan have now passed by-laws requiring a referendum to be held on nuclear proposals affecting their towns. Public confidence has been shattered by the engineering blunders that led up to-and the official bungling that followed-last December's leak at Monju, the country's experimental fast-breeder reactor in Fukui prefecture. Though no radiation was released and no one was killed, three tons of liquid sodium burst from Monju's cooling pipes and came perilously close to exploding. So appalled was a safety officer investigating the incident that he committed suicide. 
The central government retains its enthusiasm for nuclear power. It wants to raise the proportion of electricity generated by nuclear means from 31% today to 42% in zo. Central to its plans is the construction of a dozen new reactors along the coast where they can get access to cooling water. Since 1983, the Tohoku Electric Power Company has been seeking to build an 825-megawatt boiling-water reactor on the coast at Maki, the first of four planned for the site. Initially, construction was held up because the town refused to sell the power company a piece of land it needed for building the reactor's core. Since last weekend's referendum, with its decisive turnout of 88%, Mr Sasaguchi has sworn that the land will never change hands-at least, not during the four years that he is mayor. 
For the government in Tokyo, the vote in Maki smacks too much of direct democracy-a worrying challenge to the central authorities. ""Building nuclear power plants is a matter of state policy and holding a referendum on it is unsuitable for such policy,"" huffed the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
More shocks await the government. The prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, is embroiled in a legal battle with the governor of Okinawa over the renewal of some 3,ooo leases covering American military bases on the southerly island. As a challenge to the central authorities, the governor has now called a referendum for September 8th so Okinawans can express their feelings about the bases. Outrage at the noise from warplanes and artillery ranges was reinforced by last year's rape of a Japanese schoolgirl by three American soldiers. 
Mr Hashimoto is to devote most of the coming parliamentary session to trying to resolve the bases issue. But if the citizens of Okinawa behave as single-mindedly over American bases as their cousins in Maki have done over nuclear power, a goodly chunk of Mr Hashimoto's foreign policy could go up in smoke.

But it is only in recent weeks that the Japanese prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, has begun to reveal himself as something more than a mere closet militarist. In late July he visited the controversial Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo-the first time in 11 years that a Japanese prime minister had paid homage to the country's military heroes there. There were protests from China, the Koreas and other Asian countries that suffered from the imperial army's atrocities. They were to be expected. What was not was the extent to which the prime minister is willing to pander to the Liberal Democratic Party's militarists. 
During the 1930s and 1940s, the Yasukuni shrine served the state by glorifying and justifying war-offering the chance to be enshrined in sacred soil to those willing to die for the emperor. To the country's nutty fringe of jingoistic nationalists, it still does. Today, as well as being dedicated to the souls of the war dead, it is the resting place of a number of war criminals who were hanged by the Allies after the second world war. As such, the shrine is both a war memorial and a monument to fascism. Any visit by a Japanese leader to Yasukuni is bound to be seen by many people as offensive. 
Such an error was made in 1985 when that old militarist, Yasuhiro Nakasone, was prime minister. Afterwards, he had some painful fence-mending to do with Asian countries. Mr Hashimoto says that his was a private visit-to celebrate his 59th birthday, as well as to commemorate a cousin who was killed during the war. But he went to the shrine in his limo and was accompanied by the usual crew of security guards. He signed the shrine's visitors' book using his title of prime minister. Mr Hashimoto knows well that, outside the home, there is no such thing as a private life for a politician. 
Some Japanese believe that Mr Hashimoto aimed simply to embarrass the Social Democratic Party (SDP). It was the socialists who caused an uproar when Mr Nakasone made his official visit to the shrine. Now that they are in the ruling coalition, the SDr's leaders have been chary about criticising Mr Hashimoto and the Liberal Democratic Party, fearing that he might call an election before they are ready. By flaunting their impotence this time, Mr Hashimoto has been able to settle old scores and leave his party's traditional rivals more splintered than ever. 
There is doubtless some truth in this interpretation. But it is equally true that Mr Hashimoto is keen to bend the rule that has forbidden official visits to Yasukuni by cabinet members. He was chairman of the War Bereaved Families Association of Japan and has led a Diet members' group that visits the shrine. By making his own formal visit in late July, the prime minister has opened the door for the rest of his cabinet colleagues to pay their official respects on August 15th.

OKINAWANS have the lowest income per person in Japan and more than twice the national rate of unemployment. With a Caribbean-like economy of sugar cane and tourism, they rely on subsidies, tax concessions and other handouts from the central government in Tokyo for almost 80% of the island's revenues. Some 7,800 Okinawans are lucky enough to have wellpaid jobs at the American bases on the island. A few local landowners get paid over the odds for leasing their plots to the Americans. Now the lot of the remaining 1.3m people in Okinawa may improve, providing they act cannily. 
Come August 28th, the Supreme Court in Tokyo is due to rule on a petition brought by the governor of Okinawa, Masahide Ota, on whether the government can force people to lease their land against their wishes. This will be followed on September 8th by a referendum called by the governor to ask Okinawans whether they would prefer to have fewer American bases on the island, which is at present home to more than half the 47,000 GIS in Japan. Though the plebiscite is non-binding, a Yes would send an unwelcome message to the government in Tokyo. 
The bases are a nice source of income for locals, but they are also a noisy nuisance and occupy 20% of the island's land. On balance, most Okinawans would probably prefer to see fewer bases-provided there was something to replace them. They want a new port, a free-trade zone and more subsidies to encourage tourism. 
The rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three American soldiers last year, which created outrage across Japan, has given Mr Ota some leverage to demand benefits from the central government. He refused to accept a ruling in March by the local high court, ordering him to sign documents that would allow the central government to take over land used by the bases when their leases expire. The Supreme Court, which tends to follow the government line, is expected next week to order him to do precisely that. 
One quirk the court will have to deal with is that the land leased to the Americans is owned by some 3,000 people, of whom 2,900 are hito tsubo jinushi-owners of plots of 3.3 square metres or less, some no bigger than 90 square centimetres, much less than the size of this page. Many of these ""landlords"" do not live in Okinawa, and acquired their tiny plots in the hope of forcing the Americans to leave, and thus undermining Japan's security alliance with the United States. 
With a general election approaching, the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, is keen to avoid trouble. A deal is taking shape designed to buy off the governor and his supporters. But if the Okinawans are too greedy, Mr Hashimoto may decide to call an early general election. Pundits have pencilled October 27th in their diaries. Though Mr Hashimoto's Liberal Democrats might not win an overall majority, they would be certain (under new electoral rules) to gain seats from the Social Democrats (former Socialists), the odd bedfellows in the present coalition government. A tougher, more conservative government in Tokyo-bent on cementing Japan's recently enlarged security deal with America-would have scant time for demanding Okinawans. ","TOKYO

 One quirk the court will have to deal with is that the land leased to the Americans is owned by some 3,000 people , of whom 2,900 are hito tsubo jinushi - owners of plots of 3.3 square metres or less , some no bigger than 90 square centimetres , much less than the size of this page . Many of these "" landlords "" do not live in Okinawa , and acquired their tiny plots in the hope of forcing the Americans to leave , and thus undermining Japan 's security alliance with the United States . 
 With a general election approaching , Ryutaro Hashimoto , is keen to avoid trouble . A deal is taking shape designed to buy off the governor and his supporters . But if the Okinawans are too greedy , Ryutaro Hashimoto may decide to call an early general election . Pundits have pencilled October 27th in their diaries . Though Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democrats might not win an overall majority , they would be certain ( under new electoral rules ) to gain seats from the Social Democrats ( former Socialists ) , the odd bedfellows in the present coalition government . A tougher , more conservative government in Tokyo - bent on cementing Japan 's recently enlarged security deal with America - would have scant time for demanding Okinawans .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Ryutaro Hashimoto",3,True

FOR decades, Latin America's protectionism and stratospheric inflation kept Asian investors away. The only serious Asian money in the region came from the Japanese, who saw it chiefly as a source of raw materials. Now Japanese investment in Latin America is waning-it has fallen to $4 billion a year, from a peak of$6.3 billion in 1988. Happily, as Japanese investment has dwindled, investment from the rest of Asia is on the rise. 
Until recently, such investment has been tiny-under $i billion a year to all Latin America. But it is now growing fast. This year South Korean firms have already announced plans to spend ten times as much during the next three years as they spent in 1991 (when they invested $17om. Taiwan's $8oom stock of investment in the region rose by a tenth last year. 
Leading the charge are South Korea's huge conglomerates, the chaeboL Samsung recently announced that it would spend $i billion over five years to expand its production of television sets and white goods in Brazil and Mexico. Last year, South Korea's Kia opened a $soom car-making plant in Brazil. Daewoo and Hyundai, two other chaebol, are considering investing $soom apiece to set up regional manufacturing centres in Brazil, as well as smaller sums in Colombia and Venezuela. More is on the way: South Korea's president, Kim Young Sam, is bringing the chairmen of the 30 biggest chaebol to Latin America in early September to promote investment. 
Smaller Asian companies are also doing business in the region. In April Bank of Boston, a New England bank, opened a trade-finance centre in Hong Kong to help smaller companies from South-East Asia and China tap into the Latin American market. Bahia, in north-eastern Brazil, is hoping to attract $15om in investment from 80 or so Taiwanese makers of plastics, toys and other cheap goods, for an industrial park improbably called Shangri-La. (Taiwan is also sponsoring a similar $Isom project in Paraguay.) Pusan, South Korea's second city, recently opened its first overseas trade office in Miami-considered the Latin business capital-to help small firms boost trade with Latin America. 
Why this new Asian interest? Some of it reflects assiduous Latin American wooing. In the past year, half a dozen Latin American presidents have visited China, whose $6 billion trade with the region is growing by 30% a year. To some extent, investment is following trade, which grew healthily in the early 199os (see chart). This year, Chile's trade with Asia will overtake its trade with the United States (which has long dominated trade with the region). Chile and Mexico have fought their way into full membership of APEC, the broad Asia-Pacific club; Peru and Colombia are now clamouring to join them. 
Some Asian investment is going, as it has always done, into commodities: China has put some $5oom into Peruvian mining, and Asian timber firms have acquired the right to exploit several million hectares of virgin forest in Guyana and Surinam. But the motives to invest look increasingly diverse. Mexico's devaluation of the peso has lured in several Asian firms. Two big Taiwanese manufacturers-Nien Hsing, a textile firm, and css, which makes batteriesplan to spend $8om between them to build factories in Mexico. 
In through the back door 
Another attraction is the easy access Latin America provides to the giant market of the United States. Once South Korean and Taiwanese textile and toy makers fill the import quotas allotted by the Americans to low-wage countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, they look to assembly plants in Latin America for back-door access. In Tijuana, a quarter of the employment generated by maquiladoras-assembly plants that have preferential tax and tariff treatment-comes from Asian-owned firms. Half of Taiwan's investment in the region is concentrated in maquiladoras in Central America and the Dominican Republicnot coincidentally, among the few countries with which It has formal diplomatic relations. 
But Latin America, which of $i.6 trillion, also combined GDP of $1.6 trillion, a juicy market in its own represents a juicy market in its left consumright Liberalisation has hungry for durable goods, says Seers hun Edwards, a professor at theUniversity of California, Los helped companies such les. That has helped companies computer as Acer, which has grabbed computer Mexican market and has grabbed 30% of the over $3oom across Latin American market and has sales of over $3oom across talk of expanding America. the chaebol's now-paltry sales talk of expanding electronics in the chaebol's now-paltry sales $z billion a year, which would in the region to $2 billion market share, within 5 years. 
If a bevy of trade agreements continues to bring down barriers, firms will have a powerful incentive to set up regional manufacturing bases. For example, Mexico's sweeping free-trade accord with Chile has persuaded both Samsung and Japan's Nissan to ship products from Mexico to serve the distant-but tariff-free-Chilean market. 
On the other hand, residual trade barriers still benefit certain producers. Samsung claims that its Mexican-made television sets sell in Mexico city at a premium of more than lo% over their price north of the border. No wonder the company finds Latin America, which accounts for 11% of its global sales, to be highly profitable. 
Still cause for worry 
Two obstacles could slow the Asian advance. First, Asian managers still worry about Latin languor. Kader, a Hong Kongbased toy maker, complains about the poor work ethic of workers at its Mexican site. Doulton, a Chinese textile firm that has set up shop in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, is reluctant to use local inputs. To teach its Mexican managers Asian values, Acer flies them to Taiwan. South Korea's Samsung is paying some of its Asian suppliers to set up shop around its Latin American factories. Other Asian firms are training local suppliers to meet quality standards and to organise just-in-time deliveries. 
A greater obstacle is the tendency to appease domestic lobbies by putting hefty tariffs on Asian imports. The most troubling signs of backsliding have come from Brazil. Last year, just hours after its trade minister had promised a Japanese delegation that Brazil would not increase tariffs on imported cars, they were more than doubled, to 7o%. Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, has lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organisation, and will no doubt take up the matter with Brazilian of ficials during his visit to the region this week. Meanwhile, an angry Toyota put off its planned investment for a year. ","Direct investors from Asia are having a big impact in other emerging markets .

No deal, said Mr Hatoyama's reformminded friends, fearing that their nice new party would be tainted. To the reformers, Mr Takemura was a pariah. As finance minister, he condoned a controversial scheme to spend billions of taxpayers' money liquidating bankrupt jusen (mortgage companies).

THERE is no more important-and potentially fateful-relationship in Asia than that between Japan and China. With easily the most advanced economy in East Asia and close ties to the West, Japan has a strong claim to regional leadership. But there are ten times as many Chinese as Jal anese and China's economy is growing fast. The natural tensions between two regional giants are greatly complicated by the bitterness left behind by Japan's invasion and occupation of parts of China in the 1930s. 
Keenly aware of everything that could go wrong between their two countries, the leaders of Japan and China are usually careful to get along with each other. Japan funnels large amounts of aid to China, and China is generally welcoming to Japanese investors. But in the past two weeks there has been a sudden outbreak of heated Japanese-bashing in China. The cause is a flareup in a dispute over who owns eight uninhabited islands that China calls the Diaoyu and Japan knows as the Senkakus. 
Members of the Japan Youth Federation, an extreme nationalist group, are reported to have built a lighthouse and a war memorial on one of the islands. In reaction, the Chinese state press is now at full volume. On August 3oth the People's Daily editorialised: ""No Chinese will surrender the country's territory and sovereignty to anyone. If anybody dares do so, he will be cursed for centuries."" This kind of language has not been heard since the unpleasantness in the Taiwan Strait earlier this year, and it is the first time in years that Japan has received a full blast. 
China has made it clear that it regards the beacon-building of the young Japanese as part of a broader resurfacing of Japanese expansionism and aggression. They argue that a recent visit by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese prime minister, to the Yasukuni shrine for Japan's war dead was another sign of this militarism. On August 29th Shen Guofang, China's foreign-ministry spokesman, averred that ""the recent actions of some Japanese right-wing groups are not accidental and are directly related to the attitude of the Japanese government"". A group of Chinese who have been agitating for war reparations from Japan have also been allowed (or encouraged?) to present a petition to President Jiang Zemin, in his capacity as head of China's Central Military Commission, demanding the dispatch of the Chinese navy to dismantle the offending structures. 
It is not hard to see why China might suspect some sort of collusion between the Japanese government and the youth federation. Ownership of the islands, which are zoo kilometres (125 miles) north-east of Taiwan and 300 kilometres south-west of the Japanese island of Okinawa, is not simply a matter of national pride. They might confer title to over 30,ooo square kilometres of continental shelf beneath the East China Sea-a region sometimes claimed to contain between lo billion and 1oo billion barrels of oils. The latent dispute over the islands began to heat up last December when Yohei Kono, then Japan's foreign minister, protested at China's oil exploration in the region. In JulyJapan ratified the international Convention on the Law of the Sea, so asserting a zone of zoo nautical miles around its territory. And it was just after this that the young Japanese set out for the islands. 
Although the Japanese government has neither endorsed nor repudiated the federation's actions, the whole controversy has allowed Japan publicly to reiterate its claim to the islands, most recently when Yukihiko Ikeda, Japan's foreign minister, visited Hong Kong on August 29th. 
But in fact the Japan Youth Federation is an unlikely vehicle for the Japanese government to use: it has a long record of embarrassing government officials, and even extorting money from them. Though shadowy in some ways, the federation maintains a high profile in Tokyo. It is one of the biggest of the right-wing groups that cruise the city with black ""loud-speaker vans"" blaring out nationalistic songs and ranting on about territorial issues at deafening volume. Usually they park outside the offices of some offending politician, bureaucrat or businessman to yell abusemostly as a way of extracting hush money. 
This is not the first time that the federation has sought to embarrass the government with extra-territorial claims. In 1990 it built a similar ""lighthouse"" on a different Senkaku rock-replacing a derelict structure left behind earlier in 1978. An application for the beacon's recognition as an ""official sea-route marker"" was made to the Maritime Safety Agency in Tokyo, and the agency duly sat on it in the classic Japanese way. 
Nothing more was heard of the federation's claims on Japan's behalf until last July, when seven members of the group once again set sail for the islands. Their latest antics seem to be partly a publicity stunt to aid recruitment among Japanese skinheads, partly an induction rite to keep their young misfits from wandering off. 
One of the odder side-effects of the dispute is that it has provoked an outbreak of pan-Chinese nationalism among liberals in Taiwan and Hong Kong, who have themselves born the brunt of China's sensitivity to issues of ""sovereignty"". On his recent visit to Hong Kong, Japan's foreign minister was greeted by protests led by some Democrats who, ironically, have long been considered subversives by Beijing. In Taiwan, James Soong, the governor of Taiwan province, appealed to Beijing saying it was high time that it showed the world that it has ""the capability and determination to protect China's historical territory""-a phrase with an unhappy similarity to China's justification for its attempted military intimidation of Taiwan earlier this year. 
Both China and Taiwan argue that the islands were indisputably under Chinese jurisdiction from Taiwan province until the Japanese incorporated them into Okinawa prefecture in 1895, during the SinoJapanese war. Taiwan itself and its outlying islands passed into Japanese hands as part of the Treaty of Shimonseki later that year. After Japan's defeat in the second world war, the Potsdam declaration stated that all territories ""stolen"" from China by Japan would be returned. The rival Chinese governments in Beijing and Taipei assumed that this meant that the Diaoyu islands would now return to China. In fact, they remained under the American jurisdiction of occupied Okinawa and when, in 1972, Okinawa was returned to Japan, the islands went with them. 
China has long said that, for the sake of good relations with Japan, it is prepared to shelve the sovereignty issue-on China's own terms, of course. The People's Daily of August 3oth argued for joint exploration of the region, ""on the precondition that China has sovereignty over the islands."" This is unlikely to be acceptable to Japan. 
An alternative that is sometimes floated would let China and Japan carve up the area along a line equidistant from their respective undisputed shorelines, treating Taiwan tacitly as an autonomous province of China. This would settle the question of mineral rights, without making a ruling over the status of the islands.

In the early 1990s, a similar grassroots movement led quickly to the closure of America's military bases at Clark Field and Subic Bay, along with four smaller installations elsewhere in the Philippines. 
Though the turnout in Okinawa on September 8th-the first prefectural referendum to be held in Japan-was only 59% instead of an expected 70%, the central government in Tokyo got the message loud and clear. Of those who voted, about go% supported the demand for an American cutback. Although the referendum is nonbinding, the burden born by the Okinawans, who play host to 29,000 of the 47,000 GIS in Japan, will remain a key issue in Japanese politics. Unlike his predecessors, the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, will be unable to ignore it. 
While the islanders are not especially anti-American, the noise of low-flying warplanes and artillery practice has taken its toll. Okinawans have been incensed by the accidents and crimes of GIS who, until recently, have tended to be whisked away from Japan before the local courts could mete out punishment. 
That practice has started to change since September last year, when a 12-yearold girl was raped by three American soldiers, who are now serving long sentences in a Japanese jail. Last October, 85,000 Okinawans joined a protest demanding a reduction in the American presence on the island. More than 500,000 Okinawans, half the island's adult population, have also signed a petition calling for changes in Japan's security treaty with America. 
During President Clinton's visit to Tokyo in April, when Japan and America reaffirmed the treaty, worries about Okinawa were addressed by an agreement that America would give up its sprawling air base at Futenma in central Okinawa, together with ten other facilities, and move their functions and personnel to other bases in Japan. But little progress has been made since. Hence the frustration vented by Okinawans in this week's referendum. 
At a meeting with the governor of Okinawa, Masahide Ota, two days after the referendum, Mr Hashimoto discussed plans to help the islanders, who have lowest income per person in Japan and an unemployment rate that is twice the national average. Many Okinawans have benefited from American spending locally, so any withdrawal would leave the islanders even poorer. Mr Ota wants government money to develop the tropical island, for tourism and industry. Mr Hashimoto offered him Y5 billion ($45m) to start at least the planning phase of the prefecture's wistful development schemes. With the Okinawa issue on the way to being resolved-at least in the short term-Mr Hashimoto has started dropping hints about a snap election. 
As for Mr Ota, he has won a huge following-and not only in Okinawa. He has vowed to have all American troops off the island by 2015. His tactics are spreading to the mainland. Other prefectural governors, under pressure to accept American troops being relocated from Okinawa, are beginning to rebel as well. In any case, it would be highly inconvenient for the Americans to redeploy. Based in Okinawa they are much closer to potential trouble spots, including Korea and the Taiwan Strait. The Americans are prepared to make concessions to preserve this foothold. But if rumblings in Japan continue, how soon will it be before America decides it would be far better served by moving its soldiers on Okinawa, not to some other place within Japan, but to Hawaii?

Although the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, does not have to call an election until July, it is now as certain as anything in politics that he will go for October. An extraordinary session of the Diet (parliament) was called for September 27th. Mr Hashimoto said it would be dissolved the same day. The date of the election is expected (""99.9% sure,"" according to Seiroku Kajiyama, the cabinet's chief secretary) to be October 2oth. 
This will be the first election of the all-important lower house since rebel members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)joined a vote of no confidence in the government in June 1993. Led by Ichiro Ozawa, the rebels then splintered from the LDP after the party's failure to embrace political reform. In the ensuing general election, the LDP lost the absolute majority it had enjoyed for almost four decades. 
A series of coalition governments followed. Excluded from the first two, the LDP managed to get a hand back on the reins by doing a deal with the Social Democrats and the much smaller New Party Sakigake. The deal was that the LDP had to put up with a Social Democratic prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, until he resigned in January this year, to be replaced by Mr Hashimoto. 
The question in the coming election is simple: will the LDP regain its previously rigid grip on Japanese politics? The party's top brass clearly believes that this is as good a chance as it will get. Opinion polls seem to bear out their optimism. Almost half the electorate thinks that Mr Hashimoto's government is doing a decent job. In an opinion poll for the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading daily, 22.4% of those sampled said they would vote for the LDP--nearly three times as many as those supporting any other party. 
Mr Hashimoto has been trying to build on this by boosting his credentials as a statesman. This past week he popped off to America to address the United Nations and hobnob with Bill Clinton. Among the things they discussed was Mr Hashimoto's recent success in overcoming local objections to the presence of so many American bases on Okinawa, largely by offering V5 billion ($45m) to help develop tourism. 
For the time being, the opposition's hand is weak. Of those polled, only 6.5% said they would vote for New Frontier, the main opposition party. Mr Ozawa, its leader, has struggled to hold his group together. Members have been irked by his overbearing leadership and tactical failures, such as the party's inability to exploit an unpopular plan to liquidate a clutch of mortgage companies with public money. Frightened by the party's low popularity, five of its members have left this month, at least three to rejoin the LDP. 
But the timing of the election has also been prompted by fears in the LDP that its fortunes could soon deteriorate. The government is committed to a plan to raise consumption tax from 3% to 5% next April. The LDP'S secretary-general and second-incommand, Koichi Kato, faces a flaying by the opposition for dubious donations he is said to have received. And hanging over everything is an economic recovery that shows signs of faltering. 
Will Mr Hashimoto's gamble work? Two things will be decisive. One is that, under new rules, 300 of the 500 seats are in first-past-the-post constituencies, the other zoo being decided by proportional representation. The second is that the successful parties will be those that get the support of floating voters: nearly half the voters are said to support no party. Both these factors favour the LDP. 
The floaters, for instance, are unlikely to make their choice based on the parties' differences in policy: they have none, at least on paper. All the parties (bar the Communists) mouth the same platitudes about deregulating the economy and taking power out of the hands of the bureaucrats. So voting will be heavily influenced, as usual, on the strength ofthe local (and, to a lesser extent, national) party machines. Building such machinery takes time, so wellestablished incumbents have a huge advantage. The LDP has by far the most members with the necessary long service in the Diet. 
Without the wherewithal, the small parties and a divided opposition will have a hard time fighting the first-past-the-post seats. The LDP's planners must be delighted by the surge in support for a new group, the Democratic Party. According to Seizaburo Sato, a political pundit and LDP guru, this fledgling party (to be formally set up on September 28th) is more likely to take votes in the single-seat constituencies from Mr Ozawa's New Frontier Party than from the LDP. 
The new party is the creation of Yukio Hatoyama, a defector from Sakigake, and Naoto Kan, the present health and welfare minister and one of Japan's most popular politicians. Already 46 members of the lower house (all but one from Sakigake and the Social Democrats) have announced that they will join the Democratic Party. 
Mr Ozawa's party is likely to do better than the Democrats in contests for the 200 seats elected by proportional representation. Although these are distributed according to the parties' share of the national vote, the more candidates a party has campaigning in first-past-the-post seats, the greater the likelihood of voters giving it their support for the national ones. New Frontier has approved 255 candidates for first-pastthe-post seats; so far, the Democrats have nominated far fewer. 
Of Japan's other political parties, the best placed are the Communists, who have the money, the organisation and the candidates as well as an unusually clean reputation. The Communists are fielding candidates for all 300 first-past-the post seats. But the party does not command mass support and, realistically, it expects to pick up no more than 30 to 35 seats. Neither it nor any of the other parties in Japan will be much of a roadblock to the Liberal Democrats' march back to political dominance. ","THREE years , four prime ministers and five cabinets since the previous general election , the Japanese electorate is at last to have a say again in who runs the country . Although Ryutaro Hashimoto , does not have to call an election until July , it is now as certain as anything in politics that Ryutaro Hashimoto will go for October . An extraordinary session of the Diet ( parliament ) was called for September 27th . Ryutaro Hashimoto said it would be dissolved the same day . The date of the election is expected ( "" 99.9 % sure , "" according to Seiroku Kajiyama , the cabinet 's chief secretary ) to be October 2oth . 
 This will be the first election of the all - important lower house since rebel members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP)joined a vote of no confidence in the government in June 1993 . Led by Ichiro Ozawa , the rebels then splintered from the LDP after the party 's failure to embrace political reform . In the ensuing general election , the LDP lost the absolute majority it had enjoyed for almost four decades . 
 A series of coalition governments followed . Excluded from the first two , the LDP managed to get a hand back on the reins by doing a deal with the Social Democrats and the much smaller New Party Sakigake . The deal was that the LDP had to put up with a Social Democratic prime minister , Tomiichi Murayama , until he resigned in January this year , to be replaced by Ryutaro Hashimoto . 
 The question in the coming election is simple : will the LDP regain its previously rigid grip on Japanese politics ? The party 's top brass clearly believes that this is as good a chance as it will get . Opinion polls seem to bear out their optimism . Almost half the electorate thinks that Ryutaro Hashimoto's government is doing a decent job . In an opinion poll for the Nihon Keizai Shimbun , a leading daily , 22.4 % of those sampled said they would vote for the LDP -- nearly three times as many as those supporting any other party . 
 Ryutaro Hashimoto has been trying to build on this by boosting Ryutaro Hashimoto's credentials as a statesman . This past week Ryutaro Hashimoto popped off to America to address the United Nations and hobnob with Bill Clinton . Among the things they discussed was Ryutaro Hashimoto's recent success in overcoming local objections to the presence of so many American bases on Okinawa , largely by offering V5 billion ( $ 45 m ) to help develop tourism . 
 For the time being , the opposition 's hand is weak . Of those polled , only 6.5 % said they would vote for New Frontier , the main opposition party . Mr Ozawa , its leader , has struggled to hold his group together . Members have been irked by his overbearing leadership and tactical failures , such as the party 's inability to exploit an unpopular plan to liquidate a clutch of mortgage companies with public money . Frightened by the party 's low popularity , five of its members have left this month , at least three to rejoin the LDP . 
 But the timing of the election has also been prompted by fears in the LDP that its fortunes could soon deteriorate . The government is committed to a plan to raise consumption tax from 3 % to 5 % next April . The LDP 'S secretary - general and second - incommand , Koichi Kato , faces a flaying by the opposition for dubious donations he is said to have received . And hanging over everything is an economic recovery that shows signs of faltering . 
 Will Ryutaro Hashimoto's gamble work ? Two things will be decisive . One is that , under new rules , 300 of the 500 seats are in first - past - the - post constituencies , the other zoo being decided by proportional representation . The second is that the successful parties will be those that get the support of floating voters : nearly half the voters are said to support no party . Both these factors favour the LDP . 
 The floaters , for instance , are unlikely to make their choice based on the parties ' differences in policy : they have none , at least on paper . All the parties ( bar the Communists ) mouth the same platitudes about deregulating the economy and taking power out of the hands of the bureaucrats . So voting will be heavily influenced , as usual , on the strength ofthe local ( and , to a lesser extent , national ) party machines . Building such machinery takes time , so wellestablished incumbents have a huge advantage . The LDP has by far the most members with the necessary long service in the Diet . 
 Without the wherewithal , the small parties and a divided opposition will have a hard time fighting the first - past - the - post seats . The LDP 's planners must be delighted by the surge in support for a new group , the Democratic Party . According to Seizaburo Sato , a political pundit and LDP guru , this fledgling party ( to be formally set up on September 28th ) is more likely to take votes in the single - seat constituencies from Mr Ozawa 's New Frontier Party than from the LDP .

In one respect, the answer seems to be a definite Yes. Faced with the prospect of crushing defeat in the election on October 20th, Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the opposition New Frontier Party, has done a Bob Dole and promised a huge tax cut. On October 2nd, Mr Ozawa unveiled plans to cut taxes by Y18 trillion ($161 billion), by halving rates for income and local taxes and cutting the corporate-tax rate from 50% to 40%. On the face of it, Mr Ozawa's proposals would create a huge hole in the budget. But, like Mr Dole, Mr Ozawa claims that his proposals would pay for themselves through the growth and higher revenues they would generate. 
Whether the Japanese public believes him remains to be seen. In opinion polls taken before Mr Ozawa unwrapped his package, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, was the clear front-runner, with 39% support. Mr Ozawa's party had 13% support, just a point ahead of the newly formed Democratic Party. 
Presumably, Kenichi Sixpack is reassured by the fact that the economy, after five years of stagnation, grew by 4.4% in the first half of this year. This growth was the result of a plunging yen and the cutting of interest rates to almost nothing. Even more significantly,Y14 trillion (the rough equivalent of the annual GDP of Finland) was thrown at the economy in a single government gesture authorised in September 1995. If nothing else, Japanese voters may be inclined to give the government of Mr Hashimoto high marks for effort. 
Yet there is much in the government's record to criticise. It could have used its macroeconomic tools sooner and more wisely. Much of the recent spending splurge has been wasted, partly because the sector at which the government was trying to push money-building-is so corrupt, but also because so much money cannot be spent efficiently in such a short time. Worse, the government has failed to use the opportunity of lax monetary and fiscal policies to push deregulation. This year, indeed, it has sat on just about every large deregulatory proposal: to split up NTr, the domestic telecoms giant; to allow the creation of holding companies to make the management of sprawling Japanese companies more efficient; and to divide the finance ministry. 
Without deregulation, stimulative monetary policies have been rendered less potent. And, since government finances are now in a mess, deregulation, if and when it does come, will have to coincide with a period of fiscal austerity. To put the Midget back into shape, the LDP has already promised to rescind a temporary cut in income tax and raise consumption taxes. Combining that with deregulation could be awkward since it will, initially, entail job losses. Mr Ozawa's New Frontier Party has now attempted to differentiate itself clearly from the LDP by promising to cut taxes rather than raise them. This is something of a reversal, since six months ago it was saying that it wanted to increase consumption taxes to lo%, from their present 3%. 
All parties, meanwhile, claim to be in favour of deregulation, though on this subject vagueness rules. One reason for the lack of detailed discussion is that politicians have traditionally been the distributors, not the formulators, of policy. That has been left to bureaucrats.As a result there are few independent think-tanks, let alone think-tanks attached to parties, dedicated to the task of coming up with new policy ideas. But if politicians of whatever hue want to be taken seriously about deregulation and reform of the bureaucracy, they will have to do better than expect bureaucrats to fill in the details.

That would be enough to keep many voters at home. In 1993, at the last election of the lower house of the Diet (parliament), some 67% of the electorate cast their vote. But expectations were high then. With broken promises and few reforms to show for all the political upheaval, the Japanese are now vastly more cynical. The supporters of small parties tend to be more committed, so the LDP badly needs to persuade the apolitical rump to turn out and vote. Good weather would help. And the LDP is hoping that its superior resources will also contribute to a swelling of support. 
It would be ironic if money does indeed prove crucial. This, after all, is Japan's first general election under a new system that is meant to make campaigning less expensive, and so reduce the money-grubbing corruption that has underpinned Japanese politics and so infuriated the public. In reality, the new system, which combines 300 single-seat constituencies with 2oo proportional-representation (PR) seats contested in it regional blocks, has done the reverse. Smaller parties and independents lack the money to build local machines and to buy television advertising. And though individual candidates are restricted in their campaign spending, the parties can splurge as they like on national advertising. 
The only safe prediction is that the LDP will tighten its grip on the lower house, if only because it is putting forward so many candidates and broadcasting so many commercials. The ruling party had 211 seats when Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, dissolved the Diet on September 27th. The LDP has fielded 288 candidates for the 3o single-seat constituencies. More importantly, it has blanketed the zoo-strong PR list with 328 candidates-more than the two next largest parties combined. 
If the weather is fair and the turnout is 60% or more, there is no reason why the LDP-despite its commitment to raising consumption tax from 3% to 5% next April-should not pick up a further ao-30 seats. That, however, will be nowhere near enough to give it a workable majority of, say, 275 of the 500 seats in the lower house and thus to rule alone. So it will still need the help of a coalition partner or two. 
The LDP'S two current partners, the Social Democrats and the New Party Sakigake, are spent forces. Both lost more than half their seats in September when the renegade Sakigake members, Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan, split off to form their Democratic Party. Sakigake and the SDP now face extinction. So Mr Hashimoto needs to look elsewhere for allies. 
There are many within his own party who would not mind doing a deal with their arch-rival, the New Frontier Party (NFP), headed by Ichiro Ozawa. If Mr Ozawa's party cannot add to its existing i6o seats in the lower house, there could be defections from the NFP. Such a possibility has spurred Seiroku Kajiyama, the chief cabinet secretary and the LDP'S leading backroom fixer, into a series of late-night discussions with NFP rebels. 
Mr Hashimoto, however, has been dropping hints all week that the Democratic Party would make an ideal partner. The new party, which had its inaugural meeting the day the Diet was dissolved, is going into the election with 52 incumbent members-but is fielding 143 candidates for the single-seat constituencies and no fewer than 159 for the PR list. 
The Democrats are relying on the popularity of their co-founder, Mr Kan, to sway the undecided.

Its countries were ruled by military dictatorships, eyeing each other with suspicion and hostility, even threats of war, across borders sealed against all but a trickle of trade. Think back just seven years, and the dictatorships had given way to civilian democracies, but (Chile apart) the region's economies remained wedded to beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism, and were prostrated by inflation, instability and debt. 
And now look five years ahead. Barring accidents, by 200 an integrated, growing and relatively open market of at least 24om people, with an output of well over $i trillion, will stretch from the Brazilian north-east to Chile's Pacific coast, over what can be called (taking some geographical liberty with Brazil) South America's southern cone. 
At its heart, Brazil and Argentina, which between them account for more than half of Latin America's GDP, should have a common foreigntrade policy and, for all but a handful of products, a common external tariff, with increasingly convergent, and market-friendly, macroeconomic policies. United with them in a customs union will be their small neighbours Paraguay and Uruguay. And most, maybe all, of the rest of South America will be linked to this core by free-trade agreements. 
As investors, both local and foreign, exploit the potential for growth, scale and specialisation offered by this new market, this southern cone will be emerging as an agribusiness and mining superpower, with a diversified and modernised manufacturing industry fuelled by cheap and abundant energy. It will have forced its way back on to the world economic and business map, after an absence of two generations, and be preparing, led by a once self-doubting but already confident Brazil, to take its place, with the rest of Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada and the United States, in a freetrade area, starting around zoos, that will embrace the entire western hemisphere. 
That, at least, is the prospect. Some of it has happened already. The big push came from the formation of the southern common market, Mercosur (in Spanish; Mercosul in Portuguese), by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in 1991. True, some of the change began, and would have gone on, anyway. Latin American economies could not stay stuck for ever in the age of state industry, state inter vention and isolated markets. And Mercosur is only one in a web of international agreements-31 of them, by the count of ECLAc, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean-signed since 199o to liberalise trade within the region. Meanwhile, older but moribund sub-regional groups, such as the Andean Group soon to be ""Community""-are reviving. Yet Manuel Marin, the European commissioner who handles relations with the region, is right to call Mercosur the ""hard kernel"" of its integration. 
This is the world's fourth-largest integrated market, after NAFTA (the North American free-trade area), the European Union and Japan. It is a dynamic one. Intra-Mercosur trade has soared; combined GDP, despite ups and downs, has grown by an annual average of 3.5% since 199o; and at $5,ooo its income per head is 3o% above that of Latin America as a whole. Above all, Mercosur is seen throughout the region as the leader in the field. 
It is still not yet a full free-trade area, let alone a customs union, applying a common external tariff; its ""common market"" tag expresses only an aspiration-toward free movement not just of goods but of services, capital and labour-not fact. Even so, this is the world's most ambitious scheme of regional integration since the birth of the European Economic Community in 1957. Mercosur offers a framework and a timetable (and a snappy brandname that has become an attractive visiting-card in the rest of the world). And it has won political commitment: despite some backsliding and a few tense moments, its members, by and large, have stuck to their undertakings and kept the process moving. 
It is too early to say with confidence that Mercosur is irreversible. Much can yet go wrong: Latin America's history has seen many visionary schemes for integration that foundered on local rivalries, economic turbulence, outside meddling or their own flawed economic assumptions. But there are two basic grounds for optimism. The first is that Mercosur is the creation of democratic governments; it can fairly be seen not as a short-term expedient but as a long-term project for integration between the peoples they represent. Second, it is based on a commitment to trade liberalisation, and is being taken forward by governments pledged to broadly sound macroeconomic policies that have tamed inflation. Earlier integration schemes, such as the Latin American free-trade association of 196o, did increase trade among members, especially in manufactures, through the granting of selective bilateral preferences. But their intention was only to widen protected markets, in an ultimately doomed effort to make import-substitution work better. In contrast, Mercosur's integration is predicated on market opening and export-based growth; ""open regionalism"", as it is known. 
The clearest single measure of Mercosur's progress is the growth in trade that it has prompted. From $4 billion in 199o, trade among its four members more than tripled to $14.5 billion by 1995. There is plenty of room for more: in 1995, intra-group trade amounted to only 1.6% of Mercosur's GDP, compared with 4.5% for the nrA countries and 14% for the Eu. Trade has flowered partly because the end of inflation, followed by economic growth, produced consumer booms, first in Argentina and then in Brazil. But another reason is that Mercosur has lifted artificial barriers that had long restrained commerce between those two countries. Between them, they account for 97% of Mercosur's GDP, and they have at last recognised that they are natural trading partners. 
The assumptions changed in Asuncion 
When in 1494 Queen Isabel of Castile and King Joao II of Portugal made the Treaty of Tordesillas, fixing a boundary between their respective empires at a point 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, they created what turned out to be one of history's less porous frontiers. Though groups of marauders, and then settlers, pushed Brazil's frontier further west into the Amazon, the Mato Grosso and to the river Uruguay, there it came to rest. While exSpanish South America fractured into separate countries after achieving independence in the early i9th century, Brazil remained united. In the south, there were two bits of unfinished business. A struggle between Brazil and Argentina for control of the territory north of the river Plate was settled when Uruguay emerged as a buffer state, after British mediation. And Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay ganged up in the 186os in a terrible war which humbled an expansionist Paraguay. 
Thereafter, the two big neighbours paid remarkably little attention to each other (except on the football field). Argentina rose as an agricultural power, and then declined; Brazil got on with the business of filling its huge territory with people and industry. Until 1985, apart from a couple of border encounters, only three Brazilian presidents had ever visited Argentina, and only two Argentine rulers had made the trip the other way. Sporadic attempts to increase bilateral trade bore only modest fruit, in the face of military and political mistrust. 
That changed when civilian governments took charge again-in Argentina in 1983, in Brazil in 1985-after long periods of military rule. The two new presidents, Raul Alfonsin and Jose Sarney respectively, signed agreements aimed first at strengthening democracy and reducing military tensions; by allowing mutual inspection of nuclear facilities, for example. But they also tried to revive sick and still-protectionist economies through selective bilateral trade preferences, in the form of sectoral agreements, while maintaining restrictions on imports from other countries. 
The process then underwent a vital change: the election of Carlos Menem in Argentina in 1989, and of Fernando Collor in Brazil in 199o, brought to power governments intent on trade opening and economic reform. They scrapped import bans and quotas. In place of notions of managed trade and industrial policy, when Mercosur was born in 1991, under the Treaty of Asuncion (capital of Paraguay), it was as an instrument to achieve free trade among members and to seek the efficiencies needed for competition in the world economy. The earlier agreements had involved negotiating exceptions to general tariff protection. The Mercosur treaty turned this process inside-out, requiring automatic and progressive tariff cuts, and allowing protection only that was both selective and temporary. 
The decision in 1994 to proceed to a customs union involved a second debate as to how open Mercosur should be. Argentina, like Uruguay and Paraguay, had low tariffs on capital goods; one of its aims in opening its economy was to allow its firms cheap access to imported technology. Brazil, in contrast, wanted to protect its own capital-goods industry. In the event, the agreed common external tariff (CET) was a compromise: Argentina and the others agreed to raise tariffs, Brazil to bring them down. Today, Mercosur's average trade-weighted external tariff is 14%-well below that of any of its members (except Paraguay) in 199o, and broadly comparable to current Latin American norms. 
A customs union should help to deepen Mercosur's internal free-trade area: it obviates the need to determine the national origin of goods traded between members. But, as free-traders object, Mercosur's external tariffs vary widely from low to high, so distorting relative prices. ChileLatin America's fastest-growing economy, and one that liberalised trade earlier and more thoroughly than did others-offers a contrast. Though Chile's external tariff of ii% is only slightly lower than Mercosur's, it is applied uniformly to almost all imports (bar the rising number that come in tariff-free, under bilateral trade deals). This has prevented Chile from becoming a full Mercosur member. Still, the free-trade agreement that Mercosur reached with Chile last June, though highly complex, underlines its relative openness. Mercosur is close to a similar deal with Bolivia, and talks are due with the Andean Group as such this month, to start setting a framework for individual deals with its other members (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela). 
Trade, politics and diplomacy 
Some of the rise in trade within Mercosur represents a diversion of trade from outside sources: fo instance, the sale of cars between Brazil and Argentina; or, more deliberately, Brazil's decision to buy oil from Argentina rather than Iraq. But the rise in intra-group trade has gone hand-in-hand with an accelerating rise in Mercosur's trade with the rest oi the world. Economists agree that, overall, Mercosur has been more trade-creating than trade-diverting, the test of whether regionalism is open or closed. It has had other benefits too: without the growth in its exports to Brazil, Argentina would have suffered even worse than it did from the knock-on impact of Mexico's 1994-95 currency collapse. 
While Mercosur's exports to much of the rest of the world are dominated by primary products, trade liberalisation has helped to create local markets for manufactures. These (especially cars and car parts, chemicals and machinery) make up a sizeable part of intra-group trade: almost half of Argentina's $5.6 billion of exports to Brazil last year, and almost 85% of the $4 billion of goods that Brazil sent in return. Much of this is intra-industry trade, as similar firms, or branches of the same firm, swap products or components, taking advantage of the specialisation made possible by a bigger market. 
This process is helped along by the hefty foreign investment that Mercosur countries are attracting, some from each other, but more from outside. Outside direct investment within Mercosur has risen sharply. It totalled around $6 billion in both 1994 and 1995, and is likely to go higher this year, as multinationals, especially in the car, chemical and food industries, upgrade existing plants, build new ones or enter a region that they used to ignore. 
Mercosur has also brought political gains. Democracy and military detente were a precondition of success in the project, but have also benefited from it. Brazil and Argentina have moved from renouncing their incipient nuclear-weapons programmes to conducting joint military exercises. 
Brazil's elderly aircraft-carrier (which lacks planes) has exercised with the airmen of Argentina's navy (whose aircraft-carrier has been mothballed for several years). For the first time, small units from the two armies are due shortly to conduct a joint training exercise in peacekeeping. 
But for Mercosur, Paraguay would this year almost certainly have gone back to military rule, setting a dangerous precedent for Latin America. When in April a rebellious general moved against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Mercosur foreign ministers descended on Asuncion and demonstrated to the upstart that he would face diplomatic and economic isolation. Mercosur's presidents promptly agreed that, as in the Eu, democracy should be a formal condition of membership. Revealingly, elements of Chile's right-wing opposition, close to General Pinochet and the armed forces, cited this as a reason to oppose their country's deal with Mercosur. 
Another indicator of Mercosur's effectiveness is its diplomatic pulling power in the wider world. Last December, it signed a framework agreement with the EU, its largest single source of external trade and investment. The deal is not all that some enthusiasts in Mercosur hoped for, but it sets a tentative target of free trade by 2005. It now looks increasingly likely that the planned western-hemisphere free-trade area will involve an agreement between NAFrA and Mercosur. And the Japanese, during a visit to the region by their prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, in August, expressed interest in starting a dialogue with Mercosur. 
In sum, Mercosur has got off to a surprisingly good start. Yet this survey will argue that if it is to continue to prosper, it faces tougher challenges than those it has surmounted so far. The first is the maintenance of macroeconomic stability, open trading regimes and economic growth in Brazil and in Argentina; for while Mercosur can contribute to all of these, it cannot flourish without them. The second is to make an integrated market a reality by improving transport links and customs procedures, standardising or demolishing a mountain of rules and regulations, and striking the right balance between the nation state and common-market institutions. All of these issues are likely to test its members' commitment to their common project. ","THINK back 20 years, and the southern part of South America was both an economic backwater and an armed camp. Its countries were ruled by military dictatorships, eyeing each other with suspicion and hostility, even threats of war, across borders sealed against all but a trickle of trade. Think back just seven years, and the dictatorships had given way to civilian democracies, but (Chile apart) the region's economies remained wedded to beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism, and were prostrated by inflation, instability and debt. 
And now look five years ahead. Barring accidents, by 200 an integrated, growing and relatively open market of at least 24om people, with an output of well over $i trillion, will stretch from the Brazilian north-east to Chile's Pacific coast, over what can be called (taking some geographical liberty with Brazil) South America's southern cone. 
At its heart, Brazil and Argentina, which between them account for more than half of Latin America's GDP, should have a common foreigntrade policy and, for all but a handful of products, a common external tariff, with increasingly convergent, and market-friendly, macroeconomic policies. United with them in a customs union will be their small neighbours Paraguay and Uruguay. And most, maybe all, of the rest of South America will be linked to this core by free-trade agreements. 
As investors, both local and foreign, exploit the potential for growth, scale and specialisation offered by this new market, this southern cone will be emerging as an agribusiness and mining superpower, with a diversified and modernised manufacturing industry fuelled by cheap and abundant energy. It will have forced its way back on to the world economic and business map, after an absence of two generations, and be preparing, led by a once self-doubting but already confident Brazil, to take its place, with the rest of Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada and the United States, in a freetrade area, starting around zoos, that will embrace the entire western hemisphere. 
That, at least, is the prospect. Some of it has happened already. The big push came from the formation of the southern common market, Mercosur (in Spanish; Mercosul in Portuguese), by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in 1991. True, some of the change began, and would have gone on, anyway. Latin American economies could not stay stuck for ever in the age of state industry, state inter vention and isolated markets. And Mercosur is only one in a web of international agreements-31 of them, by the count of ECLAc, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean-signed since 199o to liberalise trade within the region. Meanwhile, older but moribund sub-regional groups, such as the Andean Group soon to be ""Community""-are reviving. Yet Manuel Marin, the European commissioner who handles relations with the region, is right to call Mercosur the ""hard kernel"" of its integration. 
This is the world's fourth-largest integrated market, after NAFTA (the North American free-trade area), the European Union and Japan. It is a dynamic one. Intra-Mercosur trade has soared; combined GDP, despite ups and downs, has grown by an annual average of 3.5% since 199o; and at $5,ooo its income per head is 3o% above that of Latin America as a whole. Above all, Mercosur is seen throughout the region as the leader in the field. 
It is still not yet a full free-trade area, let alone a customs union, applying a common external tariff; its ""common market"" tag expresses only an aspiration-toward free movement not just of goods but of services, capital and labour-not fact. Even so, this is the world's most ambitious scheme of regional integration since the birth of the European Economic Community in 1957. Mercosur offers a framework and a timetable (and a snappy brandname that has become an attractive visiting-card in the rest of the world). And it has won political commitment: despite some backsliding and a few tense moments, its members, by and large, have stuck to their undertakings and kept the process moving. 
It is too early to say with confidence that Mercosur is irreversible. Much can yet go wrong: Latin America's history has seen many visionary schemes for integration that foundered on local rivalries, economic turbulence, outside meddling or their own flawed economic assumptions. But there are two basic grounds for optimism. The first is that Mercosur is the creation of democratic governments; it can fairly be seen not as a short-term expedient but as a long-term project for integration between the peoples they represent. Second, it is based on a commitment to trade liberalisation, and is being taken forward by governments pledged to broadly sound macroeconomic policies that have tamed inflation. Earlier integration schemes, such as the Latin American free-trade association of 196o, did increase trade among members, especially in manufactures, through the granting of selective bilateral preferences. But their intention was only to widen protected markets, in an ultimately doomed effort to make import-substitution work better. In contrast, Mercosur's integration is predicated on market opening and export-based growth; ""open regionalism"", as it is known. 
The clearest single measure of Mercosur's progress is the growth in trade that it has prompted. From $4 billion in 199o, trade among its four members more than tripled to $14.5 billion by 1995. There is plenty of room for more: in 1995, intra-group trade amounted to only 1.6% of Mercosur's GDP, compared with 4.5% for the nrA countries and 14% for the Eu. Trade has flowered partly because the end of inflation, followed by economic growth, produced consumer booms, first in Argentina and then in Brazil. But another reason is that Mercosur has lifted artificial barriers that had long restrained commerce between those two countries. Between them, they account for 97% of Mercosur's GDP, and they have at last recognised that they are natural trading partners. 
The assumptions changed in Asuncion 
When in 1494 Queen Isabel of Castile and King Joao II of Portugal made the Treaty of Tordesillas, fixing a boundary between their respective empires at a point 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, they created what turned out to be one of history's less porous frontiers. Though groups of marauders, and then settlers, pushed Brazil's frontier further west into the Amazon, the Mato Grosso and to the river Uruguay, there it came to rest. While exSpanish South America fractured into separate countries after achieving independence in the early i9th century, Brazil remained united. In the south, there were two bits of unfinished business. A struggle between Brazil and Argentina for control of the territory north of the river Plate was settled when Uruguay emerged as a buffer state, after British mediation. And Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay ganged up in the 186os in a terrible war which humbled an expansionist Paraguay. 
Thereafter, the two big neighbours paid remarkably little attention to each other (except on the football field). Argentina rose as an agricultural power, and then declined; Brazil got on with the business of filling its huge territory with people and industry. Until 1985, apart from a couple of border encounters, only three Brazilian presidents had ever visited Argentina, and only two Argentine rulers had made the trip the other way. Sporadic attempts to increase bilateral trade bore only modest fruit, in the face of military and political mistrust. 
That changed when civilian governments took charge again-in Argentina in 1983, in Brazil in 1985-after long periods of military rule. The two new presidents, Raul Alfonsin and Jose Sarney respectively, signed agreements aimed first at strengthening democracy and reducing military tensions; by allowing mutual inspection of nuclear facilities, for example. But they also tried to revive sick and still-protectionist economies through selective bilateral trade preferences, in the form of sectoral agreements, while maintaining restrictions on imports from other countries. 
The process then underwent a vital change: the election of Carlos Menem in Argentina in 1989, and of Fernando Collor in Brazil in 199o, brought to power governments intent on trade opening and economic reform. They scrapped import bans and quotas. In place of notions of managed trade and industrial policy, when Mercosur was born in 1991, under the Treaty of Asuncion (capital of Paraguay), it was as an instrument to achieve free trade among members and to seek the efficiencies needed for competition in the world economy. The earlier agreements had involved negotiating exceptions to general tariff protection. The Mercosur treaty turned this process inside-out, requiring automatic and progressive tariff cuts, and allowing protection only that was both selective and temporary. 
The decision in 1994 to proceed to a customs union involved a second debate as to how open Mercosur should be. Argentina, like Uruguay and Paraguay, had low tariffs on capital goods; one of its aims in opening its economy was to allow its firms cheap access to imported technology. Brazil, in contrast, wanted to protect its own capital-goods industry. In the event, the agreed common external tariff (CET) was a compromise: Argentina and the others agreed to raise tariffs, Brazil to bring them down. Today, Mercosur's average trade-weighted external tariff is 14%-well below that of any of its members (except Paraguay) in 199o, and broadly comparable to current Latin American norms. 
A customs union should help to deepen Mercosur's internal free-trade area: it obviates the need to determine the national origin of goods traded between members. But, as free-traders object, Mercosur's external tariffs vary widely from low to high, so distorting relative prices. ChileLatin America's fastest-growing economy, and one that liberalised trade earlier and more thoroughly than did others-offers a contrast. Though Chile's external tariff of ii% is only slightly lower than Mercosur's, it is applied uniformly to almost all imports (bar the rising number that come in tariff-free, under bilateral trade deals). This has prevented Chile from becoming a full Mercosur member. Still, the free-trade agreement that Mercosur reached with Chile last June, though highly complex, underlines its relative openness. Mercosur is close to a similar deal with Bolivia, and talks are due with the Andean Group as such this month, to start setting a framework for individual deals with its other members (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela).

INCONCLUSIVE as it was, the vote in Japan's general elec. tion on October 20th was a vote for reform. In a country so uniformly well-educated and well-informed, the record low turnout of 59% was an indictment of the many missed opportunities and broken promises during the past three years of coalition governments of varying stripe. Expectations of economic and political change-to toss aside corruption, and the suffocating blanket of bureaucratic controls that have cosseted particular manufacturers, farmers and other producer groups at the consumer's and the country's expense-ran rampant when the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) broke up in 1993 after 38 years of uninterrupted rule. But many of these hopes have been disappointed. No wonder so many voters stayed at home, or went to the baseball. 
Now the Liberal Democrats are back with more of a mandate to govern, having boosted their strength in the soo-member lower house of the Diet (parliament) from 211 to 239 seats. Perversely, however, their victory at the ballot box has left Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister and the leader of the LDP, with less room to manoeuvre-and, quite possibly, a foreshortened term in office (see page 39). The LDP-led coalition that he will head after being reappointed as prime minister on November 7th will have its work cut out just trying to hang on to power. 
A real change, but not yet a sufficient one 
Disappointing though this is, it does not mean that the Japan of 1996 is the same as the Japan of 1993 or of 1983. There has been at least one, fundamental, change. In the 198os, certainly, and in the early 199os, widely, government was seen in Japan as the solution of most economic and social problems. Now, bureaucrats are no longer seen as the solution: they are seen as the problem. That is why all the political parties in this general-election campaign declared themselves in favour of ""administrative reform"". Alas, none of them offered convincing or clear plans; none but the LDP looked likely to form a credible governing team. 
That does not, however, mean that this issue is dead. In so far as it is organised at all, Japanese politics is likely to continue to organise itself around the question of the role and power of government. If the LDP-led coalition fails to deliver any deregulation and any reform, that will provide its opponents with their chance. Which is a strong reason to expect at least some progress from Mr Hashimoto. 
It is unlikely to come quickly. The new government's most pressing task will be financial. Including obligations incurred by local government, Japan's national debt now stands at a staggering Y440 trillion ($3.9 trillion), almost equivalent to the country's annual GDP. Meanwhile, the biggest ofthe immediate liabilities-settling theY20 trillion debt remaining from the defunct Japan National Railways-is about to arise. The bill will cost every man, woman and child in Japan V16o,ooo apiece. Using public money to liquidate the seven failed jusen (mortgage companies) earlier this year all but brought down the government, and that cost taxpayers a paltry V685 billion, a mere Y5,500 per person. For Mr Hashimoto, the gathering clouds threaten a drenching. 
All the more reason to press on, at speed, with reforms aimed at freeing the economy. In the short term, this means deregulation rather than the broad, administrative reforms that were so often touted during the campaign. Japanese government would be healthier if its bureaucrats had less discretion and were more accountable to their political and electoral masters (indeed, if bureaucrats were to be made to act like servants rather than masters, as they have for decades). Changing laws to achieve this, and restructuring ministries, is worth doing. But what Japan most needs now is straightforward deregulation. 
As if on cue, the government's Economic Planning Agency has just published a study showing that even the modest steps taken so far to loosen up the economy have paid off handsomely. A handful of measures-such as easing the restrictions that prevented department stores from expanding into local neighbourhoods, approving the construction of threestorey instead of only two-storey wooden houses, and allowing agencies for temporary workers to be set up-are said to have added an average of V7.9 trillion a year to the economy over the past six years. Modest they may be, but without them the country's abysmal growth since the early 199os would have been o.6 percentage points lower each year. 
Such evidence ought to strengthen the chances of a new batch of deregulatory proposals that are to be published in late November by the Economic Council, an advisory panel within the prime minister's office. These cover six troubled aspects of the economy-finance, telecommunications, employment, distribution, land and housing, and health and welfare.

It is not that the Economic Council's suggestions are so outrageous.

But the Economic Council's reforms are radical in at least one respect: as a matter of principle, they are designed to provide the consumer with greater choice-by giving freer rein to market forces. 
As he struggles to keep his fragile coalition together, Mr Hashimoto could win rounds of public applause by defending and implementing such reforms. A fine way to do so would be to turn the advisory Economic Council into a fullblooded Economic Reform Agency, with statutory powers. If Mr Hashimoto were to act, the Japanese economy could really roll. And his government might even survive. ","Something really has changed in Japanese politics . But not enough , as the general election showed 
 INCONCLUSIVE as it was , the vote in Japan 's general elec . tion on October 20th was a vote for reform . In a country so uniformly well - educated and well - informed , the record low turnout of 59 % was an indictment of the many missed opportunities and broken promises during the past three years of coalition governments of varying stripe . Expectations of economic and political change - to toss aside corruption , and the suffocating blanket of bureaucratic controls that have cosseted particular manufacturers , farmers and other producer groups at the consumer 's and the country 's expense - ran rampant when the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) broke up in 1993 after 38 years of uninterrupted rule . But many of these hopes have been disappointed . No wonder so many voters stayed at home , or went to the baseball . 
 Now the Liberal Democrats are back with more of a mandate to govern , having boosted their strength in the soo - member lower house of the Diet ( parliament ) from 211 to 239 seats . Perversely , however , their victory at the ballot box has left Ryutaro Hashimoto , with less room to manoeuvre - and , quite possibly , a foreshortened term in office ( see page 39 ) . The LDP - led coalition that Ryutaro Hashimoto will head after being reappointed as prime minister on November 7th will have its work cut out just trying to hang on to power . 
 A real change , but not yet a sufficient one 
 Disappointing though this is , it does not mean that the Japan of 1996 is the same as the Japan of 1993 or of 1983 . There has been at least one , fundamental , change . In the 198os , certainly , and in the early 199os , widely , government was seen in Japan as the solution of most economic and social problems . Now , bureaucrats are no longer seen as the solution : they are seen as the problem . That is why all the political parties in this general - election campaign declared themselves in favour of "" administrative reform "" . Alas , none of them offered convincing or clear plans ; none but the LDP looked likely to form a credible governing team . 
 That does not , however , mean that this issue is dead . In so far as it is organised at all , Japanese politics is likely to continue to organise itself around the question of the role and power of government . If the LDP - led coalition fails to deliver any deregulation and any reform , that will provide its opponents with their chance . Which is a strong reason to expect at least some progress from Ryutaro Hashimoto . 
 It is unlikely to come quickly . The new government 's most pressing task will be financial . Including obligations incurred by local government , Japan 's national debt now stands at a staggering Y440 trillion ( $ 3.9 trillion ) , almost equivalent to the country 's annual GDP . Meanwhile , the biggest ofthe immediate liabilities - settling theY20 trillion debt remaining from the defunct Japan National Railways - is about to arise . The bill will cost every man , woman and child in Japan V16o , ooo apiece . Using public money to liquidate the seven failed jusen ( mortgage companies ) earlier this year all but brought down the government , and that cost taxpayers a paltry V685 billion , a mere Y5,500 per person . For Ryutaro Hashimoto , the gathering clouds threaten a drenching . 
 All the more reason to press on , at speed , with reforms aimed at freeing the economy . In the short term , this means deregulation rather than the broad , administrative reforms that were so often touted during the campaign . Japanese government would be healthier if its bureaucrats had less discretion and were more accountable to their political and electoral masters ( indeed , if bureaucrats were to be made to act like servants rather than masters , as they have for decades ) . Changing laws to achieve this , and restructuring ministries , is worth doing . But what Japan most needs now is straightforward deregulation . 
 As if on cue , the government 's Economic Planning Agency has just published a study showing that even the modest steps taken so far to loosen up the economy have paid off handsomely . A handful of measures - such as easing the restrictions that prevented department stores from expanding into local neighbourhoods , approving the construction of threestorey instead of only two - storey wooden houses , and allowing agencies for temporary workers to be set up - are said to have added an average of V7.9 trillion a year to the economy over the past six years . Modest they may be , but without them the country 's abysmal growth since the early 199os would have been o.6 percentage points lower each year . 
 Such evidence ought to strengthen the chances of a new batch of deregulatory proposals that are to be published in late November by the Economic Council , an advisory panel within the prime minister 's office . These cover six troubled aspects of the economy - finance , telecommunications , employment , distribution , land and housing , and health and welfare . So far , officials within other ministries have not been allowed to tinker with the proposals for fear that they would neuter them . Which , given a chance , they would . 
 It is not that the Economic Council 's suggestions are so outrageous . One simply proposes raising the plot - ratio ( ie , height to floor - space ) of buildings to provide better land use in Japan 's crowded cities . Another would liberalise commissions on securities transactions so that brokers could offer discount services .

1996-10-26,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224121071/fulltext/C61D3047EF8D4057PQ/19?accountid=14657,"THE one clear result of Japan's general election on October 20th is that it has solved nothing. Although the dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) headed by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, fell short of winning an absolute majority in the soo-seat lower house of the Diet, it nevertheless increased its strength from 211 to 239 members. Meanwhile, the challenge mounted by Ichiro Ozawa and his New Frontier Party (NFP) flopped miserably. Far from threatening the LDP's dominance, the main opposition party wound up with 156 seats, four fewer than it had before the election. 
The irony is that, in clinching a bigger lead, Mr Hashimoto has found that forming a new administration has suddenly become more difficult. The question this past week has been not just what political complexion Japan's new government will have, but how long it will last. Some are already beginning to suggest that another election could be needed within a year or so. 
Mr Hashimoto has two immediate problems. The first is the collapse of the LDP'S two former coalition partners: the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the smaller New Party Sakigake. Both were devastated in last Sunday's election; their combined strength plummeted to only 17 seats (see chart). The result is that, whereas Mr Hashimoto could rely on a comfortable 40-seat majority over the opposition's combined strength before the election, the best he can muster now is a slender majority of five or six, even though his own party's strength rose. 
The prime minister's other problem is that he cannot even bank on that slender majority. After flip-flopping a few times, the two surviving Sakigake members have now decided not to join his new government. They say they will co-operate with the LDP on administrative reforms, but from outside the cabinet. 
Meanwhile, Takako Doi-the popular speaker of the house who was persuaded to rejoin the crumbling SDP on the eve of the election and lead its fight for survival-has threatened not to throw her party's lot in with the government. As with the pair of Sakigake survivors, Miss Doi has offered to support an LDP-led coalition on a case-by-case basis, but to keep her troops out of the cabinet. 
There is no question that the SDP'S fall from grace started when it compromised its socialist principles by joining forces with the conservative LDP to form a coalition government in 1994. Unlike the former SDP leader, Tomiichi Murayama, the redoubtable Miss Doi is not so easily seduced by the promise of power-and is determined not to let her party make such a near-fatal mistake twice. The SDP needs time, she says, to heal its wounds. 
Others have learned much the same lesson about consorting with the LDP, and have been seeking likewise to distance themselves from the ruling party and its venal antics. The new Democratic Party of Japan, formed just weeks before the election by two Sakigake renegades, Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan, has been even more reluctant to help Mr Hashimoto in his quest to form a government. 
The fledgling Democratic Party did nowhere near as well last Sunday as expected, barely managing to keep its pre-election strength of 52 members. Pundits had predicted giddily that it would win at least 80 seats, making it a new focal point for liberal-minded forces within the Diet. But the Democrats confused the public by providing two figureheads, and by refusing to say whether they were standing unequivocally as an opposition party or as one that was prepared to work for reform from within a coalition government. 
To his credit, Mr Hatoyama has insisted all along that his new party-with its membership of young reformist politicians drawn largely from the ranks of the SDP and the Sakigake-should promote its legislative agenda from the opposition benches. But his colleague and co-founder, Mr Kan, has continued to hint otherwise. Not surprisingly, it has been Mr Kan whom the LDP leadership has been wooing assiduously this past week. 
As health and welfare minister in the previous coalition government, Mr Kan has made himself the most popular politician in Japan. He it was who rooted out the bureaucratic corruption within the health service that had allowed some 2,000 haemophiliacs to contract AIDS though the use of unheated blood products. The populist Mr Kan let it be known that he would not be averse to another prominent cabinet post. But as Mr Hashimoto's new coalition has begun to look increasingly wobbly, joining the cabinet seems to have lost some of its appeal. 
In desperation, the LDP bigwigs have started courting their bitter rivals (and former colleagues before the bust-up of 1993) in Mr Ozawa's New Frontier Party. Dissidents within the NFP who have remained loyal to Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata, both former prime ministers, have been seething under Mr Ozawa's dictatorial rule and have threatened to walk out of the party on several occasions. Mr Hata's group, in particular, was on the verge of forming a party of its own several months ago but cancelled its plans when a general election appeared to be imminent. 
Many of the NFP'S younger members have also become distressed with the way the Soka Gakkai-a lay Buddhist organisation with deep pockets and an agenda of its own-has tightened its grip on their party. With roots in 8m households in Tokyo, Osaka and other big cities across Japan, the Soka Gakkai is by far the biggest vote-generator in the country. It is reckoned to be able to deliver an additional 20,000 votes (more than to% of the total cast in a typical urban constituency) to any candidate it chooses to back. In Sunday's election, the Soka Gakkai backed more than zoo of the 235 candidates that the NFP fielded in single-seat constituencies. Those unhappy with religion's incursion into politics have been urging Mr Hata and Mr Hosokawa to wash their hands of the NFP and its Buddhist friends. 
The LDP would be delighted if they did: between them, Mr Hata and Mr Hosokawa could be expected to bring anything up to 30 supporters with them if they defected and joined an LDr-led coalition. Such a move would provide Mr Hashimoto with the majority he is seeking in the upper as well as the lower house. 
But the two senior NFP leaders are involved in a power struggle with Mr Ozawa, who half-heartedly offered to stand down after the party's poor showing. During the campaign, Mr Ozawa promised to slash taxes, instigate drastic administrative reforms and prop up the economy-and vowed to leave politics if he was prevented from honouring his pledges. But now the truculent Mr Ozawa, backed by the majority of his older colleagues in the NFP and their Soka Gakkai supporters, has decided not to go without a fight. No love is lost between Mr Hashimoto and Mr Ozawa, but this is the one battle that the prime minister is praying his erstwhile rival in the LDP will win outright The more disgruntled opposition Mps, the better for Mr Hashimoto.

The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development predicted that growth in former communist economies would accelerate next year from a projected 4% rate in 1996. But all of them, it said, must do more to reform their financial systems and improve infrastructure. 
Bhutto out 
Benazir Bhutto was dismissed as prime minister of Pakistan by the country's president. The president said her government was incompetent and corrupt; it, and parliament, were also dismissed. Miss Bhutto was put under house arrest, but later freed. A general election is to be held in February. Japan's Liberal Democratic Party won over enough defectors to form a government. Ryutaro Hashimoto was formally reappointed prime minister. 
A Khmer Rouge commander and 300 fighters became the latest rebel group to defect to the Cambodian government. But Pol Pot, the rebel leader, was reported to be preparing to renew his attacks on government forces. A senior official in Washington said America had revised its view, and saw no prospect of Afghanistan's civil war coming to an early end. ","Yes, he won Bill Clinton won the American presidential election with 49% of the popular vote against Bob Dole's 41%, and 31 states against his 19. He becomes the first Democrat to be elected twice since Franklin Roosevelt. But the Republicans held on to both the Senate and the House of Rep resentatives. Ross Perot won 8% of the vote. Less than half of the eligible voters cast their ballots, a record low. 
Warren Christopher resigned as secretary of state, but will stay on until Mr Clinton's inauguration in January. Several other team members, including William Perry, the defence secretary, Mickey Kantor, the commerce secretary, and Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff are also to go. 
Voters in California approved by a large margin a proposition to end racial quotas in state contracting and employment. 
In Nicaragua, expecting official (but still provisional) results of its October 2oth elections on November 7th, the Sandinists accused the seemingly victorious Liberal Alliance of fraud. They demanded a fresh vote in two big provinces, and called a day of ""civic protest""-peaceful, apparently-on November 8th. 
Hell in Zaire 
All parties in the war in eastern Zaire have agreed to accept a multinational force to save refugees, but few countries have offered troops. France wants military intervention; European Union aid ministers met to discuss proposals. More than a million people, mostly Hutu refugees, have been left without food or shelter after aid agencies were driven out of the region by fighting. Having seized part of eastern Zaire, rebels offered a three-week ceasefire. 
Leaders of big third-world countries, meeting in Zimbabwe, accused rich countries of trying to dictate rules of world trade. One big gripe: rules on labour conditions, seen by the poor as a way of negating their lower wages. But Bangladesh, which supplies half of Europe's T-shirts, said it no longer used child labour in its textile factories. 
Israel's infrastructure minister, Ariel Sharon, unveiled a plan to settle lOO,ooo more colonists in the occupied West Bank Not a government plan, said a spokesman. 
In Algeria, Islamist guerrillas seized ten women and three children at a village and slit their throats. Later, in another village, 31 more people were murdered the same way. 
Interregnum 
Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, took back presidential powers less than 24 hours after handing them over to his prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, to undergo a heart operation. Doctors said the seven-hour quintuple bypass went well. 
Robert Tatum, an American businessman, was murdered in Moscow. He had been seeking control of the city's Radisson-Slavyanskaya hotel.

After its victory in the recent general election, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has managed to cobble together enough ofa majority to enable it to rule the country without having to pay anything more than lip service to the opposition. So, with Japan's return to single-party government-for the first time since the LDP lost office in 1993 after 38 years of uninterrupted rule-are the Liberal Democrats about to revert to their business-asusual brand of politics? It looks like it. This week's in-fighting, leading to a cabinet reshuffle, suggests that Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, will be hard pressed to prevent his party from slipping back into many of its old ways. 
The LDP won 239 of the 500 seats in the lower chamber of the Diet (parliament) on October 2oth. Since then, the party chieftains have extracted pledges of allegiance from more than a dozen independents and other conservatives keen to rejoin the LDP once the dust settles. 
Having seen their pre-election strength plunge from a combined 86 seats to just 17, the LDP's two former coalition partners, the Social Democrats and the New Party Sakigake, are glad these days of any scrap of influence over the ruling party. They will side with the government on most issues, giving Mr Hashimoto a comfortable 270 votes in the lower chamber. 
Reverting to form, the Liberal Democrats have spent the past week carving up the spoils of victory along traditional factional lines. The LDP'S old factions-the source of much of its internal strife and venal behaviour-were supposedly abolished when it limped from power three years ago to do penance in opposition. Yet, in formally announcing his new zi-member cabinet shortly after his own reappointment as prime minister on November 7th, Mr Hashimoto handed out portfolios according to the old LDP formula. Four posts apiece went to each of the party's four big battalions (the Obuchi, Miyazawa, Mitsuzuka and Nakasone factions), one to a minor LDP group (the Komoto faction), and four more to senior Liberal Democrats from the rubber-stamping upper house. 
All the main cabinet appointments have gone to, or remained with, party heavyweights. The former LDP secretarygeneral, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, has taken over the finance ministry. He has had cabinet experience twice before (trade and foreign affairs) and was involved in privatising Japan National Railways. His clout and experience are expected to make him a central figure in the LDP's proposals for streamlining the bureaucracy, especially the finance ministry. 
Yukihiko Ikeda, who was well thought of as foreign minister during the previous government, has kept his job. The foreign ministry has traditionally gone to a member of the Miyazawa faction, to which Mr Ikeda belongs. Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior member of the Obuchi faction, has been kept on as the chief cabinet secretary and government spokesman. 
Likewise, the main posts within the party itself have remained largely unchanged. Koichi Kato stays on as the LDP'S secretary-general and number two after Mr Hashimoto. Mr Kato went through the ritual of offering to stand down-because of allegations about receiving an illicit Y10m ($go,ooo) political donation-but was easily persuaded to remain at his post. 
With factional in-fighting dominating the scene like old times, Mr Hashimoto is going to have his work cut out trying to honour his election promises. Apart from streamlining the bureaucracy, the prime minister has promised to tackle several pressing issues, among them the need to find new places to put Americans removed from their bases in Okinawa, legislation to provide insurance for public nursing of the elderly, and reform of the financial system. 
To secure the Social Democrats' and the New Party Sakigake's support, the LDP agreed to submit bills before the end of january that would strip the finance ministry of some of its power and provide a measure of independence for the Bank of Japan. In all it agreed to tackle some 14 issues, including legislation to make it easier to set up non-profit organisations and the appointment of a Diet committee to review the tax system, especially the scheduled increase in consumption tax from 3% to 5% next April. Many of these reforms risk being forgotten, if the LDP reverts to form. ","THE days of coalition government in Japan are over .

WHEN Japan's voters returned the Lil eral Democratic Party to power in October after a three-year interregnum, most people assumed that the victors would quickly forget their election promises of ""administrative reform""-shorthand for taking power over the economy out of the hands of Japanese bureaucrats. For once, the sceptics may be wrong. On November lith Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, promised that his government would undertake a sweeping deregulation of the country's financial system by 2001. Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the new finance minister, called the proposals ""the equivalent of London's Big Bang"". 
In search of a good, if hackneyed image (earlier this year South Korea used the same phrase to describe its own financial-reform package), Mr Mitsuzuka may have been overstating his case. Few of these proposals are new; many were proposed by a government committee in August. Detail is lacking. Some important areas for reform have been ignored. And there will be opposition from vested interests, especially Japan's big securities firms, to those reforms that the government has proposed. But for all that, the prime minister has set a deadline and given his pledge. This time, at least, there seems to be the political will for serious reform. 
About time too. Bureaucrats and politicians alike appear to have realised at last that the glacial pace of Japan's previous financial reforms has strangled the country's economic recovery and thwarted Tokyo's pretensions to be an international financial centre. While it has been mired in red tape, the world's two other big financial centres, London and New York, have roared ahead. 
Tokyo also faces a growing challenge from Hong Kong and Singapore, which would both like to become Asia's main financial hub. Fed up with Japanese bureaucracy, some financial folk are already moving to Singapore and other centres with a lighter regulatory touch. They are not the only ones leaving town: over the past three years, 54 companies have delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. ""Shock therapy is necessary.The alternative is for Tokyo to become a local market,"" a senior bureaucrat at the finance ministry told foreign journalists this week. 
Japan's over-regulated and compartmentalised financial system is a product of both accident and design. After the second world war, the Americans imposed a version of their own Glass-Steagall act, which separates commercial and investment banking, in the shape of Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law. But bureaucrats also designed the financial system to make it easier to channel savings into favoured industries: the more segregated the various parts of the financial sector were, the easier it was to control the institutions through which savings were channelled. For example, long-term credit banks made long-term loans to industry. In addition, they were given a monopoly on issuing fixed-rate debt. Commercial banks took deposits and lent at floating rates. All interest rates were set by the finance ministry. 
Much of this apparatus is still intact. Banks face fierce competition for corporate business, especially now that big companies can tap the capital markets themselves. But the regulations prevent bankers from meeting this challenge by underwriting equities. They are also barred from selling insurance. Other sorts of financial firms also have their hands tied: securities firms cannot offer banking or insurance services, and insurance firms cannot go into banking or securities. Still too tight 
The sharp divisions between businesses have been relaxed a bit, but only gradually. Interest rates began to be liberalised in 1984. At the end of 1993, banks were finally allowed to underwrite corporate bonds (though not equities) through subsidiaries. And from the beginning of October, life and non-life insurers have been free to enter each other's business, again via subsidiaries. In spite of all this, the boundaries that remain between businesses are still substantial. 
Such tight control has become not just redundant, but positively harmful. To enable financial firms to earn a crust, bureaucrats have allowed the cost of many financial products and services to remain high by approving cartels and discouraging aggressive competition. Insurance premiums are fixed by bureaucratic fiat. Two decades after they were scrapped in America, and a decade after they disappeared in Britain, fixed commissions on all but the biggest share trades still raise the cost of buying equities in Japan. 
Mr Hashimoto now says that he wants to do away with this rigid financial system. Insurers, banks and securities firms, he promises, will be allowed to enter one another's business. Legal barriers separating the different sorts of banks are to be scrapped. Stock commissions and insurance premiums will be deregulated. The asset-management business will be opened up and the detailed rules that govern how pension funds allocate their money will be abandoned for a more general prudential requirement. 
Light the fuse. . . 
That is not all. The quality of financial information disclosed by companies will be improved by the adoption of accounts ""consistent"" with those of other developed countries. In short, assets will be valued at their proper market price, not the price at which they were bought. Pension funds will have to do this from next April. (Given the precarious state of many Japanese banks, however, the government will surely give them much longer to make a change that will make their financial situation appear far gloomier.) 
With a list of reforms this long, it would seem churlish to quibble that the government is not planning to do enough. Yet conspicuously absent from its ""to do"" list is any mention of the privatisation of the banking operations of the post office. Japan's post office is the world's biggest bank. Since it does not have to worry about shareholders, it can offer higher rates than the banks. And its deposits are fully guaranteed by the government. Small wonder, given fears about the health of private banks, that its deposits have grown by over 11% since 1994. Banks claim, justifiably, that a publicly-owned post office distorts competition. On November ith Shunsaku Hashimoto, the chairman of Japan's bankers' association, chastised the government for not tackling this question. 
Such carping aside, the government's deregulatory proposals are generally excellent in intent. Does it have the stomach to push them through? The finance ministry claims that it has. As evidence, it says that a bill to scrap the law that allows only licensed banks to deal in foreign exchange will be introduced in the next session of the Diet (parliament). This, however, is fairly uncontroversial. Few, if any, institutions will be put out of business. Other steps will be implemented only if the government is prepared to put up with the squeals of pain from those whose profits are threatened by deregulation. 
Chief squealers will be Japan's 230 securities firms. Their income comes from commissions on share-trading and from selling mutual funds. They are already suffering from a sluggish Japanese stockmarket: turnover has fallen 75% since the late 1980s. Deregulation of stockbrokers' commissions, and the entry of big banks and insurers with lots of branches into the equity and mutual-fund business, will put many brokers out of business. The prime minister says that he will tolerate such bankruptcies. Perhaps he will. But a fear of letting firms fail probably means that the government will shy away from scrapping the Article 65 restrictions altogether. 
Instead, the authorities are likely to go for a more convoluted solution. To ""moderate"" competition throughout the financial industry, it seems likely that firms will be allowed to enter markets from which they have hitherto been excluded only by setting up a new business under the umbrella of a holding company. First, however, holding companies, which were banned after the second world war, will have to be legalised. Even then they will prove attractive to financial firms only if the government introduces a consolidated tax system, so that profits in one part of a company's operations can be offset by losses in another. 
Implementing all of this in five years and making sure that vested interests do not neuter the proposals will be a Herculean task. A lot of people think that the government is not up to it. There have been many deregulatory promises unkept in the past. And when change has occurred, it has been frustratingly slow. But there now seems to be a consensus among politicians and bureaucrats that the Japanese financial system needs root-and-branch reform. It is surely telling that a top official at the finance ministry, the country's most powerful bureaucracy, says that, in effect, Japan should have a more freewheeling financial system before its current one makes the country an also-ran. ","The Japanese government has announced its intention to reform the financial system . Should its proposals be taken seriously ?

The reformist mettle of Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, is about to get its first test. On November 12th, the day after Mr Hashimoto promised to deregulate the financial system, an advisory committee to the prime minister came out with the final version of a report into whether the Bank of Japan should be given more independence from the Ministry of Finance. Yes, said the report, it should, but only in return for greater accountability. 
Yet although the bank's governor, Yasuo Matsushita, supported the proposed reforms in public, in private its officials were disappointed at how little independence the measures would actually bring. Officials from the finance ministry would still be able to attend discussions of the bank's policy board; the government would be able to postpone centralbank decisions (it did not say for how long); and the report did not address the question of whether the ministry would still have control over the bank's budget. 
Since the report proposed to take little power away from them, finance ministry officials were understandably silent on the subject. Whether the meekness of the committee's recommendations was the result of strong-arming by the finance ministry is another matter. Six of the eight members were academics over whom the ministry presumably held little sway.

Does it matter if the bank does not get more independence? It may not. Countries who have given their central banks a greater measure of independence have done so because of their politicians' temptation to inflate the economy to get re-elected. In Japan, to get re-elected, politicians generally distribute pork, not growth. The country's inflation record has been second-to-none. 
Still, with Japan's stock of debt escalating as fast as it is-this year gross debt will almost equal the country's GDP-the temptation to inflate is presumably rising. An independent central bank might prevent that happening. The prime minister himself has said that reforming the 54-year-old law governing the bank is his government's most important task. 
All is not lost for the central bankers. The revision of the law is now to be discussed by yet another committee, the Financial System Research Council, which will draft a new law defining the Bank of Japan's status. Mr Hashimoto is then due to present this bill to the next full session of parliament. The prime minister could lean on this committee to propose far bolder recommendations than those contained in this week's report. If he is serious about reform, he will have to. ","PROMISES are one thing , action quite another . Ryutaro Hashimoto's is about to get Ryutaro Hashimoto's first test . On November 12th , the day after Mr Hashimoto promised to deregulate the financial system , an advisory committee to the prime minister came out with the final version of a report into whether the Bank of Japan should be given more independence from the Ministry of Finance . Yes , said the report , it should , but only in return for greater accountability . 
 Yet although the bank 's governor , Yasuo Matsushita , supported the proposed reforms in public , in private its officials were disappointed at how little independence the measures would actually bring . Officials from the finance ministry would still be able to attend discussions of the bank 's policy board ; the government would be able to postpone centralbank decisions ( it did not say for how long ) ; and the report did not address the question of whether the ministry would still have control over the bank 's budget .

With the solid backing of his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and at least a third of the parliamentary opposition, he can expect to muster an overwhelming majority on practically any issue that concerns him. In many ways, Mr Hashimoto's government is as robust as the one led by his former mentor, Noboru Takeshita, almost a decade ago. The only thing that could lay it low is a scandal-such as the Recruit ""shares-for-favours"" case that overwhelmed the Takeshita government. Over the past few weeks, a scandal that may prove as serious has begun to swirl around the Hashimoto government's feet. 
The problem is centred around Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW). In the old days, this would have been an unlikely school for scandal. It was the big spending ministries, like construction, where the money-and the bribes-sloshed around. But with the ageing of the Japanese population, there is now big money in health care. In an effort to encourage the construction of old-people's homes, the central government has been offering subsidies of up to 50% of the cost of construction, with a further 25% to be paid by local governments. All that needs to be done is to convince local welfare authorities that a government-subsidised institution is needed. Altogether, some Y9 trillion ($8 billion) in subsidies are available. 
One man tempted by the scale of the largesse on offer was Hiroshi Koyama, the owner of a company that operates old-people's homes. Angling for subsidies of over billion to build four nursing homes, Mr Koyama has been accused of greasing the palms of bureaucrats who could help with the approval process. He was arrested on November 18th along with Shigeru Chatani, a 39-year-old former ministry official. All told, some seven health and welfare officials are currently under investigation-and the pool continues to widen. There is much speculation that thorough investigation will lead inexorably to the ranks of senior politicians. 
The biggest fish caught so far is Nobuharu Okamitsu, who resigned from his post as administrative vice-minister (senior civil servant) at MHW on November 19th, following allegations that he had been bought membership in a golf club worth Y16m by Mr Koyama and handed Y60m to help buy an apartment. In a melodramatic pre-dawn press conference, Junichiro Koizumi, the new health and welfare minister, who has a reputation for bureaucratbashing, announced that he may well take punitive action against Mr Okamitsu. 
The irony is that Mr Okamitsu was appointed to the ministry's top job in order to clear up the mess left by the last scandal there, when civil servants allowed the continued sale of HIV-tainted blood, with fatal results. He was also the author of a book on welfare in which he wrote: ""Public expenditure is not rain from heaven, but sweat from the taxpayers' brow."" Quite.

Although a decision was postponed earlier this year, both the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, and his new telecommunications minister, Hisao Horinouchi, want NTT's fate decided as soon as possible, preferably before the year is out. But the proposed merger of Britain's BT with America's MCI has thrown the debate into confusion. 
One option, championed by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, is to copy what happened to ATa,T in America in 84. Under this proposal, the world's largest telephone company would be split into two regional domestic carriers and a longdistance one, which would then be free to enter the international market from which the giant is presently barred. The strategy would eliminate cross-subsidies between NTT's local and long-distance operations. It might also-although America's experience is not encouraging here-bring some transparency into the charges NTr makes for access to the local telephone network, which most complain are too high. 
But there are several drawbacks to a split. NIT claims that the administrative costs would be high, at V450 billion ($4 billion). More compelling is the fact that, as America found, replacing a national monopoly with several local ones achieves only half the benefits of competition: longdistance charges remain inflated by the fees firms must pay local carriers to deliver their calls. For Japanese politicians and bureaucrats, a third argument has the greatest force. In the wake of the deal between BT and MCI, which created the first of what are expected to be several global ""supercarriers"", it seems perverse to make Japan's telecoms giant smaller. 
For all these reasons an alternative method of dealing with nr's dominance has been gaining ground. It is championed by a telecoms sub-committee of the Economic Council, an advisory body to the prime minister. Tsuruhiko Nambu, an economics professor at Gakushuin University, and the sub-committee's chairman, argues that NTT should remain intact and that it should be allowed into the international market; that Japan's entire telecoms market should be flung open; and that a tough, independent regulator should decide how much NTT could charge other companies for access to its local customers. 
The committee's report is due to be presented to the prime minister on December 3rd. Its recipe is closer to Britain's model, which left BT intact and exposed it to growing competition. For this solution to work, though, everything depends on the ferocity of the regulator. Britain's Don Cruickshank, who has recently visited Tokyo, has had a weary battle to force competition on BT. After 12 years of this, the giant still has 9o% of the British domestic market. 
In Japan's case, NTT's domestic competition comes from other long-distance firms and from mobile telephone companies (the largest of which it owns). The mobile market is booming-and with it NT-r'S operating profits. The access charges mobile-telephone firms pay NTT to connect their calls help explain its 38% leap in earnings, to V245.4 billion, from the first halves of the previous and current financial years. 
But the brunt of the decision about nrz-r's future will be felt by Japan's three existing international carriers, particularly the biggest, Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) which once had a monopoly. One way or another, Nfl will be allowed to enter the international market. 
The three are already struggling: in contrast to NTT's huge rise in profits, KDD'S Operating profits fell by 20% in the first six months of this year. KDD'S problem is its high costs. The price of international calls from Japan is twice the Asian average and fully three times that of international calls from America. Their business is therefore an easy target for the attentions of ""callback"" companies, which enable people in Japan to call abroad at the lower international rates charged in other countries. There are now more than 40 call-back firms in Japan. Their tariffs for calls to the United States are, on average, half the price charged by KDD, according to Eric Gan of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank (see chart). 
Call-back competition is still smallprobably not more than 5% of the market. But it is having an impact: on November 14th KDD announced that it wanted to cut rates by an average of 5.1%. NTI, with its familiar brand name and 6om customers, poses a much greater threat. The news that the Economic Council thought NTT should be allowed into the international market unfettered sent KDD'S shares skidding by 5.6% on November z7th alone; since the middle of August they have fallen by 40%.

In the past, there was little to be gained from irritating such a powerful ministry.

That responsibility would be handed instead to a new independent body-provisionally called the Financial Inspection and Supervisory Agency-which would report directly to the prime minister's office. A cabinet minister, it was suggested, would be in charge, not a bureaucrat. Gasps of disbelief and outrage have been reverberating around the finance ministry ever since. 
Well they might. Mr Hashimoto's cabinet is packed with bigwigs from the LDP'S various factions. Ever since the election these people have been quietly arguing that he should go slow on financial reform. Most senior members of Japan's ruling party owe their reputations for bringing home the bacon partly to their cosy relations with finance-ministry officials.

Rumours are rife about tax audits being threatened for any LDP members rash enough to advocate breaking up the ministry. 
If push comes to shove, the finance ministry would probably surrender the nitty-gritty task of examining financial institutions' loan portfolios. But it is loth to give up its far more important power of administrative guidance, which it uses daily to whisper advice into the ears of banking, securities and insurance executives.

He was one of a handful of men of towering talent who created the industrial powerhouse of modern Japan. He took Nippon Electric Company (today known solely by its initials, NEC) through Japan's period of austerity and long back-breaking hours of reconstruction, to make it one of the world's electronics giants. A story is told that, in the early hard-up days after the second world war, the determined Mr Kobayashi carried around the firm's cash in a bag to prevent it being seized by creditors. Employees would be paid in secret outside the NEC factory. 
He deserves his encomium as ""father of reconstruction"". Long before MITI,Japan's famed Ministry of International Trade and Industry, came up in 1979 with its slogan ""Information is the Future"" Mr Kobayashi had been steadily turning an equipment maker into an information-technology firm. NEC was the first Japanese firm to acquire, under licence, American semiconductor expertise. In 1963, it was the first firm in Japan to make semiconductors. 
In 1964 the lad who had started in NEC straight from university was made president of the company. He was then 57, an age when people in corporate Japan might be expected to think of retiring. But Mr Kobayashi continued to dominate NEC-and the rest of the Japanese electronics industry-well into his eighties. Even in his dotage, as chairman emeritus, showing up at his office twice a week, he continued to hold enormous sway over the business, retaining the right to vote on crucial issues. As such, he was all that is good and bad about Japanese management. 
The perils of fatherhood 
What had been good for Japan in the 1960s and 1970s had become dubious by the 198os-and positively detrimental by the 199os.A particular problem has been the way former captains of industry, Mr Kobayashi especially, cast a shadow across swathes of the economy. In some cases, the protective measures they sought while their battered industries were struggling for survival persist when they are no longer needed, imposing a costly burden on Japanese consumers. In others it is the companies that suffer, not necessarily from protection but from the inflexibility of their own ideas. 
None more so, ironically, than NEC. Two generations of managers struggled to wrestle the company free from Mr Kobayashi's version of the future. Undoubtedly, ""C&C"", the slogan he coined in 1977 to denote the convergence of computing and communications, was a nifty idea at the time. But what ought to have been little more than a fleeting observation became elevated into a corporate philosophy-a mantra masquerading as a strategy. Mr Kobayashi had a forceful manner. During the war, any colleague regarded as troublesome had been challenged by him to a sword fight. Employees of Mr Kobayashi said he promoted his ideas with the determination of a kyoso, a word usually used to describe the founder of a religion. He wrote a handful of books on cac and travelled the world preaching his gospel. NEC became a prisoner of a catchphrase, causing it to miss out on opportunities that Fujitsu, Toshiba and even stolid Hitachi quickly pounced upon. It was only two years ago that NEC began belatedly to enter the multimedia business. And, despite NEc's lauded strength in C&C, it had to buy its way in. 
Mr Kobayashi's headstrong views left the company ill-prepared for other changes. More than Fujitsu or Toshiba, NEC is still reeling from the body-blows that Japanese computer makers received at the hands of an American upstart in 1992. A decade earlier, NEC had come up with the first personal-computer design suitable for Japan, and had gone on to grab half the domestic Pc market. Even when cheap IBM-clones became the rage abroad during the 198os, Mr Kobayashi insisted that his company's rcs should use its own proprietary design. It says much for his powers of persuasion that many Japanese software firms committed themselves to producing computer programs strictly for the NEC design, and not compatible with IBM'S. In so doing, Mr Kobayashi made NEC's design the dominant standard for Japan-and thereby kept the foreign competition at bay. 
With no cheap clones from abroad to worry about and hogging 50% of the domestic market, NEC earned huge profits from selling PCs in Japan during the 198os. Then Compaq spoilt everything. In a brilliant assault on the Japanese market, the clonemaker from Texas offered PCs that sold for half the price of those of NEC. American firms such as IBM and Dell followed with lowpriced machines. Financially, NEC has suffered ever since. 
Thanks to a new generation of managers, NEC will doubtless make the painful adjustments and recover. But the company's fall from grace is a reminder of the perils of pride at the top. The vitality-sapping influence of Mr Kobayashi's outmoded view is a parable for modern Japan. That, more than anything, is what Ryutaro Hashimoto's government is now trying to change.

What had been good for Japan in the 1960s and 1970s had become dubious by the 198os-and positively detrimental by the 199os.A particular problem has been the way former captains of industry, Mr Kobayashi especially, cast a shadow across swathes of the economy. In some cases, the protective measures they sought while their battered industries were struggling for survival persist when they are no longer needed, imposing a costly burden on Japanese consumers. In others it is the companies that suffer, not necessarily from protection but from the inflexibility of their own ideas. 
None more so, ironically, than NEC. Two generations of managers struggled to wrestle the company free from Mr Kobayashi's version of the future. Undoubtedly, ""C&C"", the slogan he coined in 1977 to denote the convergence of computing and communications, was a nifty idea at the time. But what ought to have been little more than a fleeting observation became elevated into a corporate philosophy-a mantra masquerading as a strategy. Mr Kobayashi had a forceful manner. During the war, any colleague regarded as troublesome had been challenged by him to a sword fight. Employees of Mr Kobayashi said he promoted his ideas with the determination of a kyoso, a word usually used to describe the founder of a religion. He wrote a handful of books on cac and travelled the world preaching his gospel. NEC became a prisoner of a catchphrase, causing it to miss out on opportunities that Fujitsu, Toshiba and even stolid Hitachi quickly pounced upon. It was only two years ago that NEC began belatedly to enter the multimedia business. And, despite NEc's lauded strength in C&C, it had to buy its way in. 
Mr Kobayashi's headstrong views left the company ill-prepared for other changes. More than Fujitsu or Toshiba, NEC is still reeling from the body-blows that Japanese computer makers received at the hands of an American upstart in 1992. A decade earlier, NEC had come up with the first personal-computer design suitable for Japan, and had gone on to grab half the domestic Pc market. Even when cheap IBM-clones became the rage abroad during the 198os, Mr Kobayashi insisted that his company's rcs should use its own proprietary design. It says much for his powers of persuasion that many Japanese software firms committed themselves to producing computer programs strictly for the NEC design, and not compatible with IBM'S. In so doing, Mr Kobayashi made NEC's design the dominant standard for Japan-and thereby kept the foreign competition at bay. 
With no cheap clones from abroad to worry about and hogging 50% of the domestic market, NEC earned huge profits from selling PCs in Japan during the 198os. Then Compaq spoilt everything. In a brilliant assault on the Japanese market, the clonemaker from Texas offered PCs that sold for half the price of those of NEC. American firms such as IBM and Dell followed with lowpriced machines. Financially, NEC has suffered ever since. 
Thanks to a new generation of managers, NEC will doubtless make the painful adjustments and recover. But the company's fall from grace is a reminder of the perils of pride at the top. The vitality-sapping influence of Mr Kobayashi's outmoded view is a parable for modern Japan. That, more than anything, is what Ryutaro Hashimoto's government is now trying to change.

A bribery case involving the Ministry of Health and Welfare is getting all the media coverage. But it is a corruption case smouldering away at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) that looks the more incendiary. 
The health and welfare row has forced the prime minister to admit to receiving a total of *7m ($62,ooo) in political donations from organisations linked to the bribery scandal. Mr Hashimoto, who had at first denied the allegations, has now apologised for being so ""careless"" and has offered to return the money. It is in fact small compared with other sums illegally changing hands at the health ministry. A former senior civil servant there, now under arrest, has admitted to receiving more than V65m from a favour-seeking businessman. 
But when it comes to putting the squeeze on business, the health bureaucrats are amateurs compared with the MITI officials who lord it over the oil industry. The scandal that is causing real anxiety throughout Nagatacho (the Capitol Hill of Tokyo) concerns an oil wholesaleing company called Izui Sekiyu Shokai. Its founder, Junichi Izui, was arrested in early November on suspicion of evading taxes on V66om out of the V4.2 billion he earned on deals with Mitsubishi Oil during 1992-94. 
Where, asked the prosecutor's office, was the undeclared money going? Aided by files they hauled off, they have established a trail leading to MITI, as well as back to Mitsubishi Oil. Mitsubishi was one of several oil companies bidding for prospecting rights in Vietnam in the early 199os. Though something of an outsider, Mitsubishi won the rights to a sector that has subsequently proved to be rich in oil. Mitsubishi received substantial assistance in pushing its bid from MITI. Oiling the wheels, so to speak, were a number of officials within MITI, who had been lavishly entertained by none other than Mr Izui. 
Shinji Sato, the new trade minister, was so concerned about corruption at MITI that he cancelled his trip to the World Trade Organisation meeting in Singapore this week. Instead he spent his time interrogating 130 senior officials. No fewer than 42 of the officials were found to have been on the take. Six of MITI'S senior career bureaucrats have been reprimanded, and the top civil servant has received a pay cut for doing a lousyjob. 
But not all of Mr Izui's Y66om slush fund was used to lubricate officials at MITI. Indeed, the authorities now suspect that much of it, and other money, was handed back to Mitsubishi and used to pay for political favours higher up. For instance, the person who put in a good word for Mitsubishi during the bidding process in Hanoi in 199o was the late Michio Watanabe, a senior Liberal Democrat politician with a wealth of useful contacts in Vietnam. Mr Watanabe was the deputy prime minister and foreign minister at the time. 
To date, nine LDP members of the Diet-including Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the finance minister, and Taku Yamasaki, the party's policy boss-are known to have accepted political contributions from Mr Izui. Bloodhounds in the prosecutor's office are now sniffing the money trail up the hill to the Diet. Having high-ranking bureaucrats on the take is bad enough.

""It is truly regrettable that the agreement will surely damage consumers' interests,"" fumed Takeo Inokuchi, the chairman of the Marine & Life Insurance Association of Japan, on December 15th. ""We question the agreement because it is . . . at the expense of the business interests of Japanese non-life insurers."" 
The agreement that has infuriated Mr Inokuchi was an insurance deal between America and Japan on December 14th, the day before an American-imposed deadline. This would, in the words of a gushing American press release, ""dramatically deregulate the Japanese insurance market."" For once this was not hyberbole: business will become much tougher for Japanese non-life insurers. But for consumers, the price of insurance will come down. 
The Americans have been trying to batter down the door into the Japanese market since 1993, so far with limited success. Of the Y6.32 trillion ($66.8 billion) paid in non-life premiums last year, foreigners collected just Y134 billion. Why have their efforts borne fruit now? Many deadlines have, after all, come and gone. This time, though, the deal bears the stamp of Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister. In early November, Mr Hashimoto promised a financial ""Big Bang"" to resuscitate the country's ailing financial markets. Many Americans did not believe him. They were wrong. The agreement was probably as surprising to American negotiators as it was unwelcome to the big Japanese insurance companies. 
The foreigners are already in Japan, but have been unable to compete by offering cheaper insurance. Premiums are set by a supposedly independent body, overseen by the finance ministry. Its aim is not to give consumers a good deal but to keep even the duffest Japanese insurance firms in business. Although premiums may be set 10% above or below the rate established by this body, in practice the cartel is so strong-five firms control more than half the market-that rates do not vary. Uniquely among insurance firms in rich countries, Japanese insurers actually make money writing policies. (Elsewhere firms typically lose money on policies but make it up from investing premium payments until they have to pay claims.) 
For how much longer? Car insurance accounts for half of the revenues in the nonlife sector. From next September insurers will be able to set premiums on car insurance freely. Those with the lowest costs and most accurate way of assessing risk will win out. Japanese insurers not only have high overheads-the big five have 270,ooo salespeople-but heavy regulation means that they also lack the skills for pricing risk. Foreign firms such as AIG and Cigna, both from America, have neither handicap. AIG'S Japanese subsidiary, for example, has sold policies by telephone since early December, with prices to% below the official rate. The price is expected to fall further once other government restrictions are removed. 
The effects on Japan's insurance market will be dramatic. At the moment, points out Paul Heaton of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, an investment bank, an 18-year-old boy racer would pay about the same insurance as his dad, who keeps his car in a garage all week and takes it out for an occasional spin at weekends. With more accurate pricing of risk, boy racers will pay more but overall premiums will fall sharply. Unless they get their act together, Mr Heaton reckons, the biggest insurers may see their profits fall by anything up to 60%. 
Japanese insurance firms think that differentiating insurance premiums according to risk is wrong. They say that some youngsters might not be able to pay more for their car insurance. Perhaps; but the truth is that teenagers are riskier than their parents. And accurate pricing of financial risk in Japan is crucial to a healthier financial system-whatever the country's insurance companies say.

IT HAS not been an easy start to the year for Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister. Since December 17th his government has been embroiled in a terrorist siege, thousands of miles away at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Peru; more than 7o hostages are still being held, some of them Japanese. Back home Japan's 125m people are far more worried about economic matters, and with good reason: the world's second-largest economy appears to be heading downhill again after an upward spurt at the start of 1996. Mr Hashimoto's government is being blamed for being too slow to deregulate and too fast, in its budget for 1997-98, to raise taxes. The Tokyo stockmarket has been tumbling, and so has the yen. And this is hardly surprising, say most pundits-Mr Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period, was never likely to make the sort of radical changes the country really needs. 
Yet that judgment would be both unfair and premature. Unfair, because since October 20th when Japan's election returned Mr Hashimoto and his party to government the prime minister has in fact been a surprisingly bold and enthusiastic reformer. Many of his proposals have yet to become law, but the signs are that Mr Hashimoto is going to shake up the bureaucracy and deregulate the economy far more than most people expected (see pages 19-21). The judgment would be premature not only for that reason but also because this process of deregulation and governmental change is directed at the long term, not the short. And that process is of international importance: it could make the difference between a Japan that is vibrant, confident and outward-looking, and one that is sluggish,jittery and parochial. 
A matter of self-interest 
Why should Japan make radical reforms? And why should Mr Hashimoto be the man to make them? The second question is the simpler to answer: because public opinion is pressing for reforms, and Mr Hashimoto knows that if he fails to deliver he will hand the fragmented opposition an ideal flag around which to rally. His party fell just short of an overall majority in parliament in October, so he needs the support of some tiny parties and knows that a fresh election may not be far away. He and his party have a selfish interest in change. There is nothing wrong in that. So does Japan. 
There is a basic difference between this bout of reform and the many waves of ""market-opening"" that Japanese governments have announced over the past decade or more. It is that those waves occurred chiefly because of foreign pressure. Today's clamour for reform has nothing to do with American trade negotiators or other foreigners. It is entirely a domestic affair. And it is arising for two quite different reasons. 
The first is purely pragmatic. Most areas of Japan's economy are intensely competitive, with Toyota slugging it out against Nissan, say, or Matsushita against Sony. Some, however, remain tightly regulated, with monopolies or oligopolies protected against new entrants, whether Japanese or foreign. This keeps prices high and discourages innovation. While the rest of the economy was booming, few people worried about this. Now, however, Japan has had four lean years; the next four look modest at best; and over the horizon can be seen the heavy burden on taxes and pensions likely to be imposed by the rapid ageing of Japan's population. 
This has focused minds on the fact that many of the most protected, highly regulated sectors produce inputs for other companies and so their high prices make everyone suffer. This is particularly true of areas such as telecommunications, air transport, road freight, and wholesale and retail distribution, but it also applies to agriculture and construction. Opening these areas to competition and innovation would lower prices and generate new jobs and activity, just as it did in the 1980s in America and Britain. Those who would lose from deregulation are bound to oppose it, fiercely. Now, however, there is a wider interest in overcoming that opposition. Mr Hashimoto has made a good start in exploiting that interest, but he has a long way to go. 
The second reason is philosophical. For years, decades even, most Japanese have believed that although politicians may be corrupt or incompetent, bureaucrats could be relied upon to save the day. Bureaucrats were hardly thought of as civil servants; more like civil masters, really. That is changing. The combination of a long-drawn-out recession and of frequent revelations of bureaucratic dishonesty and corruption mean that today's favourite sport, in politics, the media and among the public at large, is bureaucrat-bashing. The state apparatus is no longer seen as the solution to problems; it is seen as part of the problem. 
In this lie both opportunities and threats. Opportunities, because recalcitrant officials will be less able to obstruct the deregulation that Japan needs. Many bureaucrats now support economic deregulation. But threats, too, because it is important in any democracy that there is a basic confidence in the institutions of government, and that is what Japan has lost. To restore it, Japan needs laws to enforce more openness on its ministries and to put checks on bureaucrats' power to make up rules as they go along. Such reforms, like those for economic deregulation, look easier in theory than they are in practice. It will take a bold prime minister to achieve them.

""NOBODY bashes Japan any more; Japan is nothing to anyone,"" laments Isao Nakauchi, the boss of Daiei, Japan's biggest retailer. An exaggeration perhaps, but not much of one. Gone are the heady 198os, when Japanese companies seemed unstoppable; when, briefly, backof-the-envelope calculations suggested Tokyo's land was worth more than the whole of America; when some Japanese and western commentators opined that Japan had developed a form of capitalism newer and better than that practised elsewhere. 
All this now smacks of hubris. Seven years after the bursting of the stockmarket and property bubbles, Japan's economy is still struggling. GDP fell in the second half of 1996, a period of strong world growth. So did Tokyo's stockmarket. Since 1992, America's GDP has expanded by a cumulative 22%,Japan's by 6%. 
Can Japan bounce back? It has tried everything. Throwing public money at the economy succeeded, in 199296, in moderating the slump but it is now incapable of generating sustained growth. Nor, any longer, can Japan export its way out of trouble. In desperation, politicians and some bureaucrats seem to be embracing an idea they have paid lip service to for years: that the only way to get the economy moving is to cut bureaucratic control and deregulate. 
In his first speech to parliament after retaining the prime ministership in October 1996, Ryutaro Hashimoto promised sweeping reforms and big reductions in the number and power of ministries. ""It is clear,"" says the new trade and industry minister, Shinji Sato, ""that the current Japanese economic system, which supported the half-century of economic development following world war two, has reached its limit."" 
Well, politicians have been saying this sort of thing for years. What is different now? The short answer is that this time there is more than waffle. In mid-November, for example, Mr Hashimoto said that Japan's financial markets, like Britain's ten years earlier, would get a ""Big Bang""; by zoot broking commissions are to be liberalised, and the walls separating Japan's compartmentalised financial industry torn down. The aim is to reverse the longterm decline in the share of GDP contributed by the financial sector. 
Barely three weeks later, the prime minister declared that the finance ministry, Japan's most powerful bureaucracy, would be stripped of its powers to supervise financial institutions. The ministry has been shamed by its bungling of Japan's banking crisis. Supervisory powers are to be transferred to a new independent body reporting to the prime minister. In mid-December, Japan said it would deregulate insurance, one of the most closely controlled bits of the economy and the subject of a protracted trade row with America. Insurance premiums, which are presently fixed will, except in life insurance, be deregulated; insurers will be able to determine their own rates. 
The financial sector is not alone. At the moment, in the domestic airline business, would-be carriers have to get permission for every route from the Ministry of Transport, which sets fares and the number of seats available. The ministry has refused to allow newcomers into the business. Now, it seems willing to countenance some competition. The day after Mr Hashimoto announced his financial Big Bang, Skymark, a discount airline, set up shop-the first new airline allowed for more than 40 years. 
As with airlines, so with telecoms. In December, the government decided to restructure nTT, the world's biggest telephone company. For the first time NTT will be allowed to offer international calls; in return KDD, Japan's erstwhile state-owned overseas telephone company, and the two other private international telephone firms will be allowed into the domestic market. 
A Japan that can say ""Help"" 
It is a long list and shows that something is genuinely going on: reform is not just talk. Still, the fact of reform is one thing, its real significance another. Japan's economy, after all, though competitive in most areas, remains extensively regulated in parts. There is a lot to do. Are the reforms undertaken or promised so far just piecemeal change, confined to areas where movement can no longer be avoided? Or are Japanese politicians to be taken seriously when they claim the reforms are an attempt to overhaul the entire system of economic management in modern Japan? 
A conclusive answer is not yet possible but there are reasons for thinking that, with a couple of qualifications, the process is more likely to prove a bold overhaul than a modest tinkering. The first qualification is that the government has made life more difficult for itself by its fiscal stance. In the budget for 1997 (unveiled on December 25th) government spending is to fall only slightly in real terms and rise in nominal terms. True, government borrowing will be cut, but only because taxes will rise. The government is still not resisting all old-style porkbarrel temptations: it will allocate V34 billion ($295m) to new bullet-train lines likely to lose money. 
A second qualification is that anti-competitive measures could slip through and blunt the deregulatory edge of reform. Consider NTT. The company will not be broken up. Rather, it will become two local firms and one long-distance one, with shares in all three being held by a holding company. Unless the regulator is tough, there is no obvious competitive advance there-and in one respect it is a backward step. In order to push NTS restructuring through, a ban on holding companies, in force since 1947, will have to be overturned. The ban was originally imposed to promote competition by breaking up the monopoly powers of the zaibatsu, conglomerates which once dominated Japanese industry (zaibatsu were controlled by holding companies). Permitting the return of the old ownership pattern, some people fear, could allow back an excessive concentration of power-though the danger is smaller now that Japan's economy is huge and sophisticated than it was when the economy was small and immature. 
Why reform could bite 
That said, there are three reasons for thinking reform could end up changing the economy for the better. The first is that it will be hard to restrict the scope of reform now it has started. Change one thing in Japan and you start changing many others. 
At the moment, companies may fire people only if there are ""reasonable grounds""-a provision usually interpreted to mean ""if the company as a whole is losing money"". If a firm is in profit overall, it cannot fire workers from loss-making divisions. The introduction of holding companies would enable bosses to redefine lossmaking divisions as separate firms from which redundancies would be possible. 
That is not all: holding companies would also require a change to Japan's tax system. At the moment, profits in one company may not be offset by losses in another. Holding companies need to be able to do this, so Japan will have to introduce consolidated taxes, which it plans to do by 1998. In short, the restructuring of NTT could lead, through holding companies and consolidated taxes, to a wider restructuring of corporate Japan, largely, though not entirely, for the better. 
The second reason for thinking reform could be swift and thorough is that there appears to be nearconsensual support for it among the great and good. At the end of November, in the space of a week, three committees came out with deregulatory proposals. One set up by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) submitted 133 proposals. The Economic Council, which advises the prime minister, produced a list of six areas for reform. And the Administrative Reform Committee, set up at the end of 1994 in the prime minister's office, argued for accelerated reform in 13 areas. 
Of these, the Economic Council was the most radical. It demanded the easing, then scrapping of building restrictions to loosen up the property market. It wanted to throw open telecoms to all entrants. It called for an end to many of the rules that make shipping and road haulage two of the country's most regulated and corrupt businesses. It recommended the abolition of restrictive laws affecting employment agencies. Behind such proposals lies an intellectual revolution: almost all decision makers agree that change must come. 
The third reason for taking seriously Japanese politicians' professions of radicalism is that-to be blunt-they have little choice. Reform looks like their only chance to reinvigorate the economy. Apart from the bubble years of the late i98os, Japan's economic growth has been slowing since the early 1970s (see chart). In the past five years such meagre growth as it has achieved has derived mostly from the V33.6 trillion ($3oo billion) of reflationary public-spending packages. The biggest of these, in 1995, pumped a massive Y9 trillion into the economy, equivalent to almost 2% of GDP. 
The economy duly surged by 8.4% in the first quarter of 1996 but, in confirmation that such a stimulus can now be nothing more than the shortest of short-term fixes, GDP shrank in the second quarter. Most economists think the economy will grow by only 1.5% in 1997. Some think even less. 
What to do? Exports are not a solution. Even if a massive export drive were possible (which, given the shifting of manufacturing abroad, it may not be), such a drive would be politically unthinkable: no one in Japan wants more trade rows with the United States. 
Interest rates are at rock bottom (the discount rate is just o.5%); they cannot be reduced further. The government's finances are in a dreadful mess. Public debt has been soaring for the past five years and the government is desperate to tighten fiscal policy to restrain it. That will do nothing to boost economic growth. 
So what is left? If fiscal and monetary tools are not available, if exports will not soar, if the cost of capital cannot be cut, then the case for deregulation grows ever stronger. True, it is an odd instrument to use to jump-start a stalled economy. It changes an economy's structure and takes years to make its full impact.japan's immediate problem is at least partly a cyclical short-term matter, with consumer confidence, banks and companies still suffering the after-effects of the bust of 1991-92. Nevertheless, even if deregulation will not dramatically increase next year's growth, there. is little doubt that it is needed-and will benefit the economy considerably in the long term. 
The price is wrong 
Contrary to rumour,Japan is not a planned economy. But over-regulation is a big problem, as Japan's high costs show. The cost of living in Tokyo is almost 60% higher than in New York, according to Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) Sharp, an electronics company, compares operating costs in Japan with other countries. Apart from the cost of money, everything is pricier in Japan, often dramatically so (see table on next page). 
High costs have many causes, regulation foremost amongst them. For example: 
Housing. Rules limit the amount of floor space that can be built on a plot of land to (normally) zoo-3oo% of the size of the plot Originally imposed because of the dangers of earthquakes, these ""plot ratios"" have become outdated: technological advances mean that tall buildings can be as safe as short ones. Yet Japanese cities sprawl outwards, two-storied, bidding up the cost of land. 
Distribution. Coastal shipping is a cartel; new ships cannot be built unless old ones are scrapped. It costs more to ship something from Yokohama to Hokkaido than to Los Angeles. Ports are almost entirely regulated; entry to any port businesses, such as running warehouses, is virtually closed to newcomers. It is three times as expensive to move a container in the port of Kobe as in Hong Kong. Trucking firms are controlled by a bewildering system of permits. 
Retailing. The Large-Scale Retail Store Law still makes it difficult to set up large shops. Until 1992, any firm that wanted to set up a big shop had to ask permission from existing small ones. They rarely voted to commit commercial suicide. So Japan is dominated by shops employing two people or fewer; they account for 14% of total retail sales, double the figure for America. In 1992 the law was relaxed. Anyone who wanted to open a big shop merely had to seek permission from local-government committees. The number of shops of over soo square metres has risen fast as a result. But permission for supermarkets is far from automatic: the committees that consider applications include many owners of small shops. 
How much could the ending of such rules help businesses? In some sectors, enormously. The mobile-telephone market provides an extreme example. In 1994 the Japanese were, for the first time, allowed to own, notjust rent, hand sets. In April ofthat year, there were 2.13m subscribers; twoand-a-half years later there were zom. In 1996, DoCoMo, the mobile-telephone arm of NTr, spent the equivalent of almost 0.2% of GDP on investment on mobile telephones alone. 
Not every business will do so well: there will be losers (such as some small shops) as well as winners. On balance, though, more jobs stand to be won in unshackled industries than lost in mollycoddled ones. 
The EPA, which is the main official champion of deregulation, recently estimated that the government's limited deregulatory efforts so far had contributed 1.69 extra percentage points to GDP growth each year between 1990 and 1995. This somewhat rosy analysis (which looked at the benefits of growth in the big shops, but not at the effects of deregulation on small ones) is confirmed by a more thorough study of deregulation being undertaken by the OECD. The organisation is looking at five sectors: electricity, airlines, trucking, telecoms and retail distribution. These account for between 15% and 20% of GDP in the countries in the study (America, Germany, France, Britain and Japan) The preliminary results suggest that in Japan, deregulating these sectors alone could cut prices in those areas by between to% and 2o% and boost GDP by over 6% more than it would otherwise have grown over the next ten years. Why? 
The answer is not just that these sectors are heavily regulated, but also that they provide inputs for other sectors of the economy. Deregulating them therefore has a big knock-on effect. The OECD, which is to publish the full study later in 1997, may well be underestimating how much of one. Even halving the productivity gap with the rest of the OECD would, on the OECD'Sown calculations, boost GDP by 2%-and increase real incomes by $120 billion a year. 
The case against 
The economics of reform might be unimpeachable. The reasons for adopting it might be compelling. The commitment to it of many politicians and officials might well be strong. Nevertheless, a measure of scepticism is always required when dealing with japanese politics. How large a dose is needed now? 
Mr Hashimoto is not, by nature, a radical reformer. His record after becoming prime minister in January 1996 hardly inspires confidence: big deregulatory decisions were postponed, raising suspicions about his commitment to change. Even if his reformist zeal were genuine, his ability to push through change is limited by the weakness of his office. He needs to keep the backing of party barons, some of whom, now that the LDP seems entrenched in power again, may hanker after a return to the pork-barrel politics of old. 
Moreover, the LDP relies upon the vested interests that reform would cut down to size. Some of these interests will be immensely hard to tackle, in agriculture, for example, and construction. Reformers must also cope with what critics see as an ""iron triangle"", in which politicians get bureaucrats to distribute lucrative contracts to local companies; the companies provide money to politicians, and the bureaucrats eventually land plum jobs in the companies which have distributed largesse. 
Yet these practices are increasingly getting the scrutiny and censure they deserve. Two examples have been gripping Japan of late. One involves the Ministry of Health and Welfare, whose top bureaucrat was arrested in December for allegedly taking bribes from a nursing-homes constructor. The other involves MITI, which investigated I30 of its bureaucrats for taking ""favours"" from an oil distributor; some have even been reprimanded. It is a start. 
If the past five miserable years have had a silver lining, it is the soul-searching about why Japan's economy has performed so miserably of late. ""Nobody"", says Peter Tasker, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment bank, ""thinks that the way that Japan does things is better."" The soul-searching has produced that intellectual revolution and near-consensus for reform which made the 1996 general election so dull; everyone was singing from the same hymnbook. But dull as it seems, it is this widespread agreement that could presage change. 
Japan sometimes seems to be unalterable. Certainly, it eschews change through confrontation. But often, behind the facade, a consensus can coalesce for a new way of doing things. When that happens, change can be profound. It may be happening already. By the turn of the century the Japanese economy could well look very different-and more dynamic than it looks now. ","Against all expectations , it looks as if Japan really is reforming its economy 
 "" NOBODY bashes Japan any more ; Japan is nothing to anyone , "" laments Isao Nakauchi , the boss of Daiei , Japan 's biggest retailer . An exaggeration perhaps , but not much of one . Gone are the heady 198os , when Japanese companies seemed unstoppable ; when , briefly , backof - the - envelope calculations suggested Tokyo 's land was worth more than the whole of America ; when some Japanese and western commentators opined that Japan had developed a form of capitalism newer and better than that practised elsewhere . 
 All this now smacks of hubris . Seven years after the bursting of the stockmarket and property bubbles , Japan 's economy is still struggling . GDP fell in the second half of 1996 , a period of strong world growth . So did Tokyo 's stockmarket . Since 1992 , America 's GDP has expanded by a cumulative 22%,Japan 's by 6 % . 
 Can Japan bounce back ? It has tried everything . Throwing public money at the economy succeeded , in 199296 , in moderating the slump but it is now incapable of generating sustained growth . Nor , any longer , can Japan export its way out of trouble . In desperation , politicians and some bureaucrats seem to be embracing an idea they have paid lip service to for years : that the only way to get the economy moving is to cut bureaucratic control and deregulate . 
 In Ryutaro Hashimoto's first speech to parliament after retaining the prime ministership in October 1996 , Ryutaro Hashimoto promised sweeping reforms and big reductions in the number and power of ministries . "" It is clear , "" says the new trade and industry minister , Shinji Sato , "" that the current Japanese economic system , which supported the half - century of economic development following world war two , has reached its limit . "" 
 Well , politicians have been saying this sort of thing for years . What is different now ? The short answer is that this time there is more than waffle . In mid - November , for example , Ryutaro Hashimoto said that Japan 's financial markets , like Britain 's ten years earlier , would get a "" Big Bang "" ; by zoot broking commissions are to be liberalised , and the walls separating Japan 's compartmentalised financial industry torn down . The aim is to reverse the longterm decline in the share of GDP contributed by the financial sector . 
 Barely three weeks later , Ryutaro Hashimoto declared that the finance ministry , Japan 's most powerful bureaucracy , would be stripped of its powers to supervise financial institutions . The ministry has been shamed by its bungling of Japan 's banking crisis . Supervisory powers are to be transferred to a new independent body reporting to Ryutaro Hashimoto . In mid - December , Japan said it would deregulate insurance , one of the most closely controlled bits of the economy and the subject of a protracted trade row with America . Insurance premiums , which are presently fixed will , except in life insurance , be deregulated ; insurers will be able to determine their own rates . 
 The financial sector is not alone . At the moment , in the domestic airline business , would - be carriers have to get permission for every route from the Ministry of Transport , which sets fares and the number of seats available . The ministry has refused to allow newcomers into the business . Now , it seems willing to countenance some competition . The day after Ryutaro Hashimoto announced Ryutaro Hashimoto's financial Big Bang , Skymark , a discount airline , set up shop - the first new airline allowed for more than 40 years . 
 As with airlines , so with telecoms . In December , the government decided to restructure nTT , the world 's biggest telephone company . For the first time NTT will be allowed to offer international calls ; in return KDD , Japan 's erstwhile state - owned overseas telephone company , and the two other private international telephone firms will be allowed into the domestic market . 
 A Japan that can say "" Help "" 
 It is a long list and shows that something is genuinely going on : reform is not just talk . Still , the fact of reform is one thing , its real significance another . Japan 's economy , after all , though competitive in most areas , remains extensively regulated in parts . There is a lot to do . Are the reforms undertaken or promised so far just piecemeal change , confined to areas where movement can no longer be avoided ? Or are Japanese politicians to be taken seriously when they claim the reforms are an attempt to overhaul the entire system of economic management in modern Japan ? 
 A conclusive answer is not yet possible but there are reasons for thinking that , with a couple of qualifications , the process is more likely to prove a bold overhaul than a modest tinkering . The first qualification is that the government has made life more difficult for itself by its fiscal stance . In the budget for 1997 ( unveiled on December 25th ) government spending is to fall only slightly in real terms and rise in nominal terms . True , government borrowing will be cut , but only because taxes will rise . The government is still not resisting all old - style porkbarrel temptations : it will allocate V34 billion ( $ 295 m ) to new bullet - train lines likely to lose money .

ANYONE hoping that a new year would breathe new life into Japan's stockmarket has been sorely disappointed. On December 24th the Nikkei 225 average fell by 529 points. A half-hearted rally followed. This proved short-lived. This week, in the first four trading days of 1997, the Nikkei dropped by 1,37z points to close on January 9th at 18,074. Since mid-December, it has shed nearly11.5%. 
The most cursory of glances at the fortunes of Japanese shares should make investors in the vertiginous stockmarkets of America and Europe pause for thought The Nikkei peaked fully seven years ago. Since then it has made repeated attempts at recovering, only to fall back. Its post-bubble nadir was in July 1995, when it slipped below 14,500. From then it rallied to pass 22,000 in June last year. Then it started to drift down. The drift has now turned into a slump. 
Three factors are behind the latest falls. The first is all too familiar: economists are revising down their expectations about how much the economy will grow next year. In the first half of last year, many economists (especially foreign ones) thought that Japan was at last on the road to a sustainable recovery. Yet even before the recovery moves into high gear, the government is about to tighten fiscal policy. In April the sales tax will be pushed up from 3% to 5%, an income-tax rebate will be stopped and social-security contributions will go up. With consumer spending thus choked off, the economy, which grew by around 3.5% last year (albeit mostly in the first quarter), is likely to slow to a crawl. Expectations of how fast companies' earnings will grow have been scaled back as a result, particularly in materials businesses such as steel, textiles and paper. 
Some industries also face a less familiar problem: deregulation. As competition hots up in previously protected sectors, so investors fear that profits will drop. Shares in KDD, Japan's erstwhile state-owned international telecoms company, have fallen by more than a third since August because of the prospect of competition from NT, which was previously restricted to domestic services. 
Deregulation, or at least the prospect of it, has hit shares in financial services companies the hardest. The stockmarket has responded swiftly to the announcement last November by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, of a ""Big Bang"" to shake up Japan's financial system. Shares in banks, securities firms and insurance companies have been pummelled. Excluding Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, shares in Japan's big city banks as a group are lower now than at the peak of the bad-loan crisis in summer 1992, according to David Atkinson of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. 
The only solid performers on the Tokyo market are shares in companies which are internationally competitive, such as Toyota or Honda, Japan's two biggest carmakers, or in companies whose earnings are largely immune to slower economic growth, such as railway and cigarette companies. ""People will have to get to work and they will still smoke lots of cigarettes,"" says Pelham Smithers, an analyst at ING Barings, an investment bank. 
The third reason why investors are shying away from Japanese shares is that they look expensive. Stocks in the Nikkei are trading at about 65 times the companies' expected earnings for the coming fiscal year, estimates Darrel Whitten, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. Such a multiple is justified only if earnings are likely to leap. Yet Japan is now a mature economy, and a sluggish one at that; growth in most companies' earnings will be modest. Mr Whitten thinks that, in consequence, investors are in a drawn-out process of adjusting their expectations. 
It matters for Japan's beleaguered banks how this adjustment takes place. Japanese banks count unrealised gains on their share portfolios towards the capital that they must maintain to meet international standards. With the Nikkei at i8,ooo, the capital of six of the biggest 20 banks falls below the 8% demanded by regulators. At 17,000, half of the top 20 will be undercapitalised. And if the Nikkei reaches 15,ooo, 13 of the 20 biggest banks will have no unrealised profits at all, estimates Goldman's Mr Atkinson. Further problems for the banks, in turn, will only prolong Japan's economic travails. ","Investors are realising that deregulation and slow growth do not make for a buoyant stockmarket

The most cursory of glances at the fortunes of Japanese shares should make investors in the vertiginous stockmarkets of America and Europe pause for thought The Nikkei peaked fully seven years ago. Since then it has made repeated attempts at recovering, only to fall back. Its post-bubble nadir was in July 1995, when it slipped below 14,500. From then it rallied to pass 22,000 in June last year. Then it started to drift down. The drift has now turned into a slump. 
Three factors are behind the latest falls. The first is all too familiar: economists are revising down their expectations about how much the economy will grow next year. In the first half of last year, many economists (especially foreign ones) thought that Japan was at last on the road to a sustainable recovery. Yet even before the recovery moves into high gear, the government is about to tighten fiscal policy. In April the sales tax will be pushed up from 3% to 5%, an income-tax rebate will be stopped and social-security contributions will go up. With consumer spending thus choked off, the economy, which grew by around 3.5% last year (albeit mostly in the first quarter), is likely to slow to a crawl. Expectations of how fast companies' earnings will grow have been scaled back as a result, particularly in materials businesses such as steel, textiles and paper. 
Some industries also face a less familiar problem: deregulation. As competition hots up in previously protected sectors, so investors fear that profits will drop. Shares in KDD, Japan's erstwhile state-owned international telecoms company, have fallen by more than a third since August because of the prospect of competition from NT, which was previously restricted to domestic services. 
Deregulation, or at least the prospect of it, has hit shares in financial services companies the hardest. The stockmarket has responded swiftly to the announcement last November by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, of a ""Big Bang"" to shake up Japan's financial system. Shares in banks, securities firms and insurance companies have been pummelled. Excluding Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, shares in Japan's big city banks as a group are lower now than at the peak of the bad-loan crisis in summer 1992, according to David Atkinson of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. 
The only solid performers on the Tokyo market are shares in companies which are internationally competitive, such as Toyota or Honda, Japan's two biggest carmakers, or in companies whose earnings are largely immune to slower economic growth, such as railway and cigarette companies. ""People will have to get to work and they will still smoke lots of cigarettes,"" says Pelham Smithers, an analyst at ING Barings, an investment bank. 
The third reason why investors are shying away from Japanese shares is that they look expensive. Stocks in the Nikkei are trading at about 65 times the companies' expected earnings for the coming fiscal year, estimates Darrel Whitten, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. Such a multiple is justified only if earnings are likely to leap. Yet Japan is now a mature economy, and a sluggish one at that; growth in most companies' earnings will be modest. Mr Whitten thinks that, in consequence, investors are in a drawn-out process of adjusting their expectations. 
It matters for Japan's beleaguered banks how this adjustment takes place. Japanese banks count unrealised gains on their share portfolios towards the capital that they must maintain to meet international standards. With the Nikkei at i8,ooo, the capital of six of the biggest 20 banks falls below the 8% demanded by regulators. At 17,000, half of the top 20 will be undercapitalised. And if the Nikkei reaches 15,ooo, 13 of the 20 biggest banks will have no unrealised profits at all, estimates Goldman's Mr Atkinson. Further problems for the banks, in turn, will only prolong Japan's economic travails. ",740,Japan,A29-8197,,False,,0,True

SIR-An analysis of divinity and gender has the potential to be thought-provoking. It is a pity that Karen Armstrong's article (December 21st) is not. If Ms Armstrong's point is that God transcends gender, then there is no reason to emphasise the ""feminine"" aspects of God. But if her point is to illustrate the kinder, gentler elements of monotheism, she should not muddle it with simplistic notions of gender. 
Some of the most potent deities of destruction, be they, esoteric Buddhist deities, such as Rokujison, or Hindu deities like Shiva, are ""feminine"". Ms Armstrong passes over them because they belong to polytheistic pantheons. More insight would be gained if, in fact, gender and divinity were analysed without relying upon cliches regarding so-called feminine (""redolent of peace and healing"") and masculine (""warlike"", ""full of hatred"", ""cruel"") qualities. Kyoto THOMAS CONLAN 
SIR-Ms Armstrong's article was welcome enlightenment for those of us who have struggled with and abandoned the standard western monotheist religions. Here in America, abandonment of monotheism is seen as trendy and ""new age"". But our pre-Christian and early postChristian ancestors seemed to have a better understanding of what constitutes the divine. 
I sometimes wonder if Samuel Huntington, in his ""Clash of Civilisations"", left out one of the coming clashes that may well occur here in the West: the battle of the neo-pagans (allied with the Buddhists, Hindus and others) versus the triumvirate of monotheism. Most neo-pagans that I know do not seek a battle, only acceptance. Your intellectual inquiry into the subject gives me hope that we will be successful. Arlington, JOHN GORDON Virginia SENNETT 
SIR-The capacity of Ms Armstrong to outline a universal history of religion in three pages of The Economist is remarkable. But she adorns her panorama with mistakes and misrepresentations informed by two obsessions: feminism and a resentment of Judaism. 
Ms Armstrong is preoccupied with the pronoun ""He"" in reference to God in all three monotheistic religions. Curiously, she finds consolation in the post-biblical Hebrew term Shekhinah, the presence of God, which happens to be a feminine noun. That Allah, or ""God"" in Arabic, though a masculine noun, is called alRahman and al-Rahim, or ""compassionate"" or ""merciful"" saves Islam from her criticism, for these attributes are etymologically related to the word ""womb"". Yet in the Hebrew Bible, in a central passage describing God's encounter with Moses, he is presented as follows: ""The Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth."" The word ""merciful"" here is a translation of rahum, which, like its Arabic equivalent, is related to rehem, or ""womb"". 
Ms Armstrong speaks of Israel's jealous God who demanded that the people bind themselves by a covenant to him alone. Here she fails to understand two things. The common notion of the jealous God is due to an error in translation. In biblical Hebrew, hana means ""wholly committed"" to some worthy principle, cause or objective, and not ""jealous"". As for the covenant-a central idea in the Judaic perception of the relationship between God and Israel-it is by its nature, as in English law, an agreement entered into by two parties-in this case, Israel and God. Once concluded, the agreement is binding on both. Perhaps Ms Armstrong will be more comfortable with such a democratically accepted God. Silver Spring, Maryland M. ROSHWALD 
SIR-God is, as decreed by nature and echoed in the Bible (despite some gender introduced into biblical text), female. Genesis 1: 27, which Ms Armstrong cites, says that both male and female were created in God's image. 
Life is created upon conception, a notion that both Catholics and fundamentalist Christians would accept. Now, as science tells us, all embryos begin life as females, until a genetic trick turns about half into males (hence the decorative but generally useless nipples on the male). As all humans are created female and in God's image, God must be female.

SIR-Your article on language and electronics (December 21st) was off the mark in two respects. It is not ""extraordinary"" for English, as a lingua franca, to be spoken as a second language by more people than speak it as a first. That is the very nature of a lingua franca-take Latin, Swahili, Urdu or Mandarin. Latin came to a point where it no longer had any native speakers, yet was the undisputed international language of Europe during the Middle Ages. 
Many people grow up with more than one language: a common one, and one or more specific to their region or ethnic, religious or social group. Adding English to the mix does not cause any dislocation. 
The other fallacy is that the internationalisation of English will benefit those speaking English as a first language. Anecdotal evidence already suggests that it does not, since it leads to the misconception that just because someone speaks ""your"" language, he or she thinks like you. George Bernard Shaw understood this perfectly when he referred to Britain and America as two great peoples separated by a common language.

SIR-Your haphazard leader on America's tax-exempt organisations (""Tax-exempt and loving it"", January 4th) misses several crucial points. Although it is true that the tax code could use some revision to tighten restrictions on the use of charitable organisations to promote partisan politics, America's non-profit sector is generally healthy and effective. It is built on a compact between government and citizenry. In 1938 Congress noted that ""the exemption from taxation of money or property devoted to charitable. . . purposes is based on the theory that the government is compensated for the loss of revenue by its relief from financial burden . . . and by the benefits [of promoting] the general welfare."" 
As for the percentage of American contributions that actually go to ""unambiguously good causes"", ask the nation's hospitals, universities, museums, libraries, research laboratories, homeless shelters, neighbourhood clinics and art organisations if they use the bulk of their receipts to pay fund-raisers. 
The contention that abolishing the tax deduction would not hurt charities is wrong. Preliminary results from a study commissioned by the Council on Foundations indicate that elimination of the charitable deduction under certain flat-tax proposals would not end giving, but would reduce it by a substantial amount. 
The strength of America's nonprofit sector lies in people's freedom to choose the cause they want to support. Few would agree that the government is a better steward of their generosity than the charities they sustain.

Australia's identity 
SIR-Your article on Australia (""A national identity crisis"", December 14) is an interesting and largely erudite exposition of one of this country's current debates, but it requires some further examination of the migration and racism issues it raises. 
You write that: ""most internationally minded Australians would like to play down the significance of Ms [Pauline] Hanson"", the independent MP from Queensland whose maiden speech you cite. Quite. But you then go on to perpetuate the myth that most beneficial Australian thought-processes take place in the Sydney-Melbourne Canberra triangle ""where the richer and better educated"" live. 
Your article might have more accurately pointed out that, on the conservative side of Australian national politics, most of the early rebuttals of Ms Hanson's views came from Queensland. Indeed, as state premier, I have made it clear in a series of speeches and public comments that her stance on migration and racism is thoroughly unacceptable to the state government, the overwhelming bulk of Queenslanders and most Australians. 
It is a shame that a leading opinion-former such as The Economist should, through its own ignorance of the facts, seek to tar all Queenslanders with the same brush as Ms Hanson. ROB BORBIDGE Premier of Brisbane Queensland 
SIR-Your article on Australia's cultural and economic future rightly identifies a division in Australian opinion. The push to integrate economically with Asia has been led by intellectuals and politicians in the ""paternalistic"" way you suggest. This has left public opinion lagging: at best ambivalent and at worst violentlyxenophobic. 
In 1994, as a student in Australia, I was surprised in my final year to hear my history professor tell our class that he still thought a student would find more use for French or German than any East Asian language. In the ensuing debate I voiced my feelings of cultural affinity with various groups of Asian immigrants. Having a pony tail at the time, I was told by the learned professor ""Well, you would do, with a pigtail like that."" Australia's intellectual circles still harbour oldworld loyalties.

A matter of taste 
SIR-Sake aficionados everywhere salute the excellent article in your December 21st issue (""Brewed for the gods""). But in singing the praises of jizake and the exquisite ginjos, you are a little harsh on the seishu plonk of the salaryman. 
His sake, too, is free of flavouring agents and preservatives; the major breweries got rid of them years ago. He drinks his sake hot from personal choice, not because heating destroys unde-- sirable flavours. Problems associated with fusel oil, a natural byproduct of the brewing process, were solved by Japanese chemists decades ago. 
One need not wait until October to enjoy new jizake. The year's best brews are honoured every April by the National Institute of Fermentology, and go on sale soon thereafter. Not everyone is so taken with the elite winners, however. Takeo Nihei, the founder of sake-brewing in America, was once heard to remark, ""There's no such thing as a bad sake."" 
CHRIS PEARCE International Sake Honolulu Association 
SIR-I read your article on sake with interest, as I am a sake-brewer by trade and, apparently, the only non-Japanese member of the profession in Japan. When articles such as yours appear, I am reminded of the complicated nature of sake brewing. One or two points in your otherwise competent article caught my nitpicking professional eye. 
Special sake rices are credited with lending apple, banana, orange and nut nuances. Orange is not a flavour that occurs, even in ginjo sake, but the aroma particular to such high-grade brews does contain superb fruity elements-banana, apple and melon in particular. These aromas are not derived from the sake rice variety, as your article suggests; they are produced by the metabolic action of the yeast. 
You disparage the practice of serving sake hot, observing that foul sake can be made more palatable by heating. Many fine sakes are sublime warm, but not hot. The ""ginjo boom"" of recent years is, in part, a backlash against the chemical additives which became common in the post-war years of scarcity, and it spawned as an unfortunate sideeffect the belief that good sake should only be drunk cold. This over-simplistic view is coming under scrutiny as more sake lovers rediscover the joys of okan, warmed sake. Yamatotaldashi,,

SIR-Your article on Australia (""A national identity crisis"", December 14) is an interesting and largely erudite exposition of one of this country's current debates, but it requires some further examination of the migration and racism issues it raises. 
You write that: ""most internationally minded Australians would like to play down the significance of Ms [Pauline] Hanson"", the independent MP from Queensland whose maiden speech you cite. Quite. But you then go on to perpetuate the myth that most beneficial Australian thought-processes take place in the Sydney-Melbourne Canberra triangle ""where the richer and better educated"" live. 
Your article might have more accurately pointed out that, on the conservative side of Australian national politics, most of the early rebuttals of Ms Hanson's views came from Queensland. Indeed, as state premier, I have made it clear in a series of speeches and public comments that her stance on migration and racism is thoroughly unacceptable to the state government, the overwhelming bulk of Queenslanders and most Australians. 
It is a shame that a leading opinion-former such as The Economist should, through its own ignorance of the facts, seek to tar all Queenslanders with the same brush as Ms Hanson. ROB BORBIDGE Premier of Brisbane Queensland 
SIR-Your article on Australia's cultural and economic future rightly identifies a division in Australian opinion. The push to integrate economically with Asia has been led by intellectuals and politicians in the ""paternalistic"" way you suggest. This has left public opinion lagging: at best ambivalent and at worst violentlyxenophobic. 
In 1994, as a student in Australia, I was surprised in my final year to hear my history professor tell our class that he still thought a student would find more use for French or German than any East Asian language. In the ensuing debate I voiced my feelings of cultural affinity with various groups of Asian immigrants. Having a pony tail at the time, I was told by the learned professor ""Well, you would do, with a pigtail like that."" Australia's intellectual circles still harbour oldworld loyalties.

A matter of taste 
SIR-Sake aficionados everywhere salute the excellent article in your December 21st issue (""Brewed for the gods""). But in singing the praises of jizake and the exquisite ginjos, you are a little harsh on the seishu plonk of the salaryman. 
His sake, too, is free of flavouring agents and preservatives; the major breweries got rid of them years ago. He drinks his sake hot from personal choice, not because heating destroys unde-- sirable flavours. Problems associated with fusel oil, a natural byproduct of the brewing process, were solved by Japanese chemists decades ago. 
One need not wait until October to enjoy new jizake. The year's best brews are honoured every April by the National Institute of Fermentology, and go on sale soon thereafter. Not everyone is so taken with the elite winners, however. Takeo Nihei, the founder of sake-brewing in America, was once heard to remark, ""There's no such thing as a bad sake."" 
CHRIS PEARCE International Sake Honolulu Association 
SIR-I read your article on sake with interest, as I am a sake-brewer by trade and, apparently, the only non-Japanese member of the profession in Japan. When articles such as yours appear, I am reminded of the complicated nature of sake brewing. One or two points in your otherwise competent article caught my nitpicking professional eye. 
Special sake rices are credited with lending apple, banana, orange and nut nuances. Orange is not a flavour that occurs, even in ginjo sake, but the aroma particular to such high-grade brews does contain superb fruity elements-banana, apple and melon in particular. These aromas are not derived from the sake rice variety, as your article suggests; they are produced by the metabolic action of the yeast. 
You disparage the practice of serving sake hot, observing that foul sake can be made more palatable by heating. Many fine sakes are sublime warm, but not hot. The ""ginjo boom"" of recent years is, in part, a backlash against the chemical additives which became common in the post-war years of scarcity, and it spawned as an unfortunate sideeffect the belief that good sake should only be drunk cold. This over-simplistic view is coming under scrutiny as more sake lovers rediscover the joys of okan, warmed sake. Yamatotaldashi,,

To study hard is very important"" This is not outmoded advice. The new generation will change Japan, not the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto.

The prime minister would explain the ""Hashimoto principle"" to the leaders of South-East Asia during an eight-day tour, ending with a big speech in Singapore on January 14th. With the bulk of Japan's $14.5 billion of official development assistance being poured into the region, Mr Hashimoto was assured of a friendly and polite reception. But his main proposal-to elevate relations between Japan and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (As EAN) to a summit-level forum that would regularly discuss security as well as trade and investment-met with a cool reception. 
Why? In part, because South-East Asians retain suspicions of Japan that date back to the wars of the 194os. But the real difficulty is South-East Asian apprehensions about the future, rather than the past. The ASEAN countries are reluctant to have special relations with Japan, for fear of antagonising China. Although Mr Hashimoto went out of his way to talk of the need to be on good terms with China, the SouthEast Asians fear that regular security discussions with Japan would feed Chinese fears of encirclement. So, although the ASEAN leaders spoke warmly of Mr Hashimoto's speech, the betting in both Tokyo and Singapore is that regular Japanese-ASEAN summits will not be held. 
Even the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, who has long been pushing a ""look east"" policy of more links with North-East Asia, stopped short of endorsing Mr Hashimoto's idea. He did promise, however, to discuss the question of more contacts with Japan when he meets his South-East Asian counterparts next December. 
Dr Mahathir has his own schemes. His pet project is for regular summits involving ASEAN, China, South Korea and Japan-an East Asian Economic Caucus. The Japanese, who do not want to exclude America from such a group, remain cool on the idea. So the likelihood is that the main forum for discussing security in Asia will remain one set up by ASEAN itself-the ASEAN Regional Forum, which includes Japan, America and China, as well as the European Union. The problem with the forum is that its very inclusiveness means its discussions usually seem vague or empty. 
Still, its primacy does highlight a peculiarity of Asian diplomacy. Japan's historical baggage and diplomatic uncertainty mean that it has been unable to match its economic strength with the prowess to play a leading role in shaping the region's international institutions. That role instead has fallen increasingly to the seven ASEAN countries, which are economic pygmies compared with Japan. Partly because they are seen as small and unthreatening, the ASEAN countries have been able to take initiatives that would have been much more controversial had they come from a big power-such as Japan, or indeed China. 
So, though the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum includes Japan, China, America, Australia and Canada, it has become accepted practice that every second of its summits is held in an ASEAN country. It was also ASEAN that proposed the Asia-Europe Meeting and played host to the body's inaugural meeting in Bangkok last March. The World Trade Organisation's first ministerial meeting was also held in an ASEAN country (Singapore). Ja-, pan has been largely passive in all this.

In his speech at the opening of the new parliamentary session on January 20th, Mr Hashimoto called for drastic economic reform and vowed that, in pursuit of it, he would brush aside the pleas of interest-groups. Look at the budget his government is presenting, however, and you begin to doubt his seriousness. 
No sooner were the words about fiscal rectitude out of his mouth than Mr Hashimoto was outlining the government's porkladen spending plans for the year from April ist. The Y77.4 trillion ($651 billion) budget represents a 3% increase on the current year's spending. 
Does that mean the prime minister is insincere? Not necessarily. The trouble is that, now that the government is no longer in a formal coalition, many of the rankand-file within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) believe they are rid of the need to appease their partners. Accordingly, they want to go on a politics-as-usual binge and, to preserve party unity, Mr Hashimoto has caved in to them. Hence the restoration of allocations for rice subsidies. Hence the new public-works programmes. Hence a whole network of new bullet-train routes which, by any measure, will be hopelessly uneconomic. 
Where is all the money to come from? The government will raise an additional Y7 trillion by increasing the consumption tax from 3% to 5% in April and ending Y2 trillion-worth of tax cuts introduced as emergency measures during the recession. As a result, the central government's budget deficit is projected to fall to around 3.2% of GDP next year, compared with an estimate of over 4% of GDP for the current year. Still, the gap between Japan's revenue and spending will remain Y16.7 trillion. Other figures-for instance, for the growth in national debt, and for the total public-sector deficit, which includes the liabilities of local governments and state corporationsare even more alarming. 
The deficit incurred by central and local government is now put at 7.4% of GDP by the OECD. Mr Hashimoto has sworn to cut this to no more than 3% by 2005. To cover the current shortfall, more money is to be borrowed. Including local government's liabilities, Japan will be in debt to the tune of V460 trillion by the end of next year-almost equal to the country's GDP. That will make Japan the biggest debtor nation in the world. (America's gross public debt is around 64% of GDP.)Just servicing Japan's public debt is now gobbling up 22% of the budget. That is more than the government allocates to education, science and defence combined. 
To find a solution, Mr Hashimoto has appointed a council for fiscal reform. The 3o-member group is headed by the prime minister himself and includes six cabinet ministers, four former prime ministers, and numerous members of the LDP and the two smaller parties with which it used to rule in coalition and on which it still depends in the Diet. They have to come up with ideas for laws to balance the books by June, so they can be enacted in the autumn. 
The central question is whether the prime minister's professed concern about the problem, coupled with his undoubted political wiles, will be enough to overcome the pressures from within the LDP to keep on spending as usual. The glee and ease with which politicians with vested interests have hijacked the budget are not encouraging. The current mood of bureaucrat-bashing-although important to the much-needed drive to deregulate the economy-has hobbled the finance ministry, which used to restrain the worst excesses of politicians. Faced with relentless lobbying by politicians demanding handouts for their sponsors, the finance ministry has simply capitulated. 
Its most egregious cavein has been to defer the settlement of Y28 trillionworth of liabilities left by the defunct Japanese National Railways, while giving its approval for work to start on unprofitable bullet-train lines in remote parts of the country. It was the building of ""political"" railway lines that got the railways into such a financial pickle in the first place. 
To make matters worse, the LDP is determined to introduce a Y5.2 trillion supplementary budget in the weeks ahead-""to sustain the economic recovery and prevent the stockmarket from falling further."" The rationale for this extra spending is extremely dubious, since the stockmarket's fall is largely to do with the effect of deregulation on company profits, rather than economic weakness. But LDP politicians have debts to repay to friends in the building industry, who helped finance the party's return to power. 
Meanwhile, the prime minister has to get his budget through the Diet. The opposition is firmly against both the new budget and the supplementary one. With only 240 out of the 500 seats in the lower house, Mr Hashimoto needs the support of the Social Democrats (i5 seats) and the Sakigake (two). And they are beginning to waver. In other words, by shoring up his internal support he may have undermined his external support. Realising this, the prime minister has spent the past week trying to patch over the cracks between the LDP and the parties that support it from outside the government. 
If he is skilful, however, Mr Hashimoto's political problems-in particular, the need to keep the LDP's allies within the fold-could provide him with the cover he needs to rein in spending. New warnings have just been issued to the LDP's lobby groups to show some restraint. Meanwhile, heavy hints are being dropped that extensive ""profitability studies"" of the new bullet-train proposals will be needed. It is still possible that some at least of the wilder spending plans in the budget will go, and Mr Hashimoto's reputation for good housekeeping will be restored.

THIS is a dreadful time to be a banker in Japan. Since the beginning of this year, the share prices of the country's banks have fallen by nearly 15%; since early November, by almost a quarter. Plummeting bank shares have brought down the overall market: banks account for around one-fifth of the broad, capitalisation-weighted Topix share index. This week share prices have been bouncing up and down, but so far this year Topix has fallen by 6%. 
As ever, averages hide a multitude of sins. Shares in Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, by far Japan's (and the world's) biggest, have fallen by ""only"" about one-fifth since November nth. But shares in 15 of the top 20 banks have fallen by more than a quarter, and five of these by 30% or more. 
Prices are barely higher than in 1992, when fears about banks' bad debts were at their peak. Indeed, the plunge has raised anew fears about the frailty of Japan's financial system-not least because Japan boasts seven of the world's ten biggest banks by assets. Such worries should be put in perspective: a meltdown of the banking system is hardly likely, given that the government has guaranteed the safety of the 20 biggest banks. Nevertheless, the Japan premium-the premium that Japanese banks are forced to pay to borrow abroad-is again on the rise. 
Why have bank shares fallen so much? And will they continue to do so? At first glance, the causes of the rout may look obscure. After all, investors have known for many years that the banks' balance sheets are chock-a-block with bad loans, and that there are many more bad loans than the banks admit to. Moreover, most banks seem to have been making reserves against their bad loans faster than they have been acquiring new ones. So why are investors dumping bank shares now? 
One reason is a fear that the pace of reserving against bad loans is about to slow down. This fear is partly the product of a vicious circle, because it stems from the rap idly shrinking value of the banks' own equity portfolios. 
In effect, profits on these shareholdings are a cushion against bad debts, because they can be turned into cash. Lately, banks have indeed been selling shares to help write off their bad debts. However, to maintain close relations with the companies concerned, they have also been buying some back at higher prices. As worries about banks have brought down the stockmarket, this practice makes the cushion thinner. Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, an investment bank, says that three banks-Nippon Credit Bank, Yasuda Trust and Hokkaido Takushokuhave already run out of shares they can sell at a profit. 
Another trend has also convinced investors that banks will take longer than it was previously thought to earn their way out of trouble. In the past couple of years they have made much of their money from lending to the government. Buying government bonds, with money borrowed at interest rates of almost nil, enabled the city (commercial) banks to make record operating profits in the year to March 1996 (thanks to writing off bad loans, they also made record net losses). But in the six months to September, they played this game much less skilfully: although longand short-term interest rates barely budged, city banks' bond-trading profits dropped by 96%. 
Nor is lending to companies likely to help much. Razor-thin margins show no sign of increasing. Having grown anaemically in the first half of 1996, lending shrank in the last quarter and is likely to shrink more when the government increases taxes in April. Betsy Daniels, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, expects banks' operating profits to fall by a quarter this fiscal year. 
Bad as all this is, it is not enough to explain the severity of the collapse in bank shares. Two other factors have been crucial: the announcement last November by the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, of a ""Big Bang"" to deregulate Japan's financial markets, and the banks' recent efforts to bolster their capital. 
Tearing down the walls between Japan's compartmentalised financial-services industry will increase competition and further reduce already meagre profits. It may seem odd to worry about the effects of this on the big banks. In principle, it should be easier for banks this size to muscle their way into businesses from which they are currently excluded, such as underwriting and trading equities, than for others to move onto their own turf. 
The trouble, says David Atkinson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, is that their very size is their weakness. City banks already account for almost two-thirds of the profits of the entire financial system. Non-banking businesses are thus too small to bring in much money. If, as is probable, the banks respond to deregulation by squandering huge amounts of resources on these businesses, the result will be even greater oversupply-and precious little profit. This is just what hap pened in the corporate-bond market, which banks piled into as soon as they were allowed to in early 1994. 
The second extra reason for the steep collapse in banking shares lies in a technicality: the manner in which the banks have tried to augment their core (tier one) capital by issuing equity. Because few investors want to buy bank shares while the banks are in their present miserable condition, many banks have chosen not to issue conventional equity but to sell ""convertible preference shares"" instead. These are more like bonds than shares, in that investors recover principal and (if the bank pays a dividend) a fixed rate of interest. But these shares do not count as core capital since they convert into common stock only after a few years. To try to keep investors sweet, the price at which they do so is ratcheted down if the price of the stock falls, so that investors get more shares. 
There lies the rub, Many investors, particularly American hedge funds, have no interest in the shares at all: they want only the juicy fixed returns offered by the preference shares. To lock in these returns, they have therefore sold short any shares they are likely to receive. And the lower a bank's shares fall, the more such investors are forced to sell, thus causing a vicious downward spiral. 
Now that banks' shares have fallen so far, are they cheap enough to reflect investors' fears? Thanks to the fall in the rest of the stockmarket, and thus in the value of banks' equity portfolios, probably not. Since the start of the year, the average ratio of banks' share prices to the value of their net assets (their so-called price-to-adjustedbook ratio, or PBR) has fallen only from 1.95 to 1.75, calculates Miss Daniels. 
This suggests that bank shares probably have further to fall. Many American and British banks trade at higher PBRS. For example, Citicorp, an American bank, trades at a PBR of about 3. But then it makes operating profits more than four times those of, say, Fuji Bank. Yet in the early 1990s, when Citicorp was in a similar pickle to the one in which Japanese banks now find themselves, its shares traded at a PBR of 0.5. Japanese bank shares are probably headed in the same direction, if not as far. Investors have at last realised that there is no point in paying so much for Japanese banks' assets when they generate such meagre returns. All at once, everyone wants to be rid of them, to pass them on to a greater fool. The problem, says Miss Daniels, is simply that ""there is no greater fool out there"". ","The stockmarket has delivered a damning verdict on Japanese banks. But there is probably worse to come

Why have bank shares fallen so much? And will they continue to do so? At first glance, the causes of the rout may look obscure. After all, investors have known for many years that the banks' balance sheets are chock-a-block with bad loans, and that there are many more bad loans than the banks admit to. Moreover, most banks seem to have been making reserves against their bad loans faster than they have been acquiring new ones. So why are investors dumping bank shares now? 
One reason is a fear that the pace of reserving against bad loans is about to slow down. This fear is partly the product of a vicious circle, because it stems from the rap idly shrinking value of the banks' own equity portfolios. 
In effect, profits on these shareholdings are a cushion against bad debts, because they can be turned into cash. Lately, banks have indeed been selling shares to help write off their bad debts. However, to maintain close relations with the companies concerned, they have also been buying some back at higher prices. As worries about banks have brought down the stockmarket, this practice makes the cushion thinner. Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, an investment bank, says that three banks-Nippon Credit Bank, Yasuda Trust and Hokkaido Takushokuhave already run out of shares they can sell at a profit. 
Another trend has also convinced investors that banks will take longer than it was previously thought to earn their way out of trouble. In the past couple of years they have made much of their money from lending to the government. Buying government bonds, with money borrowed at interest rates of almost nil, enabled the city (commercial) banks to make record operating profits in the year to March 1996 (thanks to writing off bad loans, they also made record net losses). But in the six months to September, they played this game much less skilfully: although longand short-term interest rates barely budged, city banks' bond-trading profits dropped by 96%. 
Nor is lending to companies likely to help much. Razor-thin margins show no sign of increasing. Having grown anaemically in the first half of 1996, lending shrank in the last quarter and is likely to shrink more when the government increases taxes in April. Betsy Daniels, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, expects banks' operating profits to fall by a quarter this fiscal year. 
Bad as all this is, it is not enough to explain the severity of the collapse in bank shares. Two other factors have been crucial: the announcement last November by the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, of a ""Big Bang"" to deregulate Japan's financial markets, and the banks' recent efforts to bolster their capital. 
Tearing down the walls between Japan's compartmentalised financial-services industry will increase competition and further reduce already meagre profits. It may seem odd to worry about the effects of this on the big banks. In principle, it should be easier for banks this size to muscle their way into businesses from which they are currently excluded, such as underwriting and trading equities, than for others to move onto their own turf. 
The trouble, says David Atkinson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, is that their very size is their weakness. City banks already account for almost two-thirds of the profits of the entire financial system. Non-banking businesses are thus too small to bring in much money. If, as is probable, the banks respond to deregulation by squandering huge amounts of resources on these businesses, the result will be even greater oversupply-and precious little profit. This is just what hap pened in the corporate-bond market, which banks piled into as soon as they were allowed to in early 1994. 
The second extra reason for the steep collapse in banking shares lies in a technicality: the manner in which the banks have tried to augment their core (tier one) capital by issuing equity. Because few investors want to buy bank shares while the banks are in their present miserable condition, many banks have chosen not to issue conventional equity but to sell ""convertible preference shares"" instead. These are more like bonds than shares, in that investors recover principal and (if the bank pays a dividend) a fixed rate of interest. But these shares do not count as core capital since they convert into common stock only after a few years. To try to keep investors sweet, the price at which they do so is ratcheted down if the price of the stock falls, so that investors get more shares. 
There lies the rub, Many investors, particularly American hedge funds, have no interest in the shares at all: they want only the juicy fixed returns offered by the preference shares. To lock in these returns, they have therefore sold short any shares they are likely to receive. And the lower a bank's shares fall, the more such investors are forced to sell, thus causing a vicious downward spiral. 
Now that banks' shares have fallen so far, are they cheap enough to reflect investors' fears? Thanks to the fall in the rest of the stockmarket, and thus in the value of banks' equity portfolios, probably not. Since the start of the year, the average ratio of banks' share prices to the value of their net assets (their so-called price-to-adjustedbook ratio, or PBR) has fallen only from 1.95 to 1.75, calculates Miss Daniels. 
This suggests that bank shares probably have further to fall. Many American and British banks trade at higher PBRS. For example, Citicorp, an American bank, trades at a PBR of about 3. But then it makes operating profits more than four times those of, say, Fuji Bank. Yet in the early 1990s, when Citicorp was in a similar pickle to the one in which Japanese banks now find themselves, its shares traded at a PBR of 0.5. Japanese bank shares are probably headed in the same direction, if not as far. Investors have at last realised that there is no point in paying so much for Japanese banks' assets when they generate such meagre returns. All at once, everyone wants to be rid of them, to pass them on to a greater fool. The problem, says Miss Daniels, is simply that ""there is no greater fool out there"".

But Tokyo itself is not going to relinquish its status as the seat of government without a struggle. 
With Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, seeing the move as a central part of his plan to halve the number of ministries and reform the country's creaking bureaucracy, the Tokyo metropolitan government has suddenly allocated Y320m ($2.6m) for an advertising campaign aimed at stopping the new-capital movement dead in its tracks. This will not be easy. Last summer, Mr Hashimoto's own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), along with the two minor parties it shared power with at the time, and backed by the leading opposition party, altered the law governing any decision to move the capital. Instead of merely explaining what an alternative city must offer, the government now has to select an actual site for a new Diet (parliament) building, Supreme Court and main ministries no later than 1998. 
A new advisory body headed by Gaishi Hiraiwa, a former captain of industry, received its instructions from the prime minister on December i9th. The council's 20 members are now tramping the country to see which of the nine prefectures offering sites is to be the lucky one. The plan calls for a start to be made on clearing the ground by 2000 so that the first Diet session can be held in the new capital by 2010. 
To find the winner, the council will use criteria laid down by a previous advisory body. This suggested that the new capital should be 60 to 300 kilometres (38 to 19o miles) from Tokyo and have enough space for a city of 600,ooo people. Using figures released by the National Land Agency in 1992, the cost of the move was put at V14 trillion, excluding money for a new airport and various road and rail links. 
Much of the previous council's thinking was formulated two years ago when Kobe had just been devastated by an earthquake that did Y14 trillion-worth of damage, killing more than 6,ooo people and making 310,ooo people homeless. Understandably, high on the panel's list was the need to move the seat of government to a place safer than Tokyo, which lies at the intersection of three seismically active zones. In 1923 an earthquake killed 142,ooo people. 
The front-runners for the new capital are up in the hills. Kobe's fatal quality was the reclaimed land and soft coastal soils that underpinned most of the city's buildings. Such foundations-to be found below much of Tokyo, too-tend to amplify an earthquake's vibrations. By contrast, buildings that stand on mountain bedrock are safer. If seismic safety is to be the prime requirement, the new capital looks like being on the hills of northern Japan. Abukuma in Fukushima prefecture is a possibility. Locals there are pushing an area that is twice the size of Tokyo, on a bullet-train route and already home to some 26o,ooo people. The betting, however, is on the hilly sites of Aichi, Gifu and Mie prefectures. All three are judged to be more convenient for people in the country as a whole. 
The thought of losing so much revenue from property taxes-not to mention many of Tokyo's freest spenders-has concentrated the minds of officials in the metropolitan government As well as starting an advertising campaign, officials have been putting the word around that moving the capital would cost every JapaneseY31o,ooo apiece. Their calculation assumes that the removal cost would be Y14 trillion and would be financed by bonds paying 5.1% annually for 60 years. In reality, land prices as well as interest rates are now half what they were in 1992 when the Y14 trillion figure was first computed. 
The critics are right about one thing, though. Moving 6oo,ooo people out of the city will not make life much easier for the 3om who will stay in the greater Tokyo area. The crowding, pollution and property prices will stay about the same. So will all the best non-government jobs.

Tokyo will continue to be the mecca for the best and the brightest. It will remain the country's centre for culture, media, education, design, entertainment, finance, technology and everything else.

AS DOGFIGHTS go, the latest trade spat between the United States and Japan could prove a bloody one. Past disputes have largely arisen when the Americans have tried to prise the lid off what they regard as Japan's hermetically sealed markets. The latest one, involving international flights, is different, not least because, for a change, it is largely the Japanese who feel aggrieved. Both sides think that they have a strong case and both say the issue must be thrashed out. On February 4th the two sides agreed to another round of talks (their last was in January) in Washington at the beginning of March. Fresh from a victorious round of trade talks on insurance late last year, the Americans are in no mood to back down. Nor are the Japanese. 
International aviation has been a bone of contention between the two countries for years. At root is an agreement foisted on the Japanese in 1952, at the end of the American occupation. This gives two American carriers (United Airlines and Northwest Airlines) broad rights not only to fly to various airports in Japan but to pick up passengers there and fly them anywhere else: what the industry calls ""beyond rights"". A third airline, Federal Express, has similar rights for cargo. 
Only one Japanese airline,Japan Airlines (Ini.), was given similar freedom to fly to American destinations (largely because it was the only Japanese airline licensed to offer international flights). And it was allowed beyond rights only from New York, with a mandatory stop in San Francisco. ""Japan has the worst bilateral accord of any country in the world,"" says Paul Smith, an analyst at HSBC James Capel, a firm of stockbrokers. 
Why has this rumbling now suddenly got worse? The Japanese have become increasingly irked by the fact that American airlines have rights so much broader than their own. This has enabled American carriers to pick up increasing amounts of the traffic between the two countries (see chart on next page). The Japanese are cross, too, about the way American carriers have used their beyond rights. Some American aircraft have been arriving in Japan almost empty, picking up passengers and whisking them to other destinations in Asia. Japanese officials think that no more than half the seats of these aircraft should be filled by people boarding in Japan. 
To ""equalise"" the relationship, Japanese officials want not only JAL but another airline, All Nippon Airways (ANA), to be able to fly to and from the same places as American carriers. They also want)apanese airlines to have the same beyond rights in the United States as American airlines have in Japan. ""We want Japanese airlines to be able to do what American airlines can do,"" says a Japanese negotiator. 
That is not, on the face of it, an unreasonable request. But the Americans have steadfastly refused to budge. Two years ago, the Japanese transport ministry therefore stopped American airlines from opening any new onward routes from Japan. The Americans cried foul. Last year the row became ugly. The Ministry of Transport refused to approve some new freight services that Federal Express wanted to offer; and America's Department of Transportation retaliated with a threat to restrict JAL's cargo services. Suddenly it even seemed possible that Japan would tear up the 1952 accord. This is the last thing anyone wants, least of all the Americans. Carrying people between Japan and the United States is a big, profitable business for America's airlines and is growing by about 8% a year. 
But what the Americans fear most is being shut out of Asia's lucrative market. The International Air Transport Association reckons that Asia's share of all air traffic will rise from a quarter in 1993 to over half by 2ooo. For the past two years Japanese travel to the rest of Asia has been rising by more than lO% a year. In the latest fiscal year, JAL took almost 20% more passengers to South-East Asia than during the year before. 
In late September, as away out of the impasse, President Clinton suggested to Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese prime minister, that the two countries reach an open-skies agreement. Under such agreements, which America has signed with a host of countries in recent years, airlines from one country can fly to anywhere in the other country, pick up passengers and take them to whichever country they choose (provided it, in turn, agrees). 
The Japanese are not exactly salivating at the prospect. Such an agreement, they think, would continue to give American airlines an unfair advantage.The Japanese claim that opening international markets without first opening the American domestic market would allow American airlines to use profits earned on internal flights (which account for more than 40% of world air travel) to subsidise their expansion beyond American shores. 
By contrast, Japan's domestic market is not only much smaller than America's, but is about to become a lot less profitable. The transport ministry is beginning to deregulate. Last November it announced that HIS, a discount travel operator, would be allowed to open a domestic airline, the first company to do so in more than 40 years. Two smaller operators have also been given the nod. On January 3oth, the transport ministry said that it would start deregulating fares and capacity in transport in the 1997 fiscal year, which begins in April. Competition will drive down the three carriers' already meagre profits. Small wonder that airlines have been the worst performers in the Japanese stockmarket over the past six months. 
Given the high price of flying in Japan (it costs as much to fly from Tokyo to Sapporo as from Tokyo to Los Angeles), the transport ministry has little choice but to start breaking up the cartel. Yet bureaucrats hesitate to expose the airlines to more foreign competition at the same time. 
Hence the two other arguments that Japanese trade negotiators wield against open skies. American airlines have managed to accrue three times as many slots as Japanese carriers to fly between Japan and the United States at Narita, Tokyo's international airport, they say, because of unfair competition. Without a redistribution of these slots to Japanese carriers, open skies would merely entrench that unfairness. A second fear is that, as a result,American carriers will capture so much travel between the two countries that they will eventually force up prices. 
For a ministry which presides over the most heavily regulated sector of the Japanese economy, that second argument sounds odd. The first has more merit. Slots are limited; both the big international airports, at Narita and Kansai, are operating at full capacity. That said, the problem is largely of the transport ministry's own making. It could have encouraged regional airports to be used as hubs. It could have decided that the extension to Haneda, Tokyo's domestic airport, which opens in April, be used for international flights. And it could increase the number of flights going into Narita which takes only 25 flights an hour, compared with, say, 40 at Britain's similarly sized Gatwick. 
Its own fault 
Above all, it could have deregulated much earlier. The fact that an American airline can fly less than half full across the Pacific and still offer cheaper flights from Japan than Japanese carriers says a lot about the effects of the present domestic cartel on the competitiveness of Japanese airlines. JAL's costs per passenger mile are 70% higher than those of American airlines coming into Japan, according to Naoko Matsumoto, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, an investment bank (see box). 
The result of all this is that, per head of population, Japan has fewer international flights and fewer available seat-miles (total seats multiplied by the number of miles flown) than any other OECD country. It also has fewer international flights than many of its Asian neighbours. Whatever the iniquities of the original deal between the United States and Japan, that has been the cost to would-be Japanese travellers of the transport ministry's attempts to cosset the country's airlines. The victims have been Japanese travellers and Japanese companies. They have most to gain from opening Japan's skies.

This time the problem is Japan's ports. These have long been nests of restrictive practices that hobble importers and shipping lines alike. The transport ministry is keen to do something about the problem, but the bureaucrats are scared of special interests such as the dockers and the cargohandling cartel. Hence the convenience of leaving the dredging work to America's Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in Washington, DC. 
The American overseer of sea-trade has spent several weary years urging the transport ministry to use its authority to sort out the ports. Now it has finally understood how gaiatsu works. From April 14th, it will levy a $100,000 surcharge on Japan's three largest shipping firms-Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Mitsui OSK Lines and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha-every time one of their container vessels docks in an American harbour. With the three Japanese lines visiting American ports over 400 times a year between them, this could cost them $40m annually. And if the authorities in Tokyo decide to retaliate-as the Japan Harbour Transportation Association has threatened to do-the FMC says it will hike the surcharge to as much as $1m a visit. 
The FMC expects Japan's flagship lines to squeal to the government-and be heard. The three shipping firms lost a combined 14 billion ($128m) last year on their North American routes. Competition from other Asian lines has cut transpacific shipping rates by 30% over the past 18 months, so the Japanese firms know that they will not be able to pass any cost increases on to customers. 
The FMC's aim, of course, is to provide the gaiatsu excuse that the Japanese authorities need to concede-after an appropriate amount of sucking their breath regretfully through clenched teeth. Already the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, has called the FMC'S decision ""very regrettable"". The transport minister, Makoto Koga, has asked the FMC to withdraw its planned sanctions, promising to make ""adjustments"" to Japanese harbour practices within three to five years. 
All good, clean, ritual stuff The only real outrage has come from Shiro Takashima, the 83-year-old autocrat who has dominated the nation's ports for the past two decades. As boss of his own stevedore company and chairman of the Japan Harbour Transportation Association, the formidable Mr Takashima has threatened to ban all American ships from Japan. 
In theory he could do it. Virtually all the vessels that carried Japan's $689 billion of two-way trade last year were given their berths on his say-so. When a shipping company-foreign or domestic-needs to change a route, a vessel or a port of call, it has to ask the harbour association six weeks in advance. If the paperwork is not perfect, approval is delayed for a month. 
Ever since the war, Japanese boat owners have learned to live with the yakuza, gangsters who infest the country's waterfronts and often dictate which firms win which contracts. But the harbour association's ""prior consultation"" wheeze is barely a decade old. It was introduced in 1986ostensibly to avert a strike by dock workers over the shift to containerisation. Masquerading as a shield for dockers' wages, the procedure is really a mechanism for reserving contracts for association members and extracting ""concessions"" from shipping firms. So far, fear of the harbour association has stopped newcomers from setting up their own cargo-handling facilities. 
The FMC thinks Tokyo's transport mandarins should do something about this. The ministry spends no billion a year upgrading harbour walls and loading bays, but seems reluctant to take on the stonefaced men who stop them working properly. Perhaps a bit of gaiatsu will give the bureaucrats the necessary spine. ","THE Japanese call it gaiatsu-using foreign pressure as an excuse for doing something that everyone agrees is necessary but no one wants to take the flak for. This time the problem is Japan's ports. These have long been nests of restrictive practices that hobble importers and shipping lines alike. The transport ministry is keen to do something about the problem, but the bureaucrats are scared of special interests such as the dockers and the cargohandling cartel. Hence the convenience of leaving the dredging work to America's Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in Washington, DC. 
The American overseer of sea-trade has spent several weary years urging the transport ministry to use its authority to sort out the ports. Now it has finally understood how gaiatsu works. From April 14th, it will levy a $100,000 surcharge on Japan's three largest shipping firms-Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Mitsui OSK Lines and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha-every time one of their container vessels docks in an American harbour. With the three Japanese lines visiting American ports over 400 times a year between them, this could cost them $40m annually. And if the authorities in Tokyo decide to retaliate-as the Japan Harbour Transportation Association has threatened to do-the FMC says it will hike the surcharge to as much as $1m a visit. 
The FMC expects Japan's flagship lines to squeal to the government-and be heard. The three shipping firms lost a combined 14 billion ($128m) last year on their North American routes. Competition from other Asian lines has cut transpacific shipping rates by 30% over the past 18 months, so the Japanese firms know that they will not be able to pass any cost increases on to customers. 
The FMC's aim, of course, is to provide the gaiatsu excuse that the Japanese authorities need to concede-after an appropriate amount of sucking their breath regretfully through clenched teeth. Already the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, has called the FMC'S decision ""very regrettable"". The transport minister, Makoto Koga, has asked the FMC to withdraw its planned sanctions, promising to make ""adjustments"" to Japanese harbour practices within three to five years. 
All good, clean, ritual stuff The only real outrage has come from Shiro Takashima, the 83-year-old autocrat who has dominated the nation's ports for the past two decades. As boss of his own stevedore company and chairman of the Japan Harbour Transportation Association, the formidable Mr Takashima has threatened to ban all American ships from Japan. 
In theory he could do it. Virtually all the vessels that carried Japan's $689 billion of two-way trade last year were given their berths on his say-so.

China is a huge land, roughly the size of the United States, and vulnerable. It cannot be defended by brute military force alone, and not just because internal threats tie up so much of that force. China's People's Liberation Army (peA) may be the world's largest, yet it is outnumbered by two to one when the armies of its seven biggest neighbours are added together, to say nothing of America's huge Pacific presence. And China's military technology is put in the shade by most of its neighbours'. 
Four-fifths of China is rugged and inhospitable, yet it is through these western frontierlands that five invasions of nomads have arrived to conquer part or all of the Chinese state, most recently until 1911. Even now only a third of China's people live in this western region, but it contains the bulk of China's mineral resources, notably oil-one reason for maintaining a large military garrison. 
Of the hinterland's sparse population, a fractious minority subsumed under earlier imperial expansion now chafes at Chinese rule. In Xinjiang, China's westernmost province, Kazakhs, Tajiks, Kyrgyz and Uighurs seek to rebuild ethnic and nationalist ties with the new central Asian republics, sometimes under a pan-Islamic banner. Recently the province has seen a spate of terrorist bombings. The risk of fresh rebellion is another reason for keeping a powerful military presence there. 
Separatist tendencies are strongest in Tibet. The government in Beijing has tried to counter them with a blend of economic development and suppression of support for the Dalai Lama. That support grew stronger as it was forced underground. Over the past decade, large numbers of ethnic (Han) Chinese have moved in to seek a new living in Tibet's larger towns, but this has failed to quell Tibetan longing for independence. Even in Inner Mongolia, where Hans now outnumber Mongols sixfold, Mongolian nationalism still has to be kept down by tough government measures. 
The least fractious two-thirds of China's population, about 8oom, live on the eastern one-fifth of its land. This is an area roughly the size of America's eastern seaboard-plus Alabama, West Virginia and Pennsylvania-but with nearly six times the population. Sheer numbers do not necessarily bring security: for a start, the region's economy remains predominantly rural, and so harder to defend. A rural campaign against the cities was, after all, how the Communists got to power. 
Nor is the coastal plain easy to defend. In the 19th century western imperial powers had no trouble invading it. Earlier this century Japan managed to wreak breathtaking brutality on this region. Today the region remains vulnerable to attack. It would be devastated by the air superiority alone of Taiwan, with which China is technically still at war. America's military strategists can allow themselves the luxury of discounting any future conflict with another power on continental American soil; China's equivalents have to assume that any such conflict would take place on their home ground. 
What of China's neighbours, of which it has no fewer than 14 with shared land borders? At least four ofthose borders-with Russia, North Korea, Tajikistan and India-are disputed. In addition, China has sea claims overlapping with Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan. China also lays claim to three ter- ritories not yet under its jurisdiction: Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. And then there is its ""sphereof-influence boundary"" across the Pacific with America, outlined by two American political scientists, Andrew Nathan and Robert Ross, in a new book* on Chinese security concerns, which this section draws on. By the authors' count, therefore, ""China's territorial interests overlap with those of 24 other governments."" China has this century been in military conflict with no fewer than seven: Russia, India, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and America. 
The strategists in Beijing will admit that China is probably as strong as it has ever been, and its borders as secure. Relations with India are improving after past bloody conflicts. Sino-Russian relations have gone from strength to strength since the collapse of the Soviet Union; until then, the 4,000mile border had been the world's most heavily armed, with 1.5m troops massed along it, backed by nuclear weapons. Last year China even signed a border agreement with Vietnam, a communist vassal-turned-foe. 
What if 
Yet, in Chinese eyes, the keenest vigilance is still called for. A nuclear-arms race might develop on the Korean peninsula, pushing Japan, China's old aggressor, to acquire its own nuclear weapons. North Korea's despot regime might yet try to divert its sullen masses with a full-scale invasion of the south, with frightening consequences for China. Trade and investment between China and South Korea would certainly be hit; and North Korean refugees would probably flood into Manchuria. In the end, though, a Korean unification is likely to be led by South Korea. Then Japan might tempt South Korea under its security umbrella. 
Further south, China has little influence over the maritime states of South-East Asia, whose economies look towards America and Japan rather than China. What if they entertain a superpower that is hostile to China? This happened quite recently when tiny Vietnam entertained two powers at once, the United States and the Soviet Union. China dreads the risk of superpower encirclement. 
In the 1950s America contained China from what Douglas MacArthur called America's ""unsinkable aircraft carrier"", Taiwan. It was this containment, along with Maoist ideology, that helped push China into its quarter-century of economic isolation. Next, China's Soviet ally turned enemy, tilting for influence in North Korea on one side of China and Vietnam on the other. This helps to explain China's invasion of Vietnam in 1979 and its support for Cambodia's genocidal Pol Pot regime: the Soviet Union was threatening to squeeze China from both her northern and southern flanks. China's warming to America was a cold-war necessity. 
For the moment, the cadre notes, Russia lies quiet in Asia, wracked by domestic troubles. Russia and Japan are in dispute over the Kurile Islands, and relations between the two countries are coolish, which suits China just fine. China also welcomes America's defence presence in the Asia-Pacific region to guard against Russian military resurgence. And America's defence pact with Japan is a useful way of preventing a new rise in Japanese militarism. If America were to withdraw from the region, it would be a disaster in China's eyes. 
On the other hand, China must keep a sharp watch for signs that America and Japan might be combining to contain or divide it. Both countries have parliamentarians who loudly deny the Chinese government's legitimacy. In this light the strengthened security agreement signed a year ago between Bill Clinton and Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, looks disturbing to the Chinese. Separately, America has talked about helping Japan build a theatre missile-defence system. Why, asks the cadre, should it do that unless it wants to encircle China? 
China's greatest concern is for territorial integrity. Hong Kong and Macau, separated from China since 1841 and 1557 respectively, are at least to return soon. Yet both Britain and America are trying to undermine the future exercise of Chinese sovereignty in Hong Kong by playing the human-rights card. After Hong Kong's return, attention will soon be turned to wooing back Taiwan by peaceful means. Yet that very attention will increase the risk that such a policy might continue to fail, as it has done so far. And if America really believes in ""one China"", as it says it does, why is it constantly intervening in Taiwan's favour? China cannot afford to give an inch on territorial issues, or else Tibetan separatists, Hong Kong liberals, Taiwanese independents and (who knows?) the man on the Beijing omnibus would take a mile. 
Satisfaction not guaranteed 
Remove the glasses, and it is clear that China's foreign policy is frantically reactive, dedicated to stopping Taiwan moving towards independence, averting fresh challenges to its territorial claims and preventing new power balances from shaping the region. China lives in dread that new power arrangements amongst China's near-neighbours will threaten its external security. Yet it palpably lacks the power to impose its views on others. So its diplomacy comes in two distinct styles: high principle and pragmatism. Under the first heading, the emphasis is on sovereignty, not open to discussion. Many visitors to Beijing have been treated to the lecture that begins: ""The whole world admits there is but one China. . . "", and ends: ""Five thousand years of history have proven that anybody who tries to divide China will be cursed for generations."" 
The second style involves cool calculations of national interest and balance of power. Thomas Christensen of Cornell University calls China the ""high church of realpolitik"". This, ironically, would have served it very well in dealing with the western imperial powers that knocked down its doors in the 19th century. Today it sets China dangerously at odds with the American-led concept that foreign policy can have legitimate concerns-human rights, self-determination-that transcend national boundaries. For now, the danger remains that China will be, as Messrs Nathan and Ross put it, ""not a satisfied power"".

1997-03-22,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224113066/fulltext/F6C0C4997A5E4BE7PQ/50?accountid=14657,"In this article, Eisuke Sakakibara argues that pessimism about the Japanese economy is overdone 
IN FISCAL 1996 (which ends on March 31st), Japan will probably have achieved GDP growth of 2.5% or more, as forecast by the government. That will be among the highest of the G7 countries. The short-term pessimism over the economy that has recently been pervasive in Tokyo and elsewhere is based primarily on two assumptions. The first is that the 77 trillion ($57 billion) tax increase in April 1997 will be a major drag on consumption and may result in a ""double dip"" recovery. The second is that the non-performing loan problems, which are worsening, may result in bankruptcy for some large financial institutions. 
Neither speculation can be supported by the facts. First, the tax increase has been anticipated for the past few years, and to the extent that consumers are rational, has already been incorporated into their consumption behaviour. Indeed, housing starts jumped substantially last September in anticipation of the consumption tax rise and have plateaued since. Additionally, there has been a small increase in automobile purchases during the past few months. True, there may be some small reactions to these purchases during the April-June quarter but those reactions will be temporary. 
What is more important is that business sentiment has been improving, reflecting continuing favourable prospects for profits. In all industries, it is now expected that profit levels will increase on average at slightly less than lO% in fiscal 1996 and 1997. Investment in plant and equipment is expected to grow substantially in fiscal 1997, reflecting the outlook for profits. I do not intend to make any macroeconomic forecast here, but I will say that achieving the 1.9% growth predicted by the government for fiscal 1997 should not prove hard. 
The writing off of non-performing loans by banks, on the other hand, is proceeding steadily and their total amount is now 29 trillion, as against 1,346 trillion of total assets. There has been some downgrading of several top banks by rating agencies as well as market rumours about financial distress at some banks during the last few weeks. But the finance minister, Hitoshi Mitsuzuka, has said that both the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan would stand firmly behind those institutions, and the market has swiftly regained its stability. Large-scale streamlining and restructuring are being undertaken by these banks, and the authorities fully back the efforts they are making to overcome their present difficulties. Indeed, the socalled ""Tokyo Big Bang"" will be implemented in the coming years to deregulate Tokyo's financial markets, and these deregulatory efforts have been carefully scheduled, with full consideration given to the process of recovery of the industry's shattered health. 
Both domestic and foreign observers have expressed some scepticism about the possibility of implementing the six broad reforms announced by the Hashimoto government. It is true that neither the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, nor his party, the Liberal Democrats, has ever been perceived as the ultimate ""reformer"". In fact, both have been seen as somewhat nationalistic and often conservative. 
But the history of reform is surprising: it has often been tough conservatives who have implemented genuine reforms. Edmund Burke spoke of radical reform to preserve nationhood, and it is exactly that type of reform that the Hashimoto government has set about implementing. I, for one, have long defended the Japanese-style market economy, and my position remains unchanged. Job security, harmony within society, and co-habitation with nature should still be the cornerstone of the Japanese economy and society. However, we must adapt to the ever-increasing trend toward globalisation and quickly adjust our system in order to survive in this new environment. As we have done for the 130 years since the Meiji Restoration, we will quickly absorb what needs to be absorbed and become fully competitive with the AngloSaxon and other systems. 
In sectors such as automobiles, semiconductors, and machine tools we are still fully competitive. It is in areas such as finance and information that we need to concentrate our efforts to catch up. 
The Tokyo Big Bang is a series of reforms to restructure our financial system and institutions to achieve such goals in the area of finance. During the current session of the Diet (parliament), a bill will be enacted to deregulate cross-border and cross-currency financial transactions completely. That act would transform the international financial field in Tokyo. Following foreign-exchange deregulation, blueprints to deregulate or internationalise areas such as securities, banking, insurance, business accounting standards, and taxation should be announced by the end of 1997. Most of the changes should be enacted, where legal action is necessary, in the normal session of the Diet between January and June 1998. Mr Hashimoto has said the Tokyo Big Bang will be completed by 2001, but the process is likely to be quicker than that, with most of the necessary measures in place by the end of the century. 
The lessons of Asian history 
Some of the irrational pessimism currently pervading Japan seems to be the result of an identity crisis to which many Japanese have fallen victim since the end of the cold war and the achievement of Japan's goal of catching up with the West. Until quite recently, Japan could easily identify itself with the free non-socialist world, despite historical and cultural differences, and could concentrate on economic activities. 
However, with the end of what Samuel Huntington, a professor at Harvard, calls the civil wars among the western powers, a new perspective on the world scene that places greater emphasis on differences between civilisations has emerged-and many Japanese who have had a few qualms about Americanising their way of life in the search for economic prosperity have suddenly lost their confidence now that they have achieved what they thought was their goal. Some confusion has naturally been generated and a serious search for national identity has ensued. 
In order to understand the nature of this search-and to grasp its implications for modern Japan-it is necessary to look at some recent trends in Japanese historiography. Serious soul searching has been going on for some time now, particularly among philosophers, anthropologists, economic historians, and among Asian regional specialists. Many have taken a long, hard look at Japanese history before the Meiji modernisation in the 19th century and Asian history before westernisation. 
Influenced by the writings of Fernand Braudel and Immanuel Wallerstein (historians who helped establish a tradition of global comparative history), large numbers of Japanese intellectuals are beginning to realise that a global economic system existed in the areas around the Indian Ocean, the Arabic Sea, the South China Sea, and the East China Sea long before the westernisation of the world. The Mediterranean world sketched by Braudel and the world system across the Atlantic Ocean described by Wallerstein were nothing other than subsystems of the global system that encompassed Africa, the Mediterranean, the Islamic Middle East, India, China, and Southeast Asia. 
The centre of world economic and commercial activity from about the eighth and ninth centuries until around the dawn of the i8th century was the area encompassed by the Islamic empires, India, Southeast Asia and the coastal areas of China. In the 15th and i6th centuries, Europe entered this global commercial network. Europeans imported enormous amounts of consumer goods, ranging from cotton products, tea, and ceramics, to lacquerware and seasonings such as pepper and cloves. They exchanged those goods for silver and gold which they obtained from North and South America. 
The key to this global economic system was the importance placed on commercial activities by Islamic merchants. Around the time of the Abbasid dynasty, cross-border trade became extremely active in the Islamic world with merchants acting as mediators for the movement of goods among western and African countries, India, and (later) China. Joint business operations resembling modern corporations thrived. Islamic, Jewish, and other merchants travelling on dhows-wooden ships with triangular sails-had reached as far as the southern coast of China as early as the 11th or 12th century. Chinese merchants sailing on junks reached Calcutta and other Indian ports on the Bay of Bengal sometime between the 12th and 14th centuries. 
It is true that Venetian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and English merchants participated in this global trading network. But compared with their Islamic, Indian, and Chinese counterparts they were latecomers, originally interested in importing luxury Asian goods for the European nobility and bourgeoisie in exchange for wool and woollen products or silver and gold. 
Admittedly, the Industrial Revolution, which began in Europe in the late 18th century, and European superiority in firearms, have shifted the balance towards the West over the last zoo-odd years. However, according to the new view emerging among Japanese intellectuals, Asia has a long tradition of global trade among countries with diverse cultures and religions. What we are witnessing now is the ""Asian Renaissance"", born of the fusion of Asian commercial globalism and western capitalism. 
Owing to geography, Japan found itself at the periphery of the Asian global trading network, and precisely because of this peripheral location it has been able to retain its independence throughout its history. In this sense, Japanese history resembles that of western Europe, particularly England, in that the nation was never trampled under by the military aggression of the Chinese, Mongolian, or Islamic empires. Japan was late in developing its economic system compared with other Asian and Islamic countries. 
Unlike economic historians of the past, Japanese Braudelians and Wallersteinians claim that Japan's modernisation had proceeded fairly steadily before the Meiji Restoration of 1868. They claim that levels of productivity, education, and culture during the 17th and i8th centuries in Japan were comparable to those in Europe. In explaining the rapid increase in agricultural productivity during the Edo period (1605i868), they introduced the concept of an ""Industrious Revolution"" (increase in labour productivity by independent and relatively entrepreneurial farmers); this was conceived as a counterpart to the Industrial Revolution of the West. 
Of course, some catching up was necessary in order to revolutionise production ""industrially"" and to equip a modern army. But the infrastructure of modernity, according to the new view in vogue among Japanese intellectuals, was already there. 
Japan as model 
The implication of all this historical work is as follows: the pivotal question facing Asia and Japan today is not an all-or-nothing choice between globalisation western-style or receding into a pre-modern and backward tradition. Rather, the question is how Asian countries can help create a new global system along with the West. 
Many aspects of western market capitalism need to be incorporated into the new system, and in this context reform-perhaps even revolutionneeds to be implemented quickly. However, this does not imply that the traditional elements of the Asian economic structure-family and regional ties, or what Francis Fukuyama, of George Mason University, called the ""trust"" network-need to be changed. Rather, the ""Asian Renaissance"" may well create a new paradigm, one that is different from western individualism or laissez-faire capitalism. In such a paradigm, it is likely that there will be an important role for Japan, because it is both part of Asia and a nation that has succeeded in modernising its system without fundamentally losing its culture and religion. In other words, the sun may well rise again in the 21st century, with Japan not emulating the West but instead playing a leadership role in the effort to fuse modern western capitalism with pre-modern but nonetheless well-developed Asian global commercialism. ","In this article , Eisuke Sakakibara argues that pessimism about the Japanese economy is overdone 
 IN FISCAL 1996 ( which ends on March 31st ) , Japan will probably have achieved GDP growth of 2.5 % or more , as forecast by the government . That will be among the highest of the G7 countries . The short - term pessimism over the economy that has recently been pervasive in Tokyo and elsewhere is based primarily on two assumptions . The first is that the 77 trillion ( $ 57 billion ) tax increase in April 1997 will be a major drag on consumption and may result in a "" double dip "" recovery . The second is that the non - performing loan problems , which are worsening , may result in bankruptcy for some large financial institutions . 
 Neither speculation can be supported by the facts . First , the tax increase has been anticipated for the past few years , and to the extent that consumers are rational , has already been incorporated into their consumption behaviour . Indeed , housing starts jumped substantially last September in anticipation of the consumption tax rise and have plateaued since . Additionally , there has been a small increase in automobile purchases during the past few months . True , there may be some small reactions to these purchases during the April - June quarter but those reactions will be temporary . 
 What is more important is that business sentiment has been improving , reflecting continuing favourable prospects for profits . In all industries , it is now expected that profit levels will increase on average at slightly less than lO% in fiscal 1996 and 1997 . Investment in plant and equipment is expected to grow substantially in fiscal 1997 , reflecting the outlook for profits . I do not intend to make any macroeconomic forecast here , but I will say that achieving the 1.9 % growth predicted by the government for fiscal 1997 should not prove hard . 
 The writing off of non - performing loans by banks , on the other hand , is proceeding steadily and their total amount is now 29 trillion , as against 1,346 trillion of total assets . There has been some downgrading of several top banks by rating agencies as well as market rumours about financial distress at some banks during the last few weeks . But the finance minister , Hitoshi Mitsuzuka , has said that both the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan would stand firmly behind those institutions , and the market has swiftly regained its stability . Large - scale streamlining and restructuring are being undertaken by these banks , and the authorities fully back the efforts they are making to overcome their present difficulties . Indeed , the socalled "" Tokyo Big Bang "" will be implemented in the coming years to deregulate Tokyo 's financial markets , and these deregulatory efforts have been carefully scheduled , with full consideration given to the process of recovery of the industry 's shattered health . 
 Both domestic and foreign observers have expressed some scepticism about the possibility of implementing the six broad reforms announced by the Ryutaro Hashimoto government . It is true that neither Ryutaro Hashimoto , nor Ryutaro Hashimoto's party , the Liberal Democrats , has ever been perceived as the ultimate "" reformer "" . In fact , both have been seen as somewhat nationalistic and often conservative . 
 But the history of reform is surprising : it has often been tough conservatives who have implemented genuine reforms . Edmund Burke spoke of radical reform to preserve nationhood , and it is exactly that type of reform that the Ryutaro Hashimoto government has set about implementing . I , for one , have long defended the Japanese - style market economy , and my position remains unchanged . Job security , harmony within society , and co - habitation with nature should still be the cornerstone of the Japanese economy and society . However , we must adapt to the ever - increasing trend toward globalisation and quickly adjust our system in order to survive in this new environment . As we have done for the 130 years since the Meiji Restoration , we will quickly absorb what needs to be absorbed and become fully competitive with the AngloSaxon and other systems . 
 In sectors such as automobiles , semiconductors , and machine tools we are still fully competitive . It is in areas such as finance and information that we need to concentrate our efforts to catch up . 
 The Tokyo Big Bang is a series of reforms to restructure our financial system and institutions to achieve such goals in the area of finance . During the current session of the Diet ( parliament ) , a bill will be enacted to deregulate cross - border and cross - currency financial transactions completely . That act would transform the international financial field in Tokyo . Following foreign - exchange deregulation , blueprints to deregulate or internationalise areas such as securities , banking , insurance , business accounting standards , and taxation should be announced by the end of 1997 . Most of the changes should be enacted , where legal action is necessary , in the normal session of the Diet between January and June 1998 . Ryutaro Hashimoto Hashimoto has said the Tokyo Big Bang will be completed by 2001 , but the process is likely to be quicker than that , with most of the necessary measures in place by the end of the century . 
 The lessons of Asian history 
 Some of the irrational pessimism currently pervading Japan seems to be the result of an identity crisis to which many Japanese have fallen victim since the end of the cold war and the achievement of Japan 's goal of catching up with the West . Until quite recently , Japan could easily identify itself with the free non - socialist world , despite historical and cultural differences , and could concentrate on economic activities . 
 However , with the end of what Samuel Huntington , a professor at Harvard , calls the civil wars among the western powers , a new perspective on the world scene that places greater emphasis on differences between civilisations has emerged - and many Japanese who have had a few qualms about Americanising their way of life in the search for economic prosperity have suddenly lost their confidence now that they have achieved what they thought was their goal . Some confusion has naturally been generated and a serious search for national identity has ensued . 
 In order to understand the nature of this search - and to grasp its implications for modern Japan - it is necessary to look at some recent trends in Japanese historiography . Serious soul searching has been going on for some time now , particularly among philosophers , anthropologists , economic historians , and among Asian regional specialists . Many have taken a long , hard look at Japanese history before the Meiji modernisation in the 19th century and Asian history before westernisation . 
 Influenced by the writings of Fernand Braudel and Immanuel Wallerstein ( historians who helped establish a tradition of global comparative history ) , large numbers of Japanese intellectuals are beginning to realise that a global economic system existed in the areas around the Indian Ocean , the Arabic Sea , the South China Sea , and the East China Sea long before the westernisation of the world . The Mediterranean world sketched by Braudel and the world system across the Atlantic Ocean described by Wallerstein were nothing other than subsystems of the global system that encompassed Africa , the Mediterranean , the Islamic Middle East , India , China , and Southeast Asia . 
 The centre of world economic and commercial activity from about the eighth and ninth centuries until around the dawn of the i8th century was the area encompassed by the Islamic empires , India , Southeast Asia and the coastal areas of China . In the 15th and i6th centuries , Europe entered this global commercial network . Europeans imported enormous amounts of consumer goods , ranging from cotton products , tea , and ceramics , to lacquerware and seasonings such as pepper and cloves . They exchanged those goods for silver and gold which they obtained from North and South America . 
 The key to this global economic system was the importance placed on commercial activities by Islamic merchants . Around the time of the Abbasid dynasty , cross - border trade became extremely active in the Islamic world with merchants acting as mediators for the movement of goods among western and African countries , India , and ( later ) China . Joint business operations resembling modern corporations thrived . Islamic , Jewish , and other merchants travelling on dhows - wooden ships with triangular sails - had reached as far as the southern coast of China as early as the 11th or 12th century . Chinese merchants sailing on junks reached Calcutta and other Indian ports on the Bay of Bengal sometime between the 12th and 14th centuries . 
 It is true that Venetian , Spanish , Portuguese , Dutch , and English merchants participated in this global trading network . But compared with their Islamic , Indian , and Chinese counterparts they were latecomers , originally interested in importing luxury Asian goods for the European nobility and bourgeoisie in exchange for wool and woollen products or silver and gold . 
 Admittedly , the Industrial Revolution , which began in Europe in the late 18th century , and European superiority in firearms , have shifted the balance towards the West over the last zoo - odd years . However , according to the new view emerging among Japanese intellectuals , Asia has a long tradition of global trade among countries with diverse cultures and religions . What we are witnessing now is the "" Asian Renaissance "" , born of the fusion of Asian commercial globalism and western capitalism . 
 Owing to geography , Japan found itself at the periphery of the Asian global trading network , and precisely because of this peripheral location it has been able to retain its independence throughout its history . In this sense , Japanese history resembles that of western Europe , particularly England , in that the nation was never trampled under by the military aggression of the Chinese , Mongolian , or Islamic empires . Japan was late in developing its economic system compared with other Asian and Islamic countries . 
 Unlike economic historians of the past , Japanese Braudelians and Wallersteinians claim that Japan 's modernisation had proceeded fairly steadily before the Meiji Restoration of 1868 . They claim that levels of productivity , education , and culture during the 17th and i8th centuries in Japan were comparable to those in Europe . In explaining the rapid increase in agricultural productivity during the Edo period ( 1605i868 ) , they introduced the concept of an "" Industrious Revolution "" ( increase in labour productivity by independent and relatively entrepreneurial farmers ) ; this was conceived as a counterpart to the Industrial Revolution of the West . 
 Of course , some catching up was necessary in order to revolutionise production "" industrially "" and to equip a modern army . But the infrastructure of modernity , according to the new view in vogue among Japanese intellectuals , was already there . 
 Japan as model 
 The implication of all this historical work is as follows : the pivotal question facing Asia and Japan today is not an all - or - nothing choice between globalisation western - style or receding into a pre - modern and backward tradition . Rather , the question is how Asian countries can help create a new global system along with the West . 
 Many aspects of western market capitalism need to be incorporated into the new system , and in this context reform - perhaps even revolutionneeds to be implemented quickly . However , this does not imply that the traditional elements of the Asian economic structure - family and regional ties , or what Francis Fukuyama , of George Mason University , called the "" trust "" network - need to be changed . Rather , the "" Asian Renaissance "" may well create a new paradigm , one that is different from western individualism or laissez - faire capitalism . In such a paradigm , it is likely that there will be an important role for Japan , because it is both part of Asia and a nation that has succeeded in modernising its system without fundamentally losing its culture and religion . In other words , the sun may well rise again in the 21st century , with Japan not emulating the West but instead playing a leadership role in the effort to fuse modern western capitalism with pre - modern but nonetheless well - developed Asian global commercialism .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,Hashimoto,6,True

Starting on April 29th, the countries that have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention have ten years in which to get rid of their stocks of chemicals used in warfare, to dismantle the plants for making them, and to remove any chemical weapons left behind in other countries. Japan's sole obligation is to deal with the shells left in China in 1945. That is more than enough to keep the Japanese busy. 
China has not yet ratified the convention it signed with 129 other countries in Paris in 1993, but since 1991 it has been negotiating with Japan on the best way to clear up the old chemical dumps. Most of the dumps are in Jilin province, in northeast China. This is part of Manchuria, which Japan invaded in 1931, creating a puppet state. Surveys by China in the 1950s put the number of chemical shells left by Japan at 2m, mostly in the Harbin district. Smaller caches of chemical weapons have been found elsewhere in China. 
They are a continual danger. Claims for damages are working their way through the Tokyo courts on behalf of Chinese injured or killed by accidentally coming into contact with the chemicals. Officials in Beijing say that more than 2,000 people have been hurt or killed in this way. 
Japan has sent seven teams to various parts of China to examine the chemical dumps. The Japanese government puts the number of its chemical shells in China at 700,000, rather than the 2m estimated by the Chinese. The Japanese researchers say they have found no evidence that they contaminated the land or affected the health of local people. 
The Chinese have reluctantly agreed to let the Japanese deal with the crumbling shells in China rather than cart them back to Japan. But it will cost the Japanese government dearly.

But in December it agreed instead to build a special processing plant in Jilin province. The site and the technology to be used are expected to be decided soon. The cost of the plant is put at up to 500 billion ($4. billion). 
Neither China nor Japan has any experience of disposing of old chemical weapons. Japanese technicians have been sent to Germany, Britain and America to study various ways of handling the shells.

THIS week the yen fell to almost ei 127 to the dollar, its lowest level in more than four years. Japan's big exporters are cock-ahoop. Many of its car makers, electronics firms and electrical producers have probably made record profits in the financial year that ended in March. According to Toyo Keizai, a financial-information group, 93 of Japan's top 500 companiesnearly all manufacturers-will have made more money than ever before. 
Now they no longer face a strong yen, will Japanese manufacturers grumble less about the rules that make it costly to do business in Japan? According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), electricity prices are about a third above those in America, road transport costs about 4o% higher, and coastal shipping and international telephone charges three times as expensive. If big manufacturers stop pressing Ryutaro Hashimoto's government to deregulate, many expect reform to slow down. Hence the scepticism that greeted a package of 2,823 reforms announced in March. 
In fact, the government realises that manufacturing, which accounts for only 26% of GDP, is not big enough to revive the economy. It is therefore promoting change in telecoms, energy, transport, land and retailing. What does that mean for the industries involved? 
In energy the government abolished in April last year a rule that allowed Japan's small and inefficient oil refiners to monopolise imports of oil products. That meant refining costs were three times those in Singapore, and petrol prices the OECD'S highest. Deregulation has caused petrol prices to fall sharply. Transport companies are purring; the oil companies squealing. Showa Shell and Mitsubishi Oil, Japan's fifth and sixth biggest refiners, announced in February that they are to merge. More will follow them. 
In electricity, MITI has ordered generators to reduce prices by a fifth by 2001 and opened the market to new entrants. From next year companies such as Kobe Steel and Hitachi Zosen, a shipbuilder, will start to sell surplus electricity to the generators, and MITI is considering allowing them to sell their electricity directly by separating generation and distribution. On April 9th Toyota, Japan's largest car marker, announced that it plans to go into electricity generation. Japan's electricity generators, such as Tokyo Electric Power, will find their margins squeezed; retail and wholesale users will gain. 
In transport, the famously antediluvian Ministry of Transport announced in late January that it would abolish its rigid capacity and price controls by2001at the latest. It has already allowed more taxis and more flexible fare structures. Late last year, the ministry approved four new airlines, the biggest run by HIS, a discount-travel firm. These are the first new domestic carriers in 40 years and in March they received six slots at Tokyo's Haneda airport. The newcomers will hurt the three incumbent domestic airlines, and especially All Nippon Airways, which has the largest share of the domestic market. 
In telecoms, deregulation will initially strengthen the biggest firm. Restrictions which have long separated domestic and international calls have gone. That will allow NTT, Japan's domestic monopoly, to offer international calls (although it will be split into three parts, all held by a holding company). Competitors are terrified by the prospect of Nr, with bags of cash, a great brand name and a virtual monopoly on local calls, offering customers a one-stop shop. In an attempt to become big enough to compete,Japan Telecom, a long-distance carrier, will acquire ITJ, a small international carrier, in October. Again, more mergers are on the way. 
Price-cutting competition in telecoms will come more from new providers such as call-back services, which allow callers in Japan to take advantage of cheaper rates elsewhere. And, since the beginning of April, foreign companies have been able to connect their private leased lines to the Japanese domestic network. Users are delighted, particularly companies too small to have their own private lines. 
The construction ministry wants to bring down the price of house construction by 30%. So it is ditching prescriptive standards which say, for example, how thick a door must be rather than merely how long it should be able to withstand a fire. From the beginning of April, condominiums being built in big cities have been allowed to double the amount of floor space they can build on a given piece of land. 
In retailing, a law that made it almost impossible for big shops to set up without the permission of their would-be competitors has been progressively relaxed. That has brought a rapid expansion of big supermarkets and foreign retailers. MITI promises to go further this year by, for example, scrapping restrictions on opening times. Convenience stores will benefit from deregulation in product handling. For example, 7-Eleven and Lawson cannot sell vitamins (which account for 45% of sales of drugs over the counter) unless there is a doctor in the shop. That is about to change. 
Japan's politicians and bureaucrats are clearly less anxious than they were to protect inefficient domestic industries. That is reflected in share prices: over the past year, the worst performing sectors, from the bottom up, have been securities firms, shipping, construction, paper, steel, mining, warehousing, airlines, oil companies and banks. All have mainly domestic markets; all are ripe for deregulation; all have underperformed the Nikkei 500 index by between a third and a quarter. 
But the new political willingness to deregulate goes only so far. Peter Tasker, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment bank, points out that it will be no easier for foreigners to buy Japanese firms. Even in mobile telephony, one of Japan's most deregulated sectors, no licences have been won by foreign firms. Only when the japanese government is really serious about deregulation will it allow foreign investors easy access to the protected corners of its domestic markets.

If big manufacturers stop pressing Ryutaro Hashimoto's to deregulate , many expect reform to slow down . Hence the scepticism that greeted a package of 2,823 reforms announced in March . 
 In fact , Ryutaro Hashimoto realises that manufacturing , which accounts for only 26 % of GDP , is not big enough to revive the economy . Ryutaro Hashimoto is therefore promoting change in telecoms , energy , transport , land and retailing . What does that mean for the industries involved ? 
 In energy Ryutaro Hashimoto abolished in April last year a rule that allowed Japan 's small and inefficient oil refiners to monopolise imports of oil products . That meant refining costs were three times those in Singapore , and petrol prices the OECD 'S highest . Deregulation has caused petrol prices to fall sharply . Transport companies are purring ; the oil companies squealing . Showa Shell and Mitsubishi Oil , Japan 's fifth and sixth biggest refiners , announced in February that they are to merge . More will follow them . 
 In electricity , MITI has ordered generators to reduce prices by a fifth by 2001 and opened the market to new entrants . From next year companies such as Kobe Steel and Hitachi Zosen , a shipbuilder , will start to sell surplus electricity to the generators , and MITI is considering allowing them to sell their electricity directly by separating generation and distribution . On April 9th Toyota , Japan 's largest car marker , announced that it plans to go into electricity generation . Japan 's electricity generators , such as Tokyo Electric Power , will find their margins squeezed ; retail and wholesale users will gain . 
 In transport , the famously antediluvian Ministry of Transport announced in late January that it would abolish its rigid capacity and price controls by2001at the latest . It has already allowed more taxis and more flexible fare structures . Late last year , the ministry approved four new airlines , the biggest run by HIS , a discount - travel firm . These are the first new domestic carriers in 40 years and in March they received six slots at Tokyo 's Haneda airport . The newcomers will hurt the three incumbent domestic airlines , and especially All Nippon Airways , which has the largest share of the domestic market . 
 In telecoms , deregulation will initially strengthen the biggest firm . Restrictions which have long separated domestic and international calls have gone . That will allow NTT , Japan 's domestic monopoly , to offer international calls ( although it will be split into three parts , all held by a holding company ) . Competitors are terrified by the prospect of Nr , with bags of cash , a great brand name and a virtual monopoly on local calls , offering customers a one - stop shop . In an attempt to become big enough to compete , Japan Telecom , a long - distance carrier , will acquire ITJ , a small international carrier , in October . Again , more mergers are on the way . 
 Price - cutting competition in telecoms will come more from new providers such as call - back services , which allow callers in Japan to take advantage of cheaper rates elsewhere . And , since the beginning of April , foreign companies have been able to connect their private leased lines to the Japanese domestic network . Users are delighted , particularly companies too small to have their own private lines . 
 The construction ministry wants to bring down the price of house construction by 30 % . So it is ditching prescriptive standards which say , for example , how thick a door must be rather than merely how long it should be able to withstand a fire . From the beginning of April , condominiums being built in big cities have been allowed to double the amount of floor space they can build on a given piece of land . 
 In retailing , a law that made it almost impossible for big shops to set up without the permission of their would - be competitors has been progressively relaxed . That has brought a rapid expansion of big supermarkets and foreign retailers . MITI promises to go further this year by , for example , scrapping restrictions on opening times . Convenience stores will benefit from deregulation in product handling . For example , 7 - Eleven and Lawson can not sell vitamins ( which account for 45 % of sales of drugs over the counter ) unless there is a doctor in the shop . That is about to change . 
 Japan 's politicians and bureaucrats are clearly less anxious than they were to protect inefficient domestic industries . That is reflected in share prices : over the past year , the worst performing sectors , from the bottom up , have been securities firms , shipping , construction , paper , steel , mining , warehousing , airlines , oil companies and banks . All have mainly domestic markets ; all are ripe for deregulation ; all have underperformed the Nikkei 500 index by between a third and a quarter . 
 But the new political willingness to deregulate goes only so far . Peter Tasker , an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson , an investment bank , points out that it will be no easier for foreigners to buy Japanese firms . Even in mobile telephony , one of Japan 's most deregulated sectors , no licences have been won by foreign firms . Only when Ryutaro Hashimoto is really serious about deregulation will Ryutaro Hashimoto allow foreign investors easy access to the protected corners of its domestic markets .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,Ryutaro Hashimoto 's government,6,True

""I am disgusted"", thundered Ryutaro Hashimoto, when told on April 15th that yet another radiation leak had occurred in a plant run by the govemment's Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) What especially angered him was that, once again, the announcement had been delayed in an attempt to cover up mistakes made by the agency. Some 30 hours passed before the PNC told local authorities that radioactive tritium had leaked from its Fugen reactor in Fukui prefecture. ""It's completely hopeless,"" Mr Hashimoto declared as he ordered the Fugen advanced thermal-reactor to be shut down. Two days later the PNC compounded its sins, by belatedly admitting that there had been ii previous minor leaks at Fugen over the past three years. 
The most recent Fugen leak is the PNC'S third major accident in less than 18 months. More by luck than swift action or good judgment, none has been worse than level three on the international scale (with Chernobyl scoring seven, the maximum, and Three Mile Island five) A failure to extinguish a fire properly at the PNC's nuclear fuel plant at Tokaimura in Ibaraki prefecture on March lth set off an explosion that exposed 37 workers to radiation-making it Japan's worst nuclear accident. 
The Tokaimura plant is expected to remain closed until 2001, and the accident may have to be upgraded to level four if more people in the area are found to have been affected. Air samples taken from the plants ventilator shafts indicate an eightfold increase in particles capable of emitting alpha and gamma radiation. The PNC has found traces of radioactive caesium-137 up to 60km (38 miles) from the site. The fear is that other long-lasting isotopes, including plutonium-239, may have been released during the explosion as well. Apart from being radioactive, plutonium is 30,000 times more poisonous than cyanide. A single particle, if ingested, can lead to lung cancer. 
Ordinary Japanese, as well as the prime minister, are alarmed that the PNC has suppressed evidence and delayed warnings when accidents have occurred. The agency has been accused of a cover-up after a bungled attempt to put out the fire at Tokaimura. Had it been extinguished, there would have been no explosion, and far fewer people would have been exposed to radiation. Five officials at the plant have been fired, and criminal charges are being prepared. 
In December 1995, the Monju fast-breeder reactor at Tsuruga sprang a leak in its sodium-cooling circuitry. Though no radiation was released and no one died, three tons of liquid sodium burst from Monju's cooling circuits. This came close to exploding and blowing the plutonium-fuelled reactor to smithereens. So close did Monju come to being a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl that a PNC safety officer committed suicide. 
The safety officer revealed that the PNC had waited a whole hour before reporting the catastrophic leak to the authorities, and that a videotape of the damage caused by the spill had been heavily edited before being released to the press. Worse, despite fire alarms going off all over the place, operators had shut down the reactor slowly by hand instead of hitting the panic-button to close the reactor immediately. The Monju fast-breeder has remained shut - and may well be scrapped. 
The expanding nuclear industry in Japan is keen to prevent citizens' groups from gaining influence, as they have done in America. A growing number of towns now require referendums to be held before a nuclear power station can be built nearby. Despite promises of government riches, the residents of Maki, a small seaside town, voted last summer against having a nuclear power station on their doorstep. Japan gets a third of its electricity from nuclear power. Some 50 reactors have been built over the past 30 years. Another half a dozen or so are being built or planned. 
Mr Hashimoto has no argument with nuclear power. But the PNC's incompetence, which has put the public's health at risk, has stirred the wrath of the prime minister's office. Mr Hashimoto is determined to be remembered as the leader who brought Japan's overbearing civil service to heel. Bureaucrat-bashing is in season.

CRASH went the explosives. Out of tunnels beneath the Japanese ambassador's residence, in through its blown-in main entrance and by ladders on to the roof sprang 140 specially trained Peruvian government troops. Within 4o minutes, all 72 hostages were free, mostly unharmed. Every one of the 14 Tupac Amaru guerrillas who had been holding them was dead. President Alberto Fujimori had taken a calculated gamble and won hands down. 
Behind his smiling inscrutability, Mr Fujimori has always been both tough and ready for a calculated gamble. In 1992, he sent tanks to shut down Peru's Congress, which was hesitating to grant him the wide powers he sought to put down rampant guerrilla violence. On that occasion his bet was that domestic support would outweigh mild international disapproval. 
This week, after more than four months of on-off-on haggling for a peaceful end to the affair, he lost patience with the hostagetakers-and with the ever-timid Japanese government. Throughout the four months he had kept the Japanese constantly informed, but they were not told of the coming assault until it was under way. 
The hostage-takers-only 14 of them, fewer than had been thought at first, and many of them teenagers-were caught offguard. Several, including their leader, Nestor Cerpa, were reportedly playing indoor football in a room at ground level-until the floor exploded beneath them. They were swiftly killed, as soon were all the others. Some attempted to surrender, in vain. The troops had been ordered to take no prisoners; not, it seems, to make an example, or for the sake of later convenience, but for the speed and safety of the operation, in which it had been widely feared that many of the hostages would die. Only one did so, a Supreme Court judge, hit by a bullet (and, said some reports, a subsequent heart attack). Two soldiers were killed. 
Of the surviving hostages, only twoone was Francisco Tudela, Peru's foreign minister-were even wounded. All 24 Japanese escaped unhurt. That was as well for Mr Fujimori. In February,when it looked as if the Peruvians were preparing to use force, Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, hastily arranged to meet him in Toronto, and got what he thought was a promise to seek a peaceful solution-unless the guerrillas threatened to start killing their hostages-no matter how long it took. 
The affair has embarrassed the Japanese government from start to finish. The flamboyance of the embassy party which the Tupac Amaru guerrillas broke into was maybe unwise; the lax security certainly was. Worse, though it put all its embassies on high alert this week, Japan's manifest unreadiness for risky but decisive action against terrorists has been signalled to the world, not least by the Peruvians' failure to give it notice of the assault: Mr Hashimoto was woken from his sleep to be told it had happened. He wished he had been told in advance, he admitted publicly later, while conceding uncomfortably that ""President Fujimori used the best timing and that brought about the result."" 
Support for Mr Fujimori at home has soared. Peruvians were growing critical of the government's inability to end the affair. The assault followed weeks of seeming hesitation. In return for the hostages, Mr Fujimori had been prepared to fly their captors to Cuba, and won Cuban acceptance. But Nestor Cerpa overplayed his hand, stubbornly insisting not indeed-as in December-that all, but that at least some of the 4oo-odd people from his group held in Peru's jails be freed. Neither public opinion, nor Mr Fujimori's generals would contemplate that. Attempts at mediation by the Canadian ambassador and Juan Luis Cipriani, a Catholic bishop, had broken down on this point. Hours before the troops went in, Monsignor Cipriani announced that he was giving up. 
Now the president has restored his reputation as one ready for decisive action to maintain order. And in case anyone had missed the point, he greeted the freed hostages in person, dressed in a bullet-proof jacket. But he is not the only winner. Hard men in the armed forces had argued for the use of force right from the start; at the weekend two had replaced the then interior minister and police chief. Mr Cerpa's folly has done Peru's less-than-robust democratic institutions no good at all. ","LIMA AND TOKYO

A spate of bureaucratic mishaps has further eroded public trust. Worse, it seems that, like politicians, bureaucrats can be venal. 
The country's so-called ""iron triangle"" of interlocking interests-business, the bureaucracy and politics-has never really been anything more than an iron dumbbell: companies on one side, government regulators at the other.

Glad, for once, to see others accused of being on the take, Japan's politicians have been quick to blame civil servants for many of their own sins. During last October's general election, all the major political parties pounced on the bureaucracy's misfortunes, making ""administrative reform"" their rallying cry.

Reelected, Mr Hashimoto is now trying to deliver on his promise. In the next few weeks, his Administrative Reform Council will reveal its plans for cutting the bureaucracy down to size. 
But while a bureaucracy on the run has handed the politicians a chance to have more than a passing say in formulating policy, it is unclear what they will do with it. Do they, for example, have the intellectual resources to come up with solutions to Japan's national debt-now Y45o trillion ($3.6 trillion) and widening-or the rapidly ageing population that threatens to bankrupt the health and welfare services? 
At the moment they do not. The source of legislation in Japan has long been the bureaucracy. A cabinet minister's job is simply to shepherd a bill from his bureaucrats through parliament. The cabinet's task is to co-ordinate the legislative agenda and to seek a consensus with other political parties.That is how the legislative process has worked since the LDP came together in 1955. But is there a better way of creating policy in Japan? The Administrative Reform Council will recommend setting up British-style independent agencies to do a number of administrative jobs (such as vehicle licensing and managing teachers' pensions) currently performed by bureaucrats. But, though the ministries may be smaller, the remaining bureaucrats will still expect to formulate policy. 
If politicians are to gain control over policy, the quality of cabinet ministers will have to be improved. They need to be selected for their competence rather than their seniority, and then kept in their jobs long enough for them to master the intricacies of their ministries. They should answer their own questions in parliament rather than rely on officials from the ministries. The prime minister needs to be given power to take charge of a ministry if there is an emergency. The inability to do that is what lies behind the government's sorry record on crisis management during the Kobe earthquake two years ago, the costly oil spill in the Sea of Japan this year and the hostage crisis in Peru. 
Such measures would improve government and increase the ruling party's influence. The opposition parties need to be given more power, too. They should be allowed to call witnesses to give evidence in parliament, a right at present denied to the opposition. There might be public hearings (as in the American Congress) or select committees (as in the British parliament) to monitor the administration. 
Another idea to give more authority to government would be to introduce an American-style General Accounting Office (GAO)-as the fledgling Democratic Party, founded last September by Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan, wants to do. A Japanese GAo would help members of parliament ""to be better informed and debate issues such as government waste,"" says Yoshito Sengoku, head of the party's Policy Research Council. Mr Sengoku has made a study of waste in public corporations. 
Because such reforms would help government and opposition alike, their chances of being introduced are slim.

An unsettled dispute over the Senkaku islands (called Diaoyu in China), which both China and Taiwan also lay claim to, has given the Japanese an early glimpse of the kind of territorial skirmishes that might crop up. And with every new revelation from the starving and increasingly paranoid regime in Pyongyang, the Japanese have become more aware that North Korea has pointed its missiles as much at them as at the South Koreans. The cold war may be over, but the security climate around the region is still chilly. In Japanese political circles, the basis of cold-war strategy-to defend the homeland in the event of attack by Soviet forces-is now recognised as largely irrelevant. But finding the political will to confront a more diffuse, but no less alarming, set of threats is becoming one of the government's biggest worries. The publication of new defence guidelines on June 7th represents an overdue attempt to start redefining Japan's role. The way Japan has chosen to interpret its post-1945 constitution bars it from engaging in the collective use of force to settle international disputes. The Japanese like it that way. Japan's armed forces stay strictly at home-keeping defence costs down and soldiers out of harm's way. The constitution has also helped to reassure neighbours who suffered at the hands of the old imperial army that Japanese militarism is dead and buried. 
Unfortunately, such a stay-at-home approach to national security cannot help Japan defend itself from newer threats to its well-being. A suicidal thrust by a collapsing North Korean dictatorship, for instance, would require Japanese forces to venture farther afield. No matter how crude, missiles bearing nuclear or biological warheads would have to be hunted down and destroyed in their launching sites. This is what Bill Clinton was hinting at in April 1996, when he broached the idea of expanding the security pact between Japan and America. The two countries promised then to review their agreement on defence co-operation and give Japan a greater role. The result of the past 15 months' deliberations has now been made public. 
The joint security treaty that Japan signed with the United States in 196o remains the cornerstone of the country's defence policy. Guidelines put in place in 1978 spell out precisely how the two sides should co-operate to defend Japan from attack It is these guidelines that are now being updated. The draft recommendations cover some 4o-odd things that Japan would be expected to do during an emergency-from offering logistical support to American troops, to evacuating civilians. The report calls for Japan to support American forces in two main ways: by providing various facilities and by giving support at the rear. The first would allow American forces to use civilian airports and harbours in Japan and to rely on Japanese minesweeping and search-and-rescue operations at sea. The second would involve providing American ships and aircraft with supplies, including fuel and oil from Japanese stocks. Weapons and ammunition have been left off the supply list, though Japanese units will be allowed to transport ammunition and weapons for American forces, provided the stocks come from American depots. 
The interim report goes further, much further, than simply giving Japan a bigger part to play in its own defence. It shifts the whole emphasis of the security treaty between the two countries away from defending the Japanese archipelago towards dealing with conflicts in the region surrounding Japan. Two of the three sets of circumstances considered by the report cover much the same ground as the existing guidelines: how to prepare for an invasion of Japan and how to repulse an invader. It is the third set of circumstances-how to work together during emergencies in surrounding areas-which represents the main thrust of the revised guidelines. 
America has been making it clear for several years that the biggest stick it has in coping with conflicts in and around the Pacific is its security treaty with Japan. As the Americans see it, the bigger the stick, the better. But the drafting has not been entirely a matter of America thrusting its demands on a reluctant Japan. The Japanese have their own agenda. They want, above all, a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Doing more to help to keep the peace in Asia could bolster Japan's case. 
The government believes that the report itself will not have to be debated in the Diet (parliament). But various laws will have to be amended if Japanese forces are to play a wider role. Ryutaro Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party aims to introduce a package of bills in the next session. The trickiest part for the government now will be putting the public's mind at rest about the ""grey areas"" in the report. Some parts have been deliberately left ambiguous. One such concerns minesweeping, a non-combat activity that Japan might be expected to undertake for American troops making a landing on, say, a Korean peninsula at war. But an enemy would hardly view Japanese mine-sweeping, even by non-combatants, as peaceful-and could well respond with direct attacks on Japanese forces. There are also legitimate concerns within the Diet that Japan could be dragged into conflicts-breaking up a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, for instancethat were of greater concern to the United States than to Japan itself. 
So far, the main political parties in Japan have been careful not to over-react to the new guidelines. But eventually the issue is expected to make the Social Democratic Party abandon its shaky alliance with the Liberal Democrats. Though the party is nowadays a shadow of its former self, its support-especially in the upper househas helped Mr Hashimoto's minority government remain in power. Without it, he would have to cut a deal elsewhere. 
Most expect him, reluctantly, to accept the overtures from conservatives within Ichiro Ozawa's New Frontier Party, the lar est of the opposition groups and the most enthusiastic about a bigger security role for Japan. China has already expressed its vehement opposition to Japan's beefed up security pact with America (see box). It is going to like it even less when the revised guidelines are enthusiastically embraced by a new hardline Japanese government. ","TOKYO Its new defence guidelines are a cautious step in the right direction WITH several of the world 's most dangerous places on its doorstep , Japan is coming painfully and reluctantly to terms with the insecurities of Asia after the cold war . An unsettled dispute over the Senkaku islands ( called Diaoyu in China ) , which both China and Taiwan also lay claim to , has given the Japanese an early glimpse of the kind of territorial skirmishes that might crop up . And with every new revelation from the starving and increasingly paranoid regime in Pyongyang , the Japanese have become more aware that North Korea has pointed its missiles as much at them as at the South Koreans . The cold war may be over , but the security climate around the region is still chilly . In Japanese political circles , the basis of cold - war strategy - to defend the homeland in the event of attack by Soviet forces - is now recognised as largely irrelevant . But finding the political will to confront a more diffuse , but no less alarming , set of threats is becoming one of Ryutaro Hashimoto's biggest worries . The publication of new defence guidelines on June 7th represents an overdue attempt to start redefining Japan 's role . The way Japan has chosen to interpret its post-1945 constitution bars it from engaging in the collective use of force to settle international disputes . The Japanese like it that way . Japan 's armed forces stay strictly at home - keeping defence costs down and soldiers out of harm 's way . The constitution has also helped to reassure neighbours who suffered at the hands of the old imperial army that Japanese militarism is dead and buried . 
 Unfortunately , such a stay - at - home approach to national security can not help Japan defend itself from newer threats to its well - being . A suicidal thrust by a collapsing North Korean dictatorship , for instance , would require Japanese forces to venture farther afield . No matter how crude , missiles bearing nuclear or biological warheads would have to be hunted down and destroyed in their launching sites . This is what Bill Clinton was hinting at in April 1996 , when he broached the idea of expanding the security pact between Japan and America . The two countries promised then to review their agreement on defence co - operation and give Japan a greater role . The result of the past 15 months ' deliberations has now been made public .

South Korea knows that, if war were to break out with North Korea, American troops and planes passing through American bases in japan would be critical to its survival. But South Korea is still hypersensitive about its former colonial master. It does not want the Japanese to join in any fighting, nor Japanese warships to patrol in South Korean waters.

By that they do not mean the alliance's old job of containing Russia, but what they fear is its new one: containing China. Ever since Bill Clinton and Ryutaro Hashimoto reaffirmed their security alliance last year, both Japan and America have been at pains to tell China that the alliance is not directed at anyone, only at coping with instability. But, perhaps because many countries in the region see an increasingly powerful China as a rising source of tension, the Chinese are not so easily fobbed off. 
Back in April, China's foreign-ministry spokesman said publicly for the first time that China opposed the stationing of foreign-read American-forces in the region.

1997-06-28,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224111186/fulltext/10C2E2F7BFAB4D5APQ/85?accountid=14657,"Proposed reforms of Japan's hugely wasteful financial system are long overdue. But they will hurt much more than advertised, says Richard Cookson 
JAPAN is about to set out on the economic equivalent of a radical slimming cure. It needs to do something drastic to downsize its bloated, rigid and inert financial system and make it fit, flexible and fleet of foot. Last November the country's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, announced that his country's financial system would soon have its own ""Big Bang"" to free it from heavy regulation and segmentation. The term was invented for Britain's reforms a decade earlier, when the London Stock Exchange was thrown open to all comers and commissions deregulated; but Japan's Big Bang is much more ambitious. In particular, it is intended to shrink the banking system and its ability to lend recklessly. This should increase competition, and thus returns for savers. 
In the recent past, Japan's financial system has proved better at destroying wealth than at creating it. Whereas other stockmarkets have soared, the Nikkei zzs average is still trading at half its peak, seven-and-a-half years after Japan's stockmarket bubble burst. At the same time land values have plummeted. These two factors together, says Jesper Koll, an economist at J.P. Morgan, have destroyed a decade's wealth-creation (see chart 1, next page). 
Then there is the rockiness of the banks. Ignore the finance ministry's assurances that they have nearly solved their bad-debt problems: many of Japan's banks are still chock-a-block with bad loans. By the end of the financial year this March, banks had written off, written down or reserved against some 254 trillion of bad loans, with about 15 trillion still to go, according to Betsy Daniels, an analyst at Morgan Stanley-and at a time when interest rates are at a record low. As and when interest rates go up, so will the banks' bad debts. 
None of the top zo banks has actually gone bust, and none, claims the government, will be allowed to. But in a financially more sophisticated country, at least two, Hokkaido Takushoku and Nippon Credit Bank, would have been shut down; and all 2o are probably still in worse shape than they own up to. This year they will be able to make reserves against ""self-assessments"", filed with the finance ministry, that do not have to tally with what they say in public. Banking rumour has it that at least one city bank's self-assessment of its bad loans is double the figure it officially admits to. 
Unloved yen 
Next, there are concerns about the yen's status as an international currency. The introduction due in 1999 of the euro, Europe's single currency, will further reduce the already modest number of international transactions denominated in yen. Although Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation, the yen has never been a truly international currency: the country's capital markets are so undeveloped that nobody really wants to hold yen. This matters because it leaves Japanese companies particularly exposed to foreign-exchange risks. The government, too, suffers from the yen's lack of international stature. Its gross debt-to-;DP ratio has been rising alarmingly, and is likely to reach too% this year. The extra liquidity would make it easier for the government to finance its deficit. 
There are worries, too, that Tokyo as a financial centre is lagging behind London and New York. Lots of Japanese financial products are traded elsewhere. For example, fully one-third of the business in Nikkei 225 stock futures is conducted on the Singapore Monetary Exchange (Simex); and 15% of the trading in Japanese shares is booked in London. Nor does Tokyo attract foreign business in the way that New York and London do. Many foreign companies have delisted their shares from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.A telling set of statistics from the Nomura Research Institute puts the value of foreign-equity trades in 1995 at $1.2 trillion in London, $261 billion in New York, and $1 billion in Tokyo. This survey will argue that the common factor behind all these failings, and the most compelling reason for deregulation, is a fundamental flaw in Japan's financial system: its crass inefficiency at allocating money, any economy's lifeblood. Despite some recent tinkering, the system remains hugely biased against savers and in favour of borrowers and intermediaries such as banks and securities firms. 
Savers have little choice over where to invest their money; for reasons that will be explained later, most of them put it on deposit at the bank or, increasingly, the post office. Deposit-takers, on the other hand, until recently had little reason to worry about the relative riskiness of their borrowers. Rapid growth eventually lifted all boats off the rocks. Besides, lending was backed by collateral, and if that was not enough, a firm's main bank would bail it out. Ultimately the banks were guaranteed by the government. And the keiretsu system of cross-shareholdings among ""families"" of firms with common interests made it hard for outside shareholders to apply pressure on banks to lend more profitably. 
This system worked reasonably well while the economy was immature and money was scarce; but now that the economy has grown older and money more plentiful, the system has become counterproductive. It squanders savers' money on a breathtaking scale. Returns on household financial assets are puny, as chart 2 shows. Banks, with their huge captive deposit base, are lending to anyone with collateral who wants to borrow, good risk or bad. 
Because of the way the system has developed, money has, in one sense, no value. Rare is the Japanese company which pauses to think that the cost of money has anything to do with the risks the firm is exposed to. Companies with a credit rating little better than junk can borrow money at a rate only slightly higher than that paid by rock-solid firms. As a result, few Japanese companies bother to work out ""hurdle rates"" (the risk-adjusted minimum rate of return they need to earn on an investment). Some admit that if they did, they would probably never make any investments. 
None of this does savers and private investors any good at all. Alex Kinmont, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, has had a stab at working out just how unprofitable Japanese companies are. He reckons that the big companies listed on the blue-chip section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange are earning only about half the 8% return that equity investors should expect on reasonable assumptions about risk premiums and bond yields. Of the ao biggest banks, only five would make that return. 
The Japanese financial system's most urgent need is for greater flexibility. As things stand, certain products and services can be offered only by specific institutions. Banks cannot underwrite or deal in shares, but only they can offer foreign-exchange services; securities firms cannot offer banking services, but only they can directly sell investment trusts, the Japanese version of mutual funds. Neither is allowed to sell or underwrite insurance. Commissions on all but the largest equity trades are still fixed. 
Nurse knows best 
The main obstacle in the way of more flexibility has been the Japanese finance ministry. The trouble with the ministry is that it thinks it knows best; certainly better than markets, which it deems dangerous. New products, for example, must be approved by the ministry to protect investors from their own ignorance (the word ""confusion"" is often bandied around).Yet with a few notable exceptions, the ministry's employees, shunted from section to section, are themselves ignorant about modern finance. Though many have been to Tokyo University, Japan's best, most graduated in law. They take their time to think about new-fangled ideas, so the wait to launch a new financial product can be interminable. Only this July will the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange at long last be allowed to list options on individual stocks. 
The ministry's strong control on new products also makes for some odd inconsistencies. Over-thecounter (OTC) equity derivatives such as swaps and options are still considered gambling instruments, so they remain banned in Japan, even though they are permitted in every other big developed country. But oTc bond options do not, apparently, fall foul of Japan's gambling laws, and are therefore allowed. Moreover, the ministry's rules governing financial firms are notoriously opaque, and subject to bureaucratic whim; often they seem calculated not so much to regulate firms but to protect them. 
Japan's Big Bang is supposed to change all this. In response to the ministry's mishandling of the banking crisis, a decision has already been made to move supervision of banks and securities firms to a new independent body, which will probably start work in July 1998. To ensure that its operations become truly transparent, it needs to escape the clutches of the ministry from which most of its employees will be drawn. But the mandarins will be reluctant to yield power. 
When Mr Hashimoto announced that he wanted to create a modern financial system, sceptics homed in on the future role of the finance ministry. Even if he were serious about reform, many argued, surely vested interests would blunt his good intentions? Some doubts remain about the government's willingness to push through financial reform. There is still no mastermind, no single body responsible for overseeing the process. 
There has, however, been ""an emotional spasm"", in the words of Peter Tasker, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. By now, everybodyand that includes the bureaucrats at the finance ministry-is well aware that change is unavoidable. Committees in the ministry are devising plans to tear down the walls within Japan's financial system. ""The surprising thing is not that the Japanese financial system is changing now,"" says Kazuhito Ikeo, a professor at Keio University, ""it is that it has not changed before."" 
Some of the walls are already tumbling. This spring, for instance, a law was passed that will all but repeal the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Act. From next April, domestic investors should find it much easier to invest overseas. Further proposals were announced in mid-June. Also from next April, stock commissions on trades of more than 5om will be liberalised, restrictions on all oTc derivatives will go and securities firms will be able to offer bank-like accounts. The following year most of the remaining walls between banks and securities firms will be removed, though they will have to work through subsidiaries. 
Some Japanese bureaucrats think that reforming the financial sector will have little effect on the real economy, and that many of its features, such as high investment and stable employment, will remain the same. This is unlikely. The changes in the financial system will have profound consequences for the way Japanese companies are run. Much of what is special about Japanese capitalism simply reflects the inadequate rewards that capital has attracted. Now companies will have to start counting the true cost of money. Deprived of cheap funds from the banks, many of the weaker ones will be forced out of business. Indeed, the pace of such change will be the best indication of whether corporate Japan is getting into shape. ","Proposed reforms of Japan 's hugely wasteful financial system are long overdue . But they will hurt much more than advertised , says Richard Cookson 
 JAPAN is about to set out on the economic equivalent of a radical slimming cure . It needs to do something drastic to downsize its bloated , rigid and inert financial system and make it fit , flexible and fleet of foot . Last November Ryutaro Hashimoto's announced that Ryutaro Hashimoto's country 's financial system would soon have its own "" Big Bang "" to free it from heavy regulation and segmentation . The term was invented for Britain 's reforms a decade earlier , when the London Stock Exchange was thrown open to all comers and commissions deregulated ; but Japan 's Big Bang is much more ambitious . In particular , it is intended to shrink the banking system and its ability to lend recklessly . This should increase competition , and thus returns for savers . 
 In the recent past , Japan 's financial system has proved better at destroying wealth than at creating it . Whereas other stockmarkets have soared , the Nikkei zzs average is still trading at half its peak , seven - and - a - half years after Japan 's stockmarket bubble burst . At the same time land values have plummeted . These two factors together , says Jesper Koll , an economist at J.P. Morgan , have destroyed a decade 's wealth - creation ( see chart 1 , next page ) . 
 Then there is the rockiness of the banks . Ignore the finance ministry 's assurances that they have nearly solved their bad - debt problems : many of Japan 's banks are still chock - a - block with bad loans . By the end of the financial year this March , banks had written off , written down or reserved against some 254 trillion of bad loans , with about 15 trillion still to go , according to Betsy Daniels , an analyst at Morgan Stanley - and at a time when interest rates are at a record low . As and when interest rates go up , so will the banks ' bad debts . 
 None of the top zo banks has actually gone bust , and none , claims the government , will be allowed to . But in a financially more sophisticated country , at least two , Hokkaido Takushoku and Nippon Credit Bank , would have been shut down ; and all 2o are probably still in worse shape than they own up to . This year they will be able to make reserves against "" self - assessments "" , filed with the finance ministry , that do not have to tally with what they say in public . Banking rumour has it that at least one city bank 's self - assessment of its bad loans is double the figure it officially admits to . 
 Unloved yen 
 Next , there are concerns about the yen 's status as an international currency . The introduction due in 1999 of the euro , Europe 's single currency , will further reduce the already modest number of international transactions denominated in yen . Although Japan is the world 's biggest creditor nation , the yen has never been a truly international currency : the country 's capital markets are so undeveloped that nobody really wants to hold yen . This matters because it leaves Japanese companies particularly exposed to foreign - exchange risks . The government , too , suffers from the yen 's lack of international stature . Its gross debt - to-;DP ratio has been rising alarmingly , and is likely to reach too% this year . The extra liquidity would make it easier for the government to finance its deficit . 
 There are worries , too , that Tokyo as a financial centre is lagging behind London and New York . Lots of Japanese financial products are traded elsewhere . For example , fully one - third of the business in Nikkei 225 stock futures is conducted on the Singapore Monetary Exchange ( Simex ) ; and 15 % of the trading in Japanese shares is booked in London . Nor does Tokyo attract foreign business in the way that New York and London do . Many foreign companies have delisted their shares from the Tokyo Stock Exchange . A telling set of statistics from the Nomura Research Institute puts the value of foreign - equity trades in 1995 at $ 1.2 trillion in London , $ 261 billion in New York , and $ 1 billion in Tokyo . This survey will argue that the common factor behind all these failings , and the most compelling reason for deregulation , is a fundamental flaw in Japan 's financial system : its crass inefficiency at allocating money , any economy 's lifeblood . Despite some recent tinkering , the system remains hugely biased against savers and in favour of borrowers and intermediaries such as banks and securities firms . 
 Savers have little choice over where to invest their money ; for reasons that will be explained later , most of them put it on deposit at the bank or , increasingly , the post office . Deposit - takers , on the other hand , until recently had little reason to worry about the relative riskiness of their borrowers . Rapid growth eventually lifted all boats off the rocks . Besides , lending was backed by collateral , and if that was not enough , a firm 's main bank would bail it out . Ultimately the banks were guaranteed by the government . And the keiretsu system of cross - shareholdings among "" families "" of firms with common interests made it hard for outside shareholders to apply pressure on banks to lend more profitably . 
 This system worked reasonably well while the economy was immature and money was scarce ; but now that the economy has grown older and money more plentiful , the system has become counterproductive . It squanders savers ' money on a breathtaking scale . Returns on household financial assets are puny , as chart 2 shows . Banks , with their huge captive deposit base , are lending to anyone with collateral who wants to borrow , good risk or bad . 
 Because of the way the system has developed , money has , in one sense , no value . Rare is the Japanese company which pauses to think that the cost of money has anything to do with the risks the firm is exposed to . Companies with a credit rating little better than junk can borrow money at a rate only slightly higher than that paid by rock - solid firms . As a result , few Japanese companies bother to work out "" hurdle rates "" ( the risk - adjusted minimum rate of return they need to earn on an investment ) . Some admit that if they did , they would probably never make any investments . 
 None of this does savers and private investors any good at all . Alex Kinmont , an analyst at Morgan Stanley , has had a stab at working out just how unprofitable Japanese companies are . He reckons that the big companies listed on the blue - chip section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange are earning only about half the 8 % return that equity investors should expect on reasonable assumptions about risk premiums and bond yields . Of the ao biggest banks , only five would make that return . 
 The Japanese financial system 's most urgent need is for greater flexibility . As things stand , certain products and services can be offered only by specific institutions . Banks can not underwrite or deal in shares , but only they can offer foreign - exchange services ; securities firms can not offer banking services , but only they can directly sell investment trusts , the Japanese version of mutual funds . Neither is allowed to sell or underwrite insurance . Commissions on all but the largest equity trades are still fixed . 
 Nurse knows best 
 The main obstacle in the way of more flexibility has been the Japanese finance ministry . The trouble with the ministry is that it thinks it knows best ; certainly better than markets , which it deems dangerous . New products , for example , must be approved by the ministry to protect investors from their own ignorance ( the word "" confusion "" is often bandied around).Yet with a few notable exceptions , the ministry 's employees , shunted from section to section , are themselves ignorant about modern finance . Though many have been to Tokyo University , Japan 's best , most graduated in law . They take their time to think about new - fangled ideas , so the wait to launch a new financial product can be interminable . Only this July will the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange at long last be allowed to list options on individual stocks . 
 The ministry 's strong control on new products also makes for some odd inconsistencies . Over - thecounter ( OTC ) equity derivatives such as swaps and options are still considered gambling instruments , so they remain banned in Japan , even though they are permitted in every other big developed country . But oTc bond options do not , apparently , fall foul of Japan 's gambling laws , and are therefore allowed . Moreover , the ministry 's rules governing financial firms are notoriously opaque , and subject to bureaucratic whim ; often they seem calculated not so much to regulate firms but to protect them . 
 Japan 's Big Bang is supposed to change all this . In response to the ministry 's mishandling of the banking crisis , a decision has already been made to move supervision of banks and securities firms to a new independent body , which will probably start work in July 1998 . To ensure that its operations become truly transparent , it needs to escape the clutches of the ministry from which most of its employees will be drawn . But the mandarins will be reluctant to yield power . 
 When Ryutaro Hashimoto announced that Ryutaro Hashimoto wanted to create a modern financial system , sceptics homed in on the future role of the finance ministry . Even if Ryutaro Hashimoto were serious about reform , many argued , surely vested interests would blunt Ryutaro Hashimoto's good intentions ? Some doubts remain about the government 's willingness to push through financial reform . There is still no mastermind , no single body responsible for overseeing the process . 
 There has , however , been "" an emotional spasm "" , in the words of Peter Tasker , an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson . By now , everybodyand that includes the bureaucrats at the finance ministry - is well aware that change is unavoidable . Committees in the ministry are devising plans to tear down the walls within Japan 's financial system . "" The surprising thing is not that the Japanese financial system is changing now , "" says Kazuhito Ikeo , a professor at Keio University , "" it is that it has not changed before . ""

The rest of his body was discovered the same afternoon. A note in the boy's mouth predicted more murders; in a letter to a local newspaper the murderer threatened to kill three people a week. On June 28th, police arrested a boy of 14 who, they say, confessed not just to killing Jun Hase, but also to attacking two schoolgirls in March, one of whom died. 
The murder and the age of the suspect have provoked a bout of soul-searching in Japan.

People tell the police what they know. In the Kobe murder, the police received over 3,000 pieces of information from the public.

Despite a record low turnout (40.8%), caused as much by the scorching heat as by the shortage of good scandals and controversies, the election for the city's assembly on July 6th prompts three political predictions. 
The first is that the resurgent Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will continue to build on the remarkable recovery it made at last October's general election. Already poised to gain an overall majority in the powerful lower house of the Diet (parliament), the LDP looks certain to strengthen its position still further in the upper-house election a year hence. By then, the ruling party could be back with the majority in both houses that it has enjoyed throughout most of its history. 
The second forecast is that political parties that have failed to differentiate themselves from the Liberal Democrats-either because they joined the LDP-led coalition or because they have split from the LDr but remained virtually indistinguishable-will become increasingly irrelevant. It is now only a matter of time, months probably, before the imploding Social Democratic Party vanishes and Ichiro Ozawa's fractious New Frontier Party (NFP) falls apart altogether. 
The third prophesy is that, lacking any discernible opposition, Japanese voters who wish to make a protest will in future either abstain or throw their weight behind the Communist Party. Watch for the Communists to start winning more mayoralties and governorships in the months aheadand to increase their strength in the upper house next year. 
The clear winners in the Tokyo municipal election were the LDP, which increased its presence in the 127-seat assembly from 38 to 54; the Communists, who doubled their number of seats from 13 to 26; and the Buddhist-affiliated Komei, which saw all 24 of its candidates elected. The Social Democrats, by contrast, saw their seats fall from four to one. None of the NFa'S ii candidates was elected. 
The Democratic Party of Japanformed less than a year ago-fizzled badly, too. Aiming for a minimum of 25 seats, the Democrats wound up with only 12. Pulled in opposite directions by its two joint leaders, the party's days are numbered. 
At present, however, it is Mr Ozawa who has the biggest problems. At the national level, the Komei threw its lot in with his followers when the NFP was formed in 1994. The two groups have functioned as a single party in the lower house of the Diet ever since. As the political wing of the Soka Gakkai, a lay Buddhist organisation with more than 8m supporters in Japan, the Komei has enormous wealth and a reputation for getting out the vote. It was all set to merge the rest of its political apparatus with the NFP's later this summer. But after getting ten times as many votes as the NFP in the Tokyo election, the Komei's leaders are now having second thoughts. 
Meanwhile, Mr Ozawa is facing further desertions from his party. This past week it was the turn of Kazuo Aichi, a former defence minister, to leave the NFP, fed up with Mr Ozawa's bullying tactics and highhanded manner. Three more NFP Diet members are expected to leave before the end of July, bringing the total number of NFP defections to 53-almost a third of the party's parliamentary membership. Most defectors have headed back to the LDP. 
Mr Ozawa would like to do the same, and take the rest of his former LDP colleagues with him. He has been having long discussions with the barons on the more conservative wing of the LDP.

That demonstration, combined with the determination of Masahide Ota, Okinawa's governor, to see all American bases closed by 2015, convinced many outsiders that the American bases on Okinawa faced overwhelming local opposition. Not so. As tempers have cooled in Japan's southernmost outpost, so more and more locals have become convinced that the bases are still important to the island's economic future. Local newspaper polls have recently found that only 14-23% of residents actually want to see them closed. 
Instead of focusing on the outright closure of the bases, many Okinawans seem to have adopted a more subtle strategy. This involves continuing to make life difficult for America's military bases on their doorstep, so as to extract a higher price for their continued presence. At the same time, officials in both Okinawa and Tokyo are working hard on new schemes that are designed to diversify the island's economy. 
The problem is that, while America's military presence on Okinawa nowadays contributes only 7% to the prefecture's economy (down from 41% at the time Japan took back Okinawa in 1972), it counts for vastly more in the towns and villages surrounding the bases-especially in the poorer northern half of the island. Some communities in rural Okinawa have even started hinting that they would not mind having bases that are being relocated from elsewhere moved to their neighbourhood. 
At 6%, unemployment on Okinawa is nearly twice the national average. After the prefectural government, America is one of Okinawa's biggest employers, providing good livelihoods for some 8,ooo local inhabitants. The bases are also a major source of income for 28,ooo landowners. While a small but vocal group of anti-war protesters, who have acquired tiny plots of one tsubo (3.3 square metres) or less, have been demanding that America vacate the land they own, that is the last thing that most local landlords want. Nearly half of them are retired, relying on the rent from the bases as their only source of income. If handed their land back, few could expect to receive anything like the average Y11m ($95,000) per hectare they get annually from leasing their plots to the bases. Nor could they get the annual 5% increase in income that is guaranteed by the arrangement. 
Landowners aside, the biggest fear for Okinawans generally is that, were the bases to go, so would the generous handouts that the government in Tokyo doles out as compensation for playing host to three out of four American bases in all of Japan. With little local manufacturing, a backward farming sector that still relies heavily on sugar cane and a tourist industry hobbled by sky-high air fares from the mainland and restricted flights elsewhere, the prefecture relies on subsidies from Tokyo for twothirds of its income-some Y430 billion a year. To that has to be added Y4.7 trillionworth of development aid that the central government has provided over the 25 years since reversion. 
How to wean Okinawa's 1.3m residents-the most heavily subsidised people in Japan-off handouts? Not easy given the island's singular disinterest in entrepreneurial activity. But the prefectural government has not given up hope. Its latest wheeze, ""Cosmopolitan City Okinawa"", aims to make the island self-sufficient, while taking advantage of its cultural heritage and natural beauty. 
Most of this is pie in the sky. But a few things make eminent sense. One plan involves lobbying the central government to deregulate airfares so that the local tourist industry can take off. (ust see what Hawaii has done since American air fares were deregulated.) Another proposal is to provide tax breaks for manufacturers who import components and then re-export the finished goods. Given such breaks, Taiwanese entrepreneurs say they would invest heavily in Okinawa, just so they could export ""Made in Japan"" products to the rest of the world. 
Back in Tokyo, Mr Hashimoto's party and its coalition partners have roughed out an eight-point plan for Okinawa. The key element is to turn the prefecture into a freetrade zone under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that would offer Okinawa a more flexible tax and regulatory regime than mainland Japan. So far, however, the prime minister and his colleagues have failed to sway the finance ministry, which frowns on such panderings to the provinces. As Okinawans see it, Mr Hashimoto had better start banging some bureaucratic heads together and bring something more than the Y5 billion offered so far. No one forgets that the first, and last, time the present emperor visited Okinawa, someone lobbed a Molotov cocktail at him-an act unimaginable elsewhere in Japan.

So far , however , the prime minister and his colleagues have failed to sway the finance ministry , which frowns on such panderings to the provinces . As Okinawans see it , Mr Hashimoto had better start banging some bureaucratic heads together and bring something more than the Y5 billion offered so far . No one forgets that the first , and last , time the present emperor visited Okinawa , someone lobbed a Molotov cocktail at him - an act unimaginable elsewhere in Japan . Given their mounting frustrations , the normally easy - going natives of Okinawa could turn a good deal nastier than anyone thinks .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,Mr Hashimoto 's party,2,True

The u-turn made by the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, in a policy speech given to businessmen in Tokyo recently, has at last raised the prospect of a substantial improvement in relations. 
Like a cracked record, Japan has in recent years infuriated its friends by mindlessly repeating that there can be no question of economic aid for Russia until progress is made on the return of the Northern Territories-the four islands off the northern tip of Japan lost to the Soviet Union at the end of the second world war. Though this ""indivisibility"" between economic and political relations is presented as the cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy towards Russia, many inside as well as outside Japan have begun to view it more as a stumbling-block. 
The Soviet Union almost agreed to return at least two of the four disputed islands in 1973, with hints that the other two islands could follow. But after bellicose demands from Kakuei Tanaka, Japan's prime minister at the time, for the return of all four islands-otherwise known as the southern Kuriles-an angry Leonid Brezhnev put the offer back into cold storage. All subsequent attempts to conclude a peace treaty, putting an official end to hostilities between the two countries, have been thwarted by the territorial dispute. 
Boris Yeltsin broke some of the ice during his visit to Japan in 1993. He recognised the validity of a 1956 joint declaration that promised to return two of the islands to Japan. The Tokyo Declaration that emerged after the 1993 summit agreed to seek a solution to the territorial dispute ""on the basis of historical and legal facts"", though the Russians then backed off sharply on a promise of talks because of nationalist pressure at home. Mr Hashimoto has now decided to put the fruitless territorial bickering aside for the moment, and instead stress the need for Japan to strengthen its economic relations with Russia first. 
Over the past two years, the two countries have shown that they can get along if they try. Russian gunboats had been firing shots across the bows of Japanese trawlers which ventured too close to the disputed islands. But Japanese officials and their Russian counterparts put their heads together, without recriminations, and defined safe fishing zones and ways of arbitrating disputes that did not compromise either side's claim to the islands. Mr Hashimoto wants to build on the ""positive attitude"" fostered by the fishing accord. 
Within days of Mr Hashimoto's initiative came concrete proof that a lot of preparation had been done beforehand. Approval was announced for a joint $10 billion project to develop a natural-gas field in Irkutsk in Russia and build a pipe line to Japan via Mongolia, China and South Korea. The foreign ministry in Tokyo hinted that talks between the four countries involved may start as early as this month. Mr Hashimoto will then join President Yeltsin at an unofficial summit in the Russian Far East in early November to discuss this and other projects. 
Mr Hashimoto has promised to take a long-term view ofthe relationship. But how long-term? He probably wants to see serious signs of progress on the return of the islands by no later than the summer of 1999. That is when his second two-year term as prime minister will be drawing to a close. In recent times, no Japanese prime minister-other than Yasuhiro Nakasone, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1987-has hung on to the job for more than two terms. As he enters his second term this September, Mr Hashimoto may see co-operation with Russia as a way to secure a favourable write-up in the history books.

As such, he can look forward to being prime minister for another two years after his current term as party leader expires on September 30th. But that is the extent of certainty in Japanese politics at the moment. A debilitating power struggle has broken out over the future direction of the LDP. It is even spilling into the ranks of the opposition, threatening to create new groupings among the minor parties. 
In simple terms, it is a struggle between the young-or the relatively young, this being politicsand the old. The leading ""youngster"" is Koichi Kato, aged 58, the party's secretary-general. He is widely credited with engineering the LDP's remarkable comeback in last September's general election and its humbling of the opposition in the Tokyo municipal election in July. 
The government has managed to get its legislative programme through the Diet (parliament) thanks largely to Mr Kato's success in keeping two minor parties within the coalition, the small Social Democratic Party and the even smaller New Party Sakigake, and by wooing disaffected members from the opposition New Frontier Party. He has built the Liberal Democrats' strength in the all-important 500seat lower house of the Diet from 231 after September's election to 25o today. 
The most wobbly member of the coalition is the Social Democratic Party. It is unhappy about the coming review of the defence guidelines that seeks to give Japan an enlarged role under its security treaty with America. The Social Democrats want to see the security pact torn up rather than beefed up. With an upper-house election due in July next year, they fear losses worse than those they have already suffered if they remain in the government. Many of their leftwing supporters have given up and thrown their weight behind the resurgent Communist Party. Mr Kato will be hard pressed to keep the coalition together when the defence debate hots up this autumn. 
That is where the oldies in the LDP see an opening. These right-wingers want to bring back their old conservative pals who bolted from the LDP with Ichiro Ozawa in 1992.A grand alliance between the LDP and Mr Ozawa's dwindling New Frontier Party would provide more than enough support to bulldoze any legislation through the Diet that was needed for Japan to play a greater military role around the region. A hawkish former prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone (aged So), has been influential in trying to bring about such a deal. 
Mr Ozawa was once a power in Japanese politics. With desertions mounting within his ranks, his hope of regaining power is to get himself and his more loyal troops back within the LDP as soon as possible. If he does not do something before his party's annual meeting in December, his group is likely to split. 
Before any grand alliance among conservatives can take place, Mr Ozawa and some of the LDP's more geriatric right-wingers must first dislodge Mr Kato from his powerful position. As a first step, Seiroku Kajiyama, the LDP's chief cabinet secretary, a highly influential post, has threatened to resign, saying that, having done the job for 8 months, it is time for him to step down. His aim is to embarrass Mr Kato into having to resign as well. Mr Kajiyama has also been stirring up trouble by announcing that the new defence guidelines would allow Japan to support any American actions in the Taiwan Strait. That was intended as a further embarrassment for Mr Kato, who had just returned from explaining to the Chinese that the defence guidelines were for dealing with emergencies solely on the Korean peninsula. Mr Hashimoto himself is due to go to Beijing next week, and will presumably have to do some explaining. 
In normal circumstances, Mr Hashimoto would be expected to shuffle the members of the LDP's executive office as well as the cabinet after his reappointment A lot of cabinet posts will doubtless change hands in September. But getting rid of Mr Kato would upset the party's mainstream supporters. To avoid being outmanoeuvred, Mr Kato has asked the prime minister ""to use his own judgment"" when he shuffles the party's top posts. That is a Japanese ploy for cooling a bit of strife while simultaneously strengthening one's own position-by showing a willingness to accept the boss's decision no matter how unpalatable. 
The betting is that Mr Kato will keep his job-which will put him on the fast track to becoming prime minister after Mr Hashimoto. The betting also is that Mr Kajiyama will be arm-twisted to stay on as well. Mr Hashimoto wants to go down in history as the leader whose reforms turned Japan, scratching and screaming, into a more liberal, deregulated country.

While others quietly commemorate August 15th as the anniversary of the end of the second world war, the Chinese celebrate it for their ""victory over Japan"". It is a day to remember the Nanjing Massacre of 1937 and other atrocities committed by the imperial army during its occupation of China, when some 13m Chinese are said to have been killed. Not surprisingly, the image of Japan as the enemy remains etched indelibly in the Chinese collective consciousness. 
And it will continue to do so while Japanese politicians persist in claiming that the atrocities never happened, or make annual pilgrimages to Yasukuni shrine to pray for the souls of Japan's war dead and war criminals alike, or deliberately say provocative things just to stir up trouble. Japan's determination to glide over past crimes also makes it harder for Japan to play the responsible security role in Asia that its government wishes. Overshadowing the fourday visit by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese prime minister, to China starting on September 4th-officially to commemorate the 25th anniversary of normalisation of diplomatic ties-is the ""Kajiyama statement"". This has allowed the Chinese to claim that Japan is up to its old militaristic tricks again. 
As chief cabinet secretary, Seiroku Kajiyama knew perfectly well what he was doing. By announcing that the current revision of Japan's defence guidelines would allow it to send ships to support American military operations in the Taiwan Strait, Mr Kajiyama was out to embarrass Koichi Kato, a political rival within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the number-two man in the government. Mr Kato, a Mandarin-speaker and former diplomat, had just returned from explaining to officials in Beijing that the guidelines were being beefed up in large part to allow Japan to provide some logistical support should American troops have to deal with an emergency on the Korean peninsula. Japanese officials are reluctant to draw a clear geographical line separating areas where they will help America out and areas where they won't, for fear of causing new instabilities or tying their own hands too closely in a future crisis that affects Japan's interests in the region. 
To Mr Hashimoto's dismay, China reacted predictably. On a recent tour through Asia, the Chinese prime minister, Li Peng, described attempts by Japan to expand the scope of its security pact with America to cover the area around Taiwan as ""utterly unacceptable"". Were they to succeed, thundered Mr Li, Japan could expect relations with China to suffer irreparably. 
Of course, Mr Li's words were uttered more for consumption at home than for sending shudders through diplomatic saIons in Tokyo. With China's National People's Congress planned to start on September 12th, a bit of ritual Japanbashing was to be expected. Even so, Mr Hashimoto could be sure of a tough time this week explaining that Japan's revised defence policy is in no way intended to ""contain"" China. He was due to spend the first evening making this clear to Mr Li and to have a similar session with President Jiang Zemin on Friday. 
The Japanese side have decided that the best approach is to be frank. Mr Hashimoto outlined what he intends to say during a recent speech in Tokyo. The review of the America-Japan defence co-operation guidelines was to be described in detail. But, in exchange, China would be asked to be as open about its own military build-up. Mr Hashimoto intended stressing, once again, that Japan sees Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese territory, and endorses China's stated desire to see the Taiwan issue settled peacefully. 
Reassurances about Japan's joint security treaty with America aside, Mr Hashimoto's hosts want convincing on several other matters. They are keen to know what the government intends doing about the neo-nationalists within the LDP who not only insist on making regular visits to Yasukuni shrine, but also want to rewrite the history books again-purging them of any reference whatsoever to Japan's wartime atrocities. A Supreme Court ruling to let the Ministry of Education carry on censoring Japan's school textbooks has handed critics in Beijing yet another stick for prodding Mr Hashimoto (see box on next page). 
With preparations in hand to turn the forthcoming party congress into a curtainraiser for the new Jiang-Li era, nothing would give the Chinese leaders greater satisfaction than a full and abject official apology from Mr Hashimoto for Japan's militaristic past. Two recent Japanese prime ministers, Morihiro Hosokawa and Tomiichi Murayama, conveyed their remorse for the pain caused to the Chinese people and acknowledged that Japan had waged a war of aggression against China. And in an unprecedented statement during a royal visit to China in 1992, Emperor Akihito expressed his sorrow for Japan's wartime abuses. But none of these apologies has impressed the Chinese. 
Perhaps nothing ever will. ""Even if Mr Hashimoto read an apology written for him by President Jiang himself, it would still likely be deemed 'insufficient' by the Chinese,"" says Ralph Cossa, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Hawaii. Mr Hashimoto will probably limit himself to the kind of regret his predecessors offered-and then agree to get down to the real business of coughing up cash. 
Both sides know that China's professed fear of rising Japanese militarism is something of a predictable charade, designed to put the government in Tokyo on the defensive. It is part of the softening-up process that intensifies whenever China is seeking fresh yen loans from the Japanese government.Japan's current 58o billion ($4.8 billion) five-year loan programme for China has only a few more years to run. While in Beijing Mr Hashimoto will present his hosts with the latest Y200billion instalment. He will also announce plans for a fresh round of soft loans to help clean up China's filthy coal-burning power stations. 
The bill paid, and back in Tokyo, Mr Hashimoto will then be free to get on with the biggest task confronting his administration this year. That is to build a consensus at home so the revised defence guidelines for co-operating with American forces can be implemented without further ado. Mr Hashimoto has no trouble convincing the Chinese who, as firm believers in the ""corkin-the-bottle"" theory, much prefer to see Japan locked into a co-operative defence arrangement with America than left to go it militarily alone. A far bigger problem is similarly to convince the anti-defence-pact members of the governing coalition. ","HALF a century is clearly far too short a time for the Chinese to forget all the misery and degradation they suffered at the hands of the Japanese from 1931 to 1945 . While others quietly commemorate August 15th as the anniversary of the end of the second world war , the Chinese celebrate it for their "" victory over Japan "" . It is a day to remember the Nanjing Massacre of 1937 and other atrocities committed by the imperial army during its occupation of China , when some 13 m Chinese are said to have been killed . Not surprisingly , the image of Japan as the enemy remains etched indelibly in the Chinese collective consciousness . 
 And it will continue to do so while Japanese politicians persist in claiming that the atrocities never happened , or make annual pilgrimages to Yasukuni shrine to pray for the souls of Japan 's war dead and war criminals alike , or deliberately say provocative things just to stir up trouble . Japan 's determination to glide over past crimes also makes it harder for Japan to play the responsible security role in Asia that its government wishes . Overshadowing the fourday visit by Ryutaro Hashimoto , to China starting on September 4th - officially to commemorate the 25th anniversary of normalisation of diplomatic ties - is the "" Kajiyama statement "" . This has allowed the Chinese to claim that Japan is up to its old militaristic tricks again . 
 As chief cabinet secretary , Seiroku Kajiyama knew perfectly well what he was doing . By announcing that the current revision of Japan 's defence guidelines would allow it to send ships to support American military operations in the Taiwan Strait , Mr Kajiyama was out to embarrass Koichi Kato , a political rival within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) and the number - two man in the government . Mr Kato , a Mandarin - speaker and former diplomat , had just returned from explaining to officials in Beijing that the guidelines were being beefed up in large part to allow Japan to provide some logistical support should American troops have to deal with an emergency on the Korean peninsula . Japanese officials are reluctant to draw a clear geographical line separating areas where they will help America out and areas where they wo n't , for fear of causing new instabilities or tying their own hands too closely in a future crisis that affects Japan 's interests in the region . 
 To Ryutaro Hashimoto's dismay , China reacted predictably . On a recent tour through Asia , the Chinese prime minister , Li Peng , described attempts by Japan to expand the scope of its security pact with America to cover the area around Taiwan as "" utterly unacceptable "" . Were they to succeed , thundered Mr Li , Japan could expect relations with China to suffer irreparably . 
 Of course , Mr Li 's words were uttered more for consumption at home than for sending shudders through diplomatic saIons in Tokyo . With China 's National People 's Congress planned to start on September 12th , a bit of ritual Japanbashing was to be expected . Even so , Ryutaro Hashimoto could be sure of a tough time this week explaining that Japan 's revised defence policy is in no way intended to "" contain "" China . Ryutaro Hashimoto was due to spend the first evening making this clear to Mr Li and to have a similar session with President Jiang Zemin on Friday . 
 The Japanese side have decided that the best approach is to be frank . Ryutaro Hashimoto outlined what Ryutaro Hashimoto intends to say during a recent speech in Tokyo . The review of the America - Japan defence co - operation guidelines was to be described in detail . But , in exchange , China would be asked to be as open about its own military build - up . Ryutaro Hashimoto intended stressing , once again , that Japan sees Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese territory , and endorses China 's stated desire to see the Taiwan issue settled peacefully . 
 Reassurances about Japan 's joint security treaty with America aside , Ryutaro Hashimoto's hosts want convincing on several other matters . They are keen to know what the government intends doing about the neo - nationalists within the LDP who not only insist on making regular visits to Yasukuni shrine , but also want to rewrite the history books again - purging them of any reference whatsoever to Japan 's wartime atrocities . A Supreme Court ruling to let the Ministry of Education carry on censoring Japan 's school textbooks has handed critics in Beijing yet another stick for prodding Ryutaro Hashimoto ( see box on next page ) . 
 With preparations in hand to turn the forthcoming party congress into a curtainraiser for the new Jiang - Li era , nothing would give the Chinese leaders greater satisfaction than a full and abject official apology from Ryutaro Hashimoto for Japan 's militaristic past . Two recent Japanese prime ministers , Morihiro Hosokawa and Tomiichi Murayama , conveyed their remorse for the pain caused to the Chinese people and acknowledged that Japan had waged a war of aggression against China . And in an unprecedented statement during a royal visit to China in 1992 , Emperor Akihito expressed his sorrow for Japan 's wartime abuses . But none of these apologies has impressed the Chinese . 
 Perhaps nothing ever will . "" Even if Ryutaro Hashimoto read an apology written for Ryutaro Hashimoto by President Jiang himself , it would still likely be deemed ' insufficient ' by the Chinese , "" says Ralph Cossa , of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Hawaii . Ryutaro Hashimoto will probably limit Ryutaro Hashimoto to the kind of regret Ryutaro Hashimoto's predecessors offered - and then agree to get down to the real business of coughing up cash . 
 Both sides know that China 's professed fear of rising Japanese militarism is something of a predictable charade , designed to put the government in Tokyo on the defensive . It is part of the softening - up process that intensifies whenever China is seeking fresh yen loans from the Japanese government . Japan 's current 58o billion ( $ 4.8 billion ) five - year loan programme for China has only a few more years to run . While in Beijing Ryutaro Hashimoto will present Ryutaro Hashimoto's hosts with the latest Y200billion instalment . Ryutaro Hashimoto will also announce plans for a fresh round of soft loans to help clean up China 's filthy coal - burning power stations . 
 The bill paid , and back in Tokyo , Ryutaro Hashimoto will then be free to get on with the biggest task confronting Ryutaro Hashimoto's administration this year . That is to build a consensus at home so the revised defence guidelines for co - operating with American forces can be implemented without further ado . Ryutaro Hashimoto has no trouble convincing the Chinese who , as firm believers in the "" corkin - the - bottle "" theory , much prefer to see Japan locked into a co - operative defence arrangement with America than left to go it militarily alone . A far bigger problem is similarly to convince the anti - defence - pact members of the governing coalition .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,"Ryutaro Hashimoto , the Japanese prime minister",21,True

WITH the opinion polls giving him high marks for his first term as prime minister and no rivals daring to challenge him, Ryutaro Hashimoto secured a second term as president of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on September 8th. As head of the largest political party in the Diet (parliament), Mr Hashimoto now gets another two years as prime minister. That ritual out of the way, he has got down to the real work of cutting the deals on who is to be in his new cabinet-and, more importantly, who should hold the three top posts in the party executive (see box). 
The new line-up is going to be crucial to the prime minister's efforts to get his proposed legislation through the Diet. Mr Hashimoto wants to be remembered as the national leader whose vision and determination changed the social, financial and political course of the country; on a par with the dramatic reforms introduced by the Meiji leaders in 1868 and General Douglas MacArthur in 1947. 
The prime minister has six big reforms in view: of the administrative, fiscal, financial, welfare, economic and education systems. Each is formidable. In addition, he has to quell fighting within his own party, and keep together his rag-tag coalition with smaller parties that is necessary to shore up support in the upper house (where the LDP is 14 seats short of a majority). 
Overhauling the administrative system, in particular making the bureaucracy smaller and more responsive to public needs, is proving the most difficult nut to crack. Mr Hashimoto has been chairing the Administrative Reform Council himself to keep in line the panel of the good and the great. During the general election last year, he promised to halve the size of the government, reducing the number of ministries and agencies from zz to ten or so. 
In its preliminary report published on September 3rd, the council proposed squeezing the administrative machinery into 12 ministries and agencies, plus a more powerful cabinet office. This would absorb the old prime minister's office plus the cabinet secretariat and the Economic Planning Agency. The council also recommends hiving off the ministries' routine work to quasi-government organisations modelled on Britain's executive agencies. This leaner government, it is argued, would be better able to get on with the job of forming policy and drafting legislation. 
But where would all the unneeded bureaucrats go? Trade unions are insisting that civil servants transferred to the new quasi-government organisations be given the same pay, pensions and status as colleagues who remain behind. So the net result could well be no change in the overall size of the bureaucracy. Instead, there would simply be fewer, larger ministries with a plethora of administrative appendages. Meanwhile, opposition from bureaucrats themselves and their zoko gn (lobby groups of MPS) within the Diet is threatening to thwart the two most crucial aspects of Mr Hashimoto's administrative reforms-restructuring the finance ministry and privatising the key functions of the posts and telecommunications ministry. 
The council has stopped short of recommending that mail delivery be privatised. But it wants to see the post office's huge 0oo trillion ($830 billion) life insurance scheme (more than twice the size ofthe largest life insurance company) privatised by 2oo1, with the post office's even vaster savings bank (four times bigger than Japan's largest commercial bank) turned over to the private sector at some future date. 
This is not privatisation merely for the sake of it. There are good administrative reasons why the post office's funds should be kept well away from the government's grubby fingers. At present, the funds are recycled through the finance ministry's ""offbudget budgef' known as FILP(fiscal investment and loan programme). Among other things, one of the finance ministry's leading uses of FILP funds is to maintain a welter of redundant public corporations, whose main purpose these days is to provide cushy jobs for civil servants in their later years. 
Unfortunately for Mr Hashimoto, he is unlikely to be granted an open season for agency shooting. Many of his party colleagues are heavily indebted to the grassroots organisation run by regional post-office chiefs, which can be relied upon to get out the vote come election time. Fearing they will lose the postal workers' support in next summer's upper-house election, a vociferous group within the LDP is determined to kill any attempt to break up the posts and telecommunications ministry. 
For reformers, however, an even bigger disappointment is the council's failure to strip the finance ministry of its financial policy-making prerogatives. The ministry managed to bamboozle the council into believing that it needed to retain its authority over financial as well as fiscal policy, despite the wishes of Mr Hashimoto and his party's coalition partners. It was because of conflict between the ministry's financial and fiscal responsibilities (which led to the asset-inflated bubble economy a decade ago and the subsequent banking mess) that administrative reform became popular in the first place. 
Piqued, Mr Hashimoto is now suggesting that the finance ministry be stripped of its tax-collecting powers instead. A merger between the ministry's tax agency and the prefectural governments' 140,ooo taxmen is being talked about. However, being such a patent non-starter, the proposal can only mean that the prime minister is losing patience. It does rather seem as though the cornerstone of Mr Hashimoto's precious reform package is slowly but surely turning into something as wobbly as jelly. ","TOKYO

JAPAN'S prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, worries about confusion. 
After his re-election as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) earlier this month, Mr Hashimoto said his decision to make Koko Sato a member of his new cabinet had caused ""a lot of confusion"" among the public, and for that he apologised. Mr Hashimoto apologised for creating even more confusion when Mr Sato resigned on September 22nd after only la days in the job. 
The Japanese public, however, are less confused than amazed that Mr Sato was ever appointed in the first place. Mr Sato was convicted of taking bribes in a scandal involving Lockheed in the early 1970s, and given a two-year suspended prison sentence. To add to their amazement, Mr Sato, every inch a politician of the old school, was put in charge of administrative reform (short-hand for slimming down the bureaucracy). 
The kerfuffle has weakened both the prime minister and the party. The LDP'S two coalition allies objected to Mr Sato's appointment; newspaper editorials thundered their disapproval, and the cabinet's popularity ratings fell from 53% to 35%, according to a poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. 
What now? Although Mr Sato has been replaced by Sadatoshi Ozato, an uncontroversial but uninspired choice, the aftershocks will rumble on. On September 25th, in a further blow to Mr Hashimoto, Ihei Ochi, the agriculture minister, resigned for reasons of ill health. Mr Sato was foisted on the prime minister by Yasuhiro Nakasone, the de facto leader of a faction within the LDP. That Mr Hashimoto was unable to refuse shows that the factions wield as much power as they ever did. 
As a result, Mr Hashimoto's image as a strong man has taken something of a battering. His clout within the LDP rested in part on his popular appeal-and the lack of an obvious alternative. Yet Mr Sato's appointment to such a sensitive job suggests both the prime minister and his party were prepared blithely to ignore public opinion. 
Perhaps no more. The opposition parties smell blood and, emboldened by Mr Sato's resignation, may well step up attacks on other ministers. Three of them, including the new foreign minister, Keizo Obuchi, are accused of taking bribes from an Osaka-based oil trader. They deny the charges.

1997-10-11,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224086981/fulltext/A70019FDE9934B00PQ/57?accountid=14657,"South-East Asia's foundering economies need help. Their biggest investor has plenty of reasons to offer it 
THERE was an audience with the emperor. There was a big dinner. There were talks with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese prime minister. Hobnobbing with the great and good is always a treat, of course; but although this week's three-day visit by the Thai prime minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, was presented as merely cementing relations between the two countries, there was much more to it than that. It is exaggerating only a bit to say that Japanese investment drove South-East Asia's economies to prosperity. The Japanese are thus acutely concerned about the rumbling crisis on their doorstep, while their Asian friends, Thailand in particular, are desperate that Japanese banks and manufacturers do not react to the region's present turmoil by investing and lending less. 
In principle, Japan should hardly be bothered about what happens to the four countries-Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia-whose currencies have recently been ravaged. Their combined output is but a tenth of Japan's and they take only 12% of Japanese exports. Even if they buy less, say most economists, Japan's GDP would slow by only o.3-.4% as a result. But for an economy that shrank by 2.9% in the second quarter, and may be lucky to grow 1% over the entire year, such a potential drag on growth is anything but insignificant. Out of pure self-interest, the Japanese are doing all they can to help South-East Asia overcome its crisis. 
Tokyo's concern can be gauged from the fact that the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank contributed $4 billion of the $17.2 billion bail-out for Thailand co-ordinated by the IMF at the beginning of August. This is the largest sum EXIM Bank has ever lent. The government has also encouraged private banks to roll over many of their loans to Thai companies that have fallen due (which, some say, may be 8o% of their Thai loan books). All of this, according to a Thai central banker, may not be enough to steady Thailand's precarious financial sector. That will require another $io billion or so. The Thais consider Japan the obvious place to find the extra cash. This may explain why top Thai officials found it worthwhile to meet with three big private Japanese banks-Sakura, Sumitomo and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi-as well as to drop in on EXIM Bank. 
Investors in Japanese shares are also concerned. Although Asia accounts for only about 4% of the overall earnings of Japanese companies, car makers and manufacturers of electrical machinery have a particularly big exposure in South-East Asia. Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, reckons that these sectors account for more than a third of . this year's expected growth in Japanese corporate profits. If demand in these countries falls further, so, almost certainly, will such companies' earnings. 
It is not just Japan's manufacturers that are exposed. Japanese banks competed against each other to finance growth in Asia, especially in Thailand. Of that country's $70 billion of external private debts, $37.5 billion are to Japanese banks, according to the Bank for International Settlements. In Indonesia, which this week saw its currency plunge (see box on next page), around $22 billion of the officially reported $55 billion of foreign debt is owed to Japanese banks, and some analysts think that the country's true foreign indebtedness is much greater. 
These numbers need some context. Although they probably underestimate Japanese banks' true exposures, they are small compared with the banks' domestic lending. And perhaps a third of loans are to Japanese companies operating in the region. Still, the further their currencies fall, the greater the South-East Asian countries' foreign debt burdens become and the greater the risk of default. In Thailand alone, some $40 billion of private foreign-currency debts fall due in the next 12 months. And rumours circulate in Bangkok of a moratorium on debt payments. This would sting Japanese banks, still struggling to cope with their domestic bad loans. In all, such worries could give an already shaky Japanese stockmarket the vapours. 
Sending jobs abroad 
So it matters a lot to Japan what happens in South-East Asia. Equally, Japanese companies' reaction to the turmoil is crucial to the economic health of South-East Asia. Last year, Japanese companies invested about $5.7 billion in factories or property developments in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. This represents just over a third of all foreign direct investment in the region last year, and far more in Thailand (see charts on next pages One in seven manufacturing workers in Thailand is employed by a Japanese firm. Matsushita, a consumer-electronics firm, alone accounts for 4% of Malaysia's GDP; a fifth of Malaysia's new manufacturing jobs in the 199os are at Japanese companies. 
In the past, says Chihung Kwan, an economist at Nomura Research Institute, Japanese investment in Asia has been driven mainly by the level of the yen against the American dollar. Since many Asian countries more or less pegged their currencies to the dollar, Japanese companies could use them as a cheap proxy for an American manufacturing base. The yen's fall against the dollar since April 1995, however, has diminished the incentive to use South-East Asia as an export base. 
This year's sharp devaluations against both the dollar and (to a lesser extent) the yen, should make such investments look more attractive. But, argues Mr Kwan, it is not just the level of their currencies that matters, but how volatile they are against the dollar. ""The myth of the dollar peg has been broken,"" he says. Given the instability that pegging has caused, these countries are unlikely to fix their currencies again soon, so volatility will be a continuing fact of life. 
Yet Japanese manufacturers have not been using South-East Asia only, or even mainly, as a cheap base for exports to elsewhere in the world. Many have invested in the region because economies there have been growing fast and trade barriers between them are coming down. More than 70% of the products that Japanese companies produce in Asia are now sold within the region. So Japanese manufacturing companies are very exposed to any slowing of local demand. This was, for some products, happening anyway. Car sales in Thailand between January and June fell 14.5% at an annual rate, and car makers say they expect worse to come. Consumer electronics will presumably go the same way. 
Demand would fall further were there a credit crunch. This is already under way in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. And that is where Japan's banks again come into the picture. Unless they are prepared to lend, investment, and with it growth, will slump. That would create a vicious downward spiral, in which lower growth led to even less new investment. Japan and the South-East Asian countries are all desperate to avoid that. They will be hard-pressed to do so. ","South-East Asia's foundering economies need help. Their biggest investor has plenty of reasons to offer it 
THERE was an audience with the emperor. There was a big dinner. There were talks with Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese prime minister. Hobnobbing with the great and good is always a treat, of course; but although this week's three-day visit by the Thai prime minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, was presented as merely cementing relations between the two countries, there was much more to it than that. It is exaggerating only a bit to say that Japanese investment drove South-East Asia's economies to prosperity. The Japanese are thus acutely concerned about the rumbling crisis on their doorstep, while their Asian friends, Thailand in particular, are desperate that Japanese banks and manufacturers do not react to the region's present turmoil by investing and lending less. 
In principle, Japan should hardly be bothered about what happens to the four countries-Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia-whose currencies have recently been ravaged. Their combined output is but a tenth of Japan's and they take only 12% of Japanese exports. Even if they buy less, say most economists, Japan's GDP would slow by only o.3-.4% as a result. But for an economy that shrank by 2.9% in the second quarter, and may be lucky to grow 1% over the entire year, such a potential drag on growth is anything but insignificant. Out of pure self-interest, the Japanese are doing all they can to help South-East Asia overcome its crisis. 
Tokyo's concern can be gauged from the fact that the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank contributed $4 billion of the $17.2 billion bail-out for Thailand co-ordinated by the IMF at the beginning of August. This is the largest sum EXIM Bank has ever lent. The government has also encouraged private banks to roll over many of their loans to Thai companies that have fallen due (which, some say, may be 8o% of their Thai loan books). All of this, according to a Thai central banker, may not be enough to steady Thailand's precarious financial sector. That will require another $io billion or so. The Thais consider Japan the obvious place to find the extra cash. This may explain why top Thai officials found it worthwhile to meet with three big private Japanese banks-Sakura, Sumitomo and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi-as well as to drop in on EXIM Bank. 
Investors in Japanese shares are also concerned. Although Asia accounts for only about 4% of the overall earnings of Japanese companies, car makers and manufacturers of electrical machinery have a particularly big exposure in South-East Asia. Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, reckons that these sectors account for more than a third of . this year's expected growth in Japanese corporate profits. If demand in these countries falls further, so, almost certainly, will such companies' earnings. 
It is not just Japan's manufacturers that are exposed. Japanese banks competed against each other to finance growth in Asia, especially in Thailand. Of that country's $70 billion of external private debts, $37.5 billion are to Japanese banks, according to the Bank for International Settlements. In Indonesia, which this week saw its currency plunge (see box on next page), around $22 billion of the officially reported $55 billion of foreign debt is owed to Japanese banks, and some analysts think that the country's true foreign indebtedness is much greater. 
These numbers need some context. Although they probably underestimate Japanese banks' true exposures, they are small compared with the banks' domestic lending. And perhaps a third of loans are to Japanese companies operating in the region. Still, the further their currencies fall, the greater the South-East Asian countries' foreign debt burdens become and the greater the risk of default. In Thailand alone, some $40 billion of private foreign-currency debts fall due in the next 12 months. And rumours circulate in Bangkok of a moratorium on debt payments. This would sting Japanese banks, still struggling to cope with their domestic bad loans. In all, such worries could give an already shaky Japanese stockmarket the vapours. 
Sending jobs abroad 
So it matters a lot to Japan what happens in South-East Asia. Equally, Japanese companies' reaction to the turmoil is crucial to the economic health of South-East Asia. Last year, Japanese companies invested about $5.7 billion in factories or property developments in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. This represents just over a third of all foreign direct investment in the region last year, and far more in Thailand (see charts on next pages One in seven manufacturing workers in Thailand is employed by a Japanese firm. Matsushita, a consumer-electronics firm, alone accounts for 4% of Malaysia's GDP; a fifth of Malaysia's new manufacturing jobs in the 199os are at Japanese companies. 
In the past, says Chihung Kwan, an economist at Nomura Research Institute, Japanese investment in Asia has been driven mainly by the level of the yen against the American dollar. Since many Asian countries more or less pegged their currencies to the dollar, Japanese companies could use them as a cheap proxy for an American manufacturing base. The yen's fall against the dollar since April 1995, however, has diminished the incentive to use South-East Asia as an export base. 
This year's sharp devaluations against both the dollar and (to a lesser extent) the yen, should make such investments look more attractive. But, argues Mr Kwan, it is not just the level of their currencies that matters, but how volatile they are against the dollar. ""The myth of the dollar peg has been broken,"" he says. Given the instability that pegging has caused, these countries are unlikely to fix their currencies again soon, so volatility will be a continuing fact of life. 
Yet Japanese manufacturers have not been using South-East Asia only, or even mainly, as a cheap base for exports to elsewhere in the world. Many have invested in the region because economies there have been growing fast and trade barriers between them are coming down. More than 70% of the products that Japanese companies produce in Asia are now sold within the region. So Japanese manufacturing companies are very exposed to any slowing of local demand. This was, for some products, happening anyway. Car sales in Thailand between January and June fell 14.5% at an annual rate, and car makers say they expect worse to come. Consumer electronics will presumably go the same way. 
Demand would fall further were there a credit crunch. This is already under way in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. And that is where Japan's banks again come into the picture. Unless they are prepared to lend, investment, and with it growth, will slump. That would create a vicious downward spiral, in which lower growth led to even less new investment. Japan and the South-East Asian countries are all desperate to avoid that. They will be hard-pressed to do so. ",740,Japan,A29-8197,,False,,0,True

For one thing, it would get up to a third of Japan's 855,000 bureaucrats off the government payroll. But the prime minister is facing strong opposition to the idea within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). With a tough upper-house election looming next summer, politicians do not want to be seen threatening the existence of the post office's 24,600 branches, conjuring up visions of little old ladies having to travel farther to pay insurance contributions or withdraw cash. Worse, LDP backbenchers fear losing the handouts and support they receive at election time from the postmasters' association and the postal unions. Postmasters carry tremendous prestige in Japan. Most are descendants of the rich and influential individuals who bought the title when the service was established in 1871. 
The rebellion within the LDP would have been unthinkable a month ago, when Mr Hashimoto was riding high in the public's esteem thanks to his plans for reform, including bringing the wayward bureaucracy to heel. But his popularity plunged overnight-from 53% to 35% in the Asahi Shimbun's opinion poll-after he allowed Koko Sato into his cabinet on September lith. Mr Sato, who was convicted of taking bribes during the Lockheed scandal of 1976, has since resigned from the cabinet. But the public has yet to forgive Mr Hashimoto for capitulating to nefarious forces within the LDP hierarchy. Lacking a power base of his own, Mr Hashimoto has only the power of his office to silence the party plotters who would do him down. With his public support diminished, the prime minister now faces a sizeable insurrection in the party over post-office privatisation. 
With Y230 trillion ($1.9 trillion) in deposits, Japan's postal-savings business (yucho) is the largest bank in the world. Its life-insurance scheme (kampo) has some y100 trillion worth of assets, making it more than twice the size of Nippon Lifeitself the world's largest conventional insurance company. The bulk of the money collected by the post office is deposited with the Ministry of Finance's trust-fund office, where it is used to finance Japan's ""off-budget"" expenditures, known as FILP (fiscal investment and loan programme). Among other things, FILP funnels money to the building industry (paving Japan's river beds is the latest wheeze) as well as to dozens of state-owned companies that have long ceased to serve any useful purpose other than to provide lucrative retirement jobs for ageing bureaucrats. 
As Mr Hashimoto sees it, the main purpose of privatising the post office is to divert to the private sector a Niagara of public cash in a bid to impose some much-needed financial discipline on the ministries and their zoku giin (tribe members) within the LDP. Cutting the number of bureaucrats by a third would save the country Y1.4 trillion a year in wage costs alone. In an interim report, the Administrative Reform Councila 15-member panel of the great and the good chaired by the prime minister himself-recommended that the task of mail delivery be left untouched but that the post office's life-insurance business be privatised by 2001, with savings to be privatised later. 
The political tribe within the LDP that does the postal ministry's bidding has now had its instructions. All three parts of the post office-mail, savings and insurancemust be kept in the governments hands. Even Koichi Kato, the party's influential secretary-general and the main force behind the Hashimoto cabinet's existence, has come out strongly against post-office privatisation. Mr Kato is adamant about keeping the small but important Social Democratic Party within the governing coalition. The socialists want nothing to do with privatising any part of the post office. 
Mr Hashimoto knows that, if he is to maintain the core of the reform programme he has staked his career on, then all those savings and insurance premiums cannot be left sloshing around the public sector. As a compromise, political insiders expect that the post office will be allowed to remain intact. But it will probably have to accept some reduction-20% is talked about-in manning levels as part of the price of being let offthe hook. Moreover, interest rates on savings could well be pegged below those offered by commercial banks. And the bonuses paid to postal workers for selling insurance may be abolished. 
The tricky part is what to do with all the postal funds accumulating in the Ministry of Finance's trust-fund office. Mr Hashimoto is expected to insist that they should at least be managed by a professional outside firm instead of a bunch of amateurs at the ministry. The point of privatising the post office in the first place was to get those funds out of the government's grubby fingers-and, in the process, give the people a better return on their savings. The prime minister could yet salvage a bit of public kudos from a political disaster. ","PRIVATISING the post office would seem an obvious step in Ryutaro Hashimoto's plans for reform .

Because of pessimism about the economy, yields on Japanese-government bonds are only a whisker above the lowest in history (in Genoa in 1619). So Ryutaro Hashimoto has probably been feeling rather intimidated of late. 
The reception given to the economic reforms proposed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on October 21st is unlikely to make the prime minister feel better. Businessmen groaned, commentators griped, the stockmarket swooned (though temporarily; it jumped sharply the next day) and bond yields are still poised to beat that Genoan record. There were no big proposals in the package, scarcely any small ones (save one to have more public holidays on a Monday so that people can have more long weekends to spend money), and little, in the short term at least, to coax people to raid their savings. Mr Hashimoto's main proposals were a bit more deregulation in telecommunications; a few less taxes on holding, buying and selling land; some help for medium-sized and small companies; and an intention (no more) to reduce Japan's extravagant corporate taxes. No income-tax cuts, no more public-works spending. Two other packages are due this year, but the government does not appear to have the stomach for deregulation.

Deregulation is the key in the medium term; and the reason why there were few deregulatory proposals this week may be because there have already been moves in this direction. Low and falling land prices have had a big impact on confidence. This explains why Mr Hashimoto made a few extra proposals to try to deregulate the property market.

If so, the big players in North-East Asia have been putting on quite a show. Shortly after China's president, Jiang Zemin, met Bill Clinton late last month, Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, played host to Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, for less formal talks in Siberia. This week, Mr Yeltsin was in Beijing for a friendly chat (and ardent bearhugs) with Mr Jiang. He also held meetings with hina's prime minister, Li Peng, who later flew to Tokyo to meet Mr Hashimoto and to have an audience with Japan's Emperor Akihito. 
All these summits generated their fair share of froth-witness the spectacle of Mr Jiang strumming a guitar in Hawaii, or Mr Yeltsin and Mr Hashimoto going fishing in the Siberian forests. But they produced some genuine achievements too, not least for China. Indeed, it is China's growing power and purpose in the region that provide much of the impetus behind the recent flurry of high-level diplomacy. 
China and Russia may still find it hard to boost their anaemic trade, but they managed to put an end of sorts to a pesky dispute over border demarcation (despite continuing to disagree on two intractable border prob lems). In the 196os, China and the Soviet Union were involved in fighting at their borders. So China at least will be glad of one less problem to worry about in the north as it looks south in its search for greater regional influence. Russia and Japan had less success with their territorial dispute, over four small islands occupied by Russia since the end of the second world war. But at least they declared their intention to try to settle the disagreement within three years. 
While in the United States, Mr Jiang agreed to suspend China's nuclear co-operation with Iran. In return, Mr Clinton moved to lift a ban on the sale of American nuclear-energy technology to China. While China gets better technology, American companies could win contracts worth billions of dollars in coming years. 
Beyond all the agreements and statements, the spate of meetings also offer a sketch of how relations between these four countries are beginning to take shape. As a Kremlin spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, put it shortly before leaving for Beijing: ""The timing of all these visits is a coincidence, but a very symbolic one"" Russia, still uneasy about NATO'S ex ansion to its west, is making clear that it has other eastern strings to its foreign-policy bow. But the symbolism of all these visits is not lost on China's leaders either. In the new web being woven from the dignitaries' criss-crossing flight paths, there is a clearly discernible hub: Beijing. 
Big-power relations in East Asia are shifting in dramatic if indeterminate ways. Few would deny that America remains the predominant power to be reckoned with in the region, but no one is sure either how soon China's rising influence will be felt, or how it will be managed. Judging by its dip lomatic performance this month, China has decided that winning friends and influencing people requires a lighter touch. 
That contrasts sharply with the bluster that blew from Beijing last year. Most dramatic was the plunge in relations with the United States after China drew American warships to the Taiwan Strait with a series of intimidating missile tests in the shipping lanes off Taiwan. 
Relations between China and Japan, meanwhile, soured sharply last year after Japan and America reaffirmed their security alliance and then went to work on new military guidelines, published earlier this year, that give Japan a greater supporting role (though not a fighting one) in the event of future crises in the region. As tensions rose, Japan and China also traded words over disputed islands in the East China Sea (called the Diaoyus by China, the Senkakus by Japan). 
Staying cool 
Both countries have since sought to cool tempers. The United States and Japan have insisted that their guidelines are aimed neither at China nor at any other country. Indeed,Japan especially has gone to great lengths to convince China of this. But it will not give China the one assurance it wants: an explicit promise to exclude Taiwan from the scope of the security agreement. Both Japan and America have offered to include China in three-sided discussions, hoping by doing so to demonstrate openness; but China still says, officially anyway, thatjapan's explanations on the security pact are ""obscure and unconvincing"". Nonetheless, there has been an important softening in China's attitude. Issues that last year were treated as trouble spots are, say diplomats, this year being swept aside. 
China also appears eager to minimise its differences with the United States, although Congress, with its steady drip of anti-China motions, makes this difficult. But even in America, playing statesman has been lucrative for Mr Jiang, since he enjoys nearly total control over the press coverage at home of his exploits abroad, all of which add to his stature. 
To have Mr Clinton come calling, as is due to happen next year, will add to Mr Jiang's political triumphs. These include not only his American visit, but also his smooth handling of Deng Xiaoping's death, the handover of Hong Kong and the 15th congress of China's Communist Party. Successes such as these at home, say Chinese diplomats, have given Mr Jiang the confidence to run foreign policy according to his own pragmatic instincts and to resist hardline pressure. 
But where might Mr Jiang's pragmatic instincts lead? China's stated aim is a more multipolar region. Implicit in that phrase is a challenge to America's role as the world's only superpower. Rather than challenge American power head-on, China is putting on a friendly regional face. China's offer of money to help sort out South-East Asia's financial problems was a first-and one that people in the region have begun to contrast, however mistakenly, with what they see as America's aloofness from their problems. 
Meanwhile, China places great emphasis on the ""strategic perspective"" of its ties with the region's bigger powers, America, Russia and Japan. And the Chinese insist that no one partnership is directed at any other country. Given the long-standing rivalries in the region, however, and China's desire to play a bigger regional role, that does not sound very convincing.

HIS silence has been deafening. In April, a few words from Eisuke Sakakibara of Japan's finance ministry arguing that the markets were too pessimistic about the Japanese economy were sufficient to reverse a sharp fall in the currency. Then, slowly, the yen began falling again. The retreat is now in danger of becoming a rout. This week a dollar fetched Y26, compared with Y115 at the end of June. Some Tokyo economists think that the yen is about to plunge. Yet from ""Mr Yen"" there has been not a peep. 
The implication is clear: both the finance ministry and the Bank of Japan would not mind if the yen fell further. Mr Sakakibara's optimism was, it transpires, premature. Japan's economy shrank at an annual rate of 11.2% in the second quarter of this year. Although it is likely to bounce back in the third quarter, the economy is undeniably in poor shape, principally because of weak domestic demand. In April the government raised taxes and cut public spending. Consumers have been keener to save than to spend. As for companies, they have preferred to pay off debts rather than invest in new buildings and equipment. 
Until recently, the only prop for Japan's economy, thanks to a cheapening yen, has been its companies ability to export cars, electronic gadgets and so forth overseas. Even that prop has been crumbling as other Asian countries have had their currencies mauled. Almost half of Japanese exports go to the rest of Asia. As long as Asia's financial crisis remained confined to the small South-East Asian countries that account for a bit more than 12% of Japan's exports, the drag on its economy was minor; now that South Korea, which accounts for about 7% of Japanese exports, has been sucked into the crisis, the prospects for Japan's exporters have become grimmer. 
Small wonder, then, that pessimism reigns in Japan. The stockmarket has fallen by a quarter since June; on November 13th, the Nikkei 225 average reached 15,427, its lowest level for over two years. Long-term interest rates are the lowest anywhere in recorded history. Economists have been scrambling to reduce their growth forecasts: having thought in June that the economy would grow by 3.1% next year, Jesper Koll of J.P. Morgan trimmed his prediction to 2.5% in September. Now he thinks that it will grow by a mere 1.2%. 
Japan's options are limited. Consumers and companies seem unwilling to spend much more. The government wants to spend less. Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, has staked his reputation on getting Japan's finances, which are in a horrible mess, into better shape. A bill to reduce the government deficit from 7% to 3% of GDP by 2003 is working its way through the Diet, Japan's parliament. The American government wants Japan to backtrack on these spending cuts, but even if it does, noone thinks that the Japanese government will start spending much more again. 
Which leaves exports. The catch, points out Peter Tasker, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, is that, thanks to the collapse of currencies elsewhere in Asia, the yen has actually appreciated by 9% in trade-weighted terms over the past year. An increase in exports to America and Asia therefore requires an even weaker yen. 
America seems willing to put up with this. It does not want to tip Japan, whose GDP is much larger than the rest of Asia put together, into recession. Because America's economy is still growing at a brisk rate, its officials are content with a stronger dollar, which should help slow growth and reduce the threat of higher inflation. Hence the lack of the traditional tirade from Washington. That view might change should the American economy run out of steam. But even then, Japan is probably willing to weather hectoring by American officials, as it has done in the past. 
There are plenty of other reasons why the yen might fall further. One is that there is scant incentive to buy Japanese financial assets. In the past, the level of the yen against the dollar was best explained by changes in relative interest rates between the two countries. If, say, investors expect American rates to rise and Japanese ones to fall, they will switch investments out of yen and into higher-yielding dollars, pushing up the dollar's value. 
Investors may soon reach just this conclusion. America's Federal Reserve might put up interest rates soon because of the strength of the economy. There are even mutterings at the Bank of Japan about reducing Japanese interest rates from their current level of 0.5%. 
But it is not only the relative level of Japanese rates that is important now, but their absolute level. Since Japan has the lowest interest rates ever, investors are earning the lowest ever returns. Pension funds in a country ageing as fast as Japan can ill afford this. Nor, since they offer a guaranteed 2.5% a year on new contracts compared with a maximum ten-year bond yield of a little over 2%, can its life insurers. Logic dictates that they take advantage of the better yields offered by foreign assets. Tadashi Nakamae, an economist, thinks that, as a result of capital outflows, the yen could fall to Yi So swiftly. 
Yet logic, it seems, has played little part in Japanese investors' decisions lately. They have invested surprisingly little in foreign assets after a splurge earlier this year. Many market watchers think that what needs explaining is not why the yen will fall further, but why it has not done so already. 
One theory is that investors' have developed an extreme aversion to risk. Along with the economy and the stockmarket, financial institutions are in such bad shape that Japanese savers prefer Japanese government bonds to shares and other investments, no matter their paltry yield. Investors are, in the words of Marshall Gittler, a strategist at sBc Warburg, most concerned ""with the return of their principal, not with return on principal"". This risk aversion applies with equal force to foreign assets because, if they bought them, savers would also run the risk that the yen might rise, making such investments less valuable. 
Mr Sakakibara is also to blame. His yenboosting comments earlier this year caused big losses on foreign bonds for many investors. He seems to have been worried about a big outflow of capital from Japan. But in a country where there is an excess of savings, that is exactly what is required to bump up returns for investors. Mr Sakakibara, the man who is responsible for plans to get rid of the vestiges of exchange controls next April, should, of all people, know better. With luck, his silence will not be shortlived.

THE Japanese finance ministry has long and vehemently insisted that the country's 20 biggest banks are too big to fail. Oops. As of November 17th, with the collapse of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank-the country's tenth-largest city (ie, big commercial) bank-there are only 19 on that list The Tokyo stockmarket decided that this was a jolly good thing, for it showed that the financial authorities finally had a template and, possibly, public money to deal with the festering banking crisis. Having fallen by a quarter since the beginning of the year, the Nikkei 225 average promptly rebounded by 8% or 1,200 points-the fourthlargest rise in its history. 
So much for wishful thinking. Most of the surge in the Nikkei, it seems, came from short-sellers who needed to replace the borrowed shares that they had sold the week before in the (temporarily wrong) expectation that the market would slide further. The finance ministry appeared to be operating less from a new template than from old habit, and the promised flow of money dried up when Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, asserted: ""I have never said that public funds would be used."" So on November 19th the Nikkei sobered up and dropped by 5.3%. And after a few days in which it seemed that Japan was finally ready to confront its long-running banking crisis head on, reality returned: Japan's banks are still in trouble, and the government is still unsure what to do about it. 
Certainly, there is little evidence of new thinking from the finance ministry. Until the 11th hour, it had been trying to armtwist healthier institutions into taking over Hokkaido Takushoku, known in Sapporo, its home, as ""Takugin"". Plans to merge the troubled bank with Hokkaido Bank came to naught in September. So did attempts to get life-insurance companies to inject a further Y150 billion ($1.2 billion) into the bank's capital base. In the end, as depositors fled and other banks grew reluctant to lend to Hokkaido Takushoku, the authorities had to accept the inevitable. 
Takugin's is the biggest financial collapse in Japanese history. No one yet knows how big; the finance ministry's inspectors are only half way through the audit they started a month ago. Takugin had Y6.8 trillion worth of deposits on its books last March and, officially, its non-performing loans amounted to Y934 billion. That makes its failure nearly three times larger than Japan's previous record-holder. The full story maybe much worse. Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's top financial daily, reckoned recently that 22% of the bank's loans were dodgy. This would bring the amount of non-performers to Y1.5 trillion. 
Takugin's profitable business is likely to end up with Hokuyo Bank, a healthy midsized institution in Sapporo, while most of the non-performing loans will be inherited by the Deposit Insurance Corporation, an emergency pool funded mainly by other banks. The Bank of Japan, the central bank, has smoothed the process by lending Takugin a staggering Y1.12 trillion, with more likely to follow. The central bank can lend any amount if a bankruptcy threatens the stability of the country's financial system. ""A clear case of systemic risk existed,"" insists a senior Bank of Japan official. 
The hitch in all this is that the Deposit Insurance Corporation itself is not rolling in money. It is thought to be in the red by as much as Y21O billion, although it is empowered to borrow up to Y2 trillion from the Bank of Japan. Banks may also face higher premiums for deposit insurance. But, one way or another, the public will have to foot the bill. 
Therein lies the problem. Having been savaged by an outraged electorate over the liquidation of seven jusen, or mortgage companies, last year, and with a crucial up per-house election due next summer, Japanese politicians have been understandably nervous about even hinting that public money is needed to sort out Japan's banking mess. Behind closed doors that is, however, precisely what the government has been talking about for months. One rumour is that it will set up a Securities Holding Fund to buy preferred stock issued by the banks. The Y8 trillion being mooted would come from savings at the post office, which is owned by the government. 
Whatever the outcome,James Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo, reckons that it will take Y8 trillion of public money just to solve bad-loan problems among Japan's 19 remaining big banks. That is nearly 12 times greater than the amount of public money (Y685 billion) involved in the jusen fiasco-and it still leaves the messes at dozens of smaller banks unresolved. 
The good news in all this is that the finance ministry has accepted the demise of its cherished ""convoy system"", which has forced stronger financial institutions to help their weaker brethren. With financial deregulation looming, winners are no longer willing to support losers. Two implications follow. One is that the gap between good and bad banks will widen further as funds are pulled away from weaker institutions. The second is that investors in failed banks can expect to lose their shirts. A suspicious public is unlikely to accept a government bail-out for the banks unless it is clear that, unlike in the jusen affair, shareholders are bearing the pain.

1997-11-29,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224081925/fulltext/4569C6D6E2D1440CPQ/57?accountid=14657,"Japan's financial system is melting down. It is unclear whether the government can act quickly enough to stop it 
NO, SAID both the governor of the Bank of Japan and the finance minister, with straight faces, Yamaichi Securities was not insolvent. Why, then, did Japan's fourth-largest securities firm announce on November 24th that it would be closing? Yamaichi is done for, and everybody knows it. Plenty of other financial firms should be considered insolvent too. Six years after Japan's once-powerful banks began drowning in losses, the government at last seems prepared to let bad banks, insurers and stockbrokers fail. 
Earlier this month, Sanyo Securities, a middling securities firm, went under. On November 17th, Hokkaido Takushoku, a big commercial bank, followed suit. This week brought the collapse of Tokuyo, a tiddler, while Ashikaga, a big regional bank, begged its biggest shareholder, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, for assistance. No one thinks that these will be the last. Queues are forming outside weaker banks as worried depositors pull out their savings. Confidence in the financial system is collapsing. 
So serious has the crisis become that, at last, politicians and the finance ministry are discussing a subject long forbidden: injecting public money into the system. On November 27th, after much dithering, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, said that public funds would be used to solve the banking system's woes. But although that principle is now accepted, Mr Hashimoto has yet to put forth details. Whether the government can deliver a package that is both big enough and of the right sort to fix the financial system's problems remains an open question. 
Yamaichi's demise has been the immediate catalyst in this crisis. Once the biggest securities firm in Japan, the company's straits have been no secret: it has lost money in four of the past six years. But even as Yamaichi's problems mounted, it was widely assumed that the finance ministry would quietly arrange for a bank to take it over. The decision to allow a firm of Yamaichi's size and stature to fail came as a shock. More shocking still was the news that it had hidden huge losses from regulators by setting up dummy companies in the Cayman Islands. According to preliminary investigations, these amounted to 264 billion ($2 billion). There is more: according to a senior official at the finance ministry, ""Yamaichi may have used investors' money for its own purposes."" The amount involved is not known. 
Financial authorities feel the need to maintain the fiction that Yamaichi is solvent for three reasons. First, the Bank of Japan is not supposed to lend to insolvent institutions; insolvency would have made it hard for the central bank to lend Yamaichi the money to settle outstanding trades and to return investors' assets. 
Second, if it was insolvent, the authorities would have to dip into the Compensation Fund for Deposited Securities to repay investors, but the fund itself is almost out of money. 
Third, an insolvent Yamaichi would also be declared bankrupt, allowing the courts to seize control of its and clients' assets. That might make already jittery investors panic and could delay the settlement of deals still in the works, snarling up payment and settlement systems. 
Other securities firms have indulged in similar practices to Yamaichi's. Many are probably as ""solvent' as Yamaichi proved to be. ""It will not be the last to fail,"" says the finance ministry official. Indeed, if Yamaichi hid losses of such magnitude, investors reasoned, other firms may also have something nasty in the woodshed. On November 25th, the first day of trading after Yamaichi's collapse, the Nikkei zs average fell by 854 points, or 5.1%. Shares in all but the strongest financial institutions fell sharply again the next day. Although Daiwa Securities, Japan's second-largest broker, said on November 26th that it had no offbalance sheet losses, that did not stop its shares from falling by 20% more. Those in Nikko, the third-biggest broker, fell by almost as much. 
Dramatic as they are, the problems at Japan's brokers are insignificant compared with those of banks and life-insurance firms. Stockbrokers hold only a small amount of investors' savings, as shares account for only 4.5% of household financial assets. In contrast, 15.9% of household assets are on deposit at banks, and io% are invested in insurance policies. 
About those guarantees. . . 
Thirteen of the 19 biggest banks expect to report losses this year as a result of writing off bad loans. This week several big banks claimed yet again that the worst of their bad debt problems are behind them. Given the opacity of the banks' accounting, however, the markets do not trust this. The bigger, healthier banks will survive: shares in Tokyo-Mitsubishi, for example, have suffered little in the recent carnage. But investors are now dumping shares in any bank that has the remotest whiff of risk-particularly because the failure of Hokkaido Takushoku has made it clear that the finance ministry's ""guarantee"" of the top 20 banks applies only to depositors and creditors, not to shareholders. 
Even creditors are now none too sure about the worth of the ministry's guarantee. This has pushed up the banks' cost of borrowing. The ""Japan premium"", the extra rate at which Japanese banks must borrow in dollars compared with their healthier foreign counterparts, has risen to between half and one percentage point this week. For Nippon Credit Bank, it reached four percentage points. Some weaker Japanese banks are finding it prohibitively expensive to borrow even in yen. Few, if any, foreign banks will give them credit lines, and healthy domestic banks are refusing to lend to their weaker brethren. Nobody wants to buy the debentures issued by any of the long-term credit banks. The weaker banks can get cash only from the Bank of Japan, which now has Y3.6 trillion in loans to the banking system compared with just 373 billion at the end of October. 
Small wonder that shares in troubled banks have tumbled. Those in Yasuda Trust, which is part of the same keiretsu as Yamaichi, fell by 28% on November 25th as its debt was downgraded to junk by Standard 8 Poor's, a credit-rating agency. Shares in other big and deeply troubled banks such as Nippon Credit Bank, Long-Term Credit Bank and Daiwa Bank, fell as much. And they all fell further the next day. The market capitalisation of some of the weakest halved in two days. ""The markets are engineering the shutdown of banks. . . and that is very dangerous,"" says James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Barings. 
Mutual life insurers are in similarly dire straits. Not only are they the biggest holders of bank shares, but life insurers have given some Y434 billion in subordinated loans to brokers, and a whopping 14 trillion to banks. Subordinated loans are not covered by the finance ministry's guarantee. Should more banks and brokers go bust, life insurers are unlikely to get this money back. 
They are anyway in a pickle. Andrew Smithers, an independent London-based economist, reckons that, taken as a whole, the life-insurance industry is insolvent. Big companies, such as mighty Nippon Life, are reasonably robust. The smaller ones are anything but. One, Nissan Life, has already folded this year. Low interest rates, a mass cancellation of policies (which eats into cashflow) and a sinking stockmarket (which eats into unrealised gains on their equity portfolios), already mean that they are suffering a severe shortage of available funds. Some insurers own large amounts of American Treasury bonds, and there are fears in America that they will dump these to raise cash. This seems unlikely: firms that hope to survive have no choice but to hold on to their Treasuries, their most highyielding assets at present. 
The jitters of politicians and bureaucrats are understandable. For the first time since the beginning of 1996, when the finance ministry pushed through a highly unpopular package to liquidate seven huge mortgage companies, there is talk of using public money to solve the financial crisis. Politicians feel that the public fright over financial failures will override objections to bailing out the banks. 
The form that such public money would take is still undecided. One option is to set up a version of America's Resolution Trust Corporation, which inherited and sold off the assets of failed savings and loan associations in the early 199os. A second option, increasingly favoured by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, is to inject funds into the Deposit Insurance Corporation. Where it would get the money is unclear. One possible source is bonds guaranteed by the government. These would be bought by the finance ministry's trust-fund bureau, which manages*400 trillion of deposits in the postal savings system. A seemingly more favoured option is to get money directly from the Bank of Japan. 
How the money is injected is, in some ways, academic. The Deposit Insurance Corporation would not have the power to investigate banks and shut down those it deemed insolvent. It would only be able to dispose of banks' assets once they had gone bust. This creates a problem more serious than the one it purports to solve. Without clarity as to whether bad institutions will be closed, the capital markets will force all but the strongest of banks to pay a huge premium to borrow money. That may drive even relatively healthy banks to the wall. In a sign of just such a development, shares in Fuji Bank-by no means the worst-ofi of Japan's banking giants-did not trade for two days this week, so concerned has the market become about its health. 
Worse, politicians, whatever their newfound commitment to using public cash, seem content to fiddle while Rome burns. The details of the Liberal Democratic Party's scheme will not be announced until December ioth. Nothing is likely to become law until mid-January. Without huge injections of money from the Bank of Japan, a lot of institutions could go bust by them. ","Japan 's financial system is melting down . It is unclear whether the government can act quickly enough to stop it 
 NO , SAID both the governor of the Bank of Japan and the finance minister , with straight faces , Yamaichi Securities was not insolvent . Why , then , did Japan 's fourth - largest securities firm announce on November 24th that it would be closing ? Yamaichi is done for , and everybody knows it . Plenty of other financial firms should be considered insolvent too . Six years after Japan 's once - powerful banks began drowning in losses , the government at last seems prepared to let bad banks , insurers and stockbrokers fail . 
 Earlier this month , Sanyo Securities , a middling securities firm , went under . On November 17th , Hokkaido Takushoku , a big commercial bank , followed suit . This week brought the collapse of Tokuyo , a tiddler , while Ashikaga , a big regional bank , begged its biggest shareholder , Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi , for assistance . No one thinks that these will be the last . Queues are forming outside weaker banks as worried depositors pull out their savings . Confidence in the financial system is collapsing . 
 So serious has the crisis become that , at last , politicians and the finance ministry are discussing a subject long forbidden : injecting public money into the system . On November 27th , after much dithering , Ryutaro Hashimoto said that public funds would be used to solve the banking system 's woes . But although that principle is now accepted , Ryutaro Hashimoto has yet to put forth details . Whether the government can deliver a package that is both big enough and of the right sort to fix the financial system 's problems remains an open question . 
 Yamaichi 's demise has been the immediate catalyst in this crisis . Once the biggest securities firm in Japan , the company 's straits have been no secret : it has lost money in four of the past six years . But even as Yamaichi 's problems mounted , it was widely assumed that the finance ministry would quietly arrange for a bank to take it over . The decision to allow a firm of Yamaichi 's size and stature to fail came as a shock . More shocking still was the news that it had hidden huge losses from regulators by setting up dummy companies in the Cayman Islands . According to preliminary investigations , these amounted to 264 billion ( $ 2 billion ) . There is more : according to a senior official at the finance ministry , "" Yamaichi may have used investors ' money for its own purposes . "" The amount involved is not known . 
 Financial authorities feel the need to maintain the fiction that Yamaichi is solvent for three reasons . First , the Bank of Japan is not supposed to lend to insolvent institutions ; insolvency would have made it hard for the central bank to lend Yamaichi the money to settle outstanding trades and to return investors ' assets . 
 Second , if it was insolvent , the authorities would have to dip into the Compensation Fund for Deposited Securities to repay investors , but the fund itself is almost out of money . 
 Third , an insolvent Yamaichi would also be declared bankrupt , allowing the courts to seize control of its and clients ' assets . That might make already jittery investors panic and could delay the settlement of deals still in the works , snarling up payment and settlement systems . 
 Other securities firms have indulged in similar practices to Yamaichi 's . Many are probably as "" solvent ' as Yamaichi proved to be . "" It will not be the last to fail , "" says the finance ministry official . Indeed , if Yamaichi hid losses of such magnitude , investors reasoned , other firms may also have something nasty in the woodshed . On November 25th , the first day of trading after Yamaichi 's collapse , the Nikkei zs average fell by 854 points , or 5.1 % . Shares in all but the strongest financial institutions fell sharply again the next day . Although Daiwa Securities , Japan 's second - largest broker , said on November 26th that it had no offbalance sheet losses , that did not stop its shares from falling by 20 % more . Those in Nikko , the third - biggest broker , fell by almost as much . 
 Dramatic as they are , the problems at Japan 's brokers are insignificant compared with those of banks and life - insurance firms . Stockbrokers hold only a small amount of investors ' savings , as shares account for only 4.5 % of household financial assets . In contrast , 15.9 % of household assets are on deposit at banks , and io% are invested in insurance policies . 
 About those guarantees . . . 
 Thirteen of the 19 biggest banks expect to report losses this year as a result of writing off bad loans . This week several big banks claimed yet again that the worst of their bad debt problems are behind them . Given the opacity of the banks ' accounting , however , the markets do not trust this . The bigger , healthier banks will survive : shares in Tokyo - Mitsubishi , for example , have suffered little in the recent carnage . But investors are now dumping shares in any bank that has the remotest whiff of risk - particularly because the failure of Hokkaido Takushoku has made it clear that the finance ministry 's "" guarantee "" of the top 20 banks applies only to depositors and creditors , not to shareholders . 
 Even creditors are now none too sure about the worth of the ministry 's guarantee . This has pushed up the banks ' cost of borrowing . The "" Japan premium "" , the extra rate at which Japanese banks must borrow in dollars compared with their healthier foreign counterparts , has risen to between half and one percentage point this week . For Nippon Credit Bank , it reached four percentage points . Some weaker Japanese banks are finding it prohibitively expensive to borrow even in yen . Few , if any , foreign banks will give them credit lines , and healthy domestic banks are refusing to lend to their weaker brethren . Nobody wants to buy the debentures issued by any of the long - term credit banks . The weaker banks can get cash only from the Bank of Japan , which now has Y3.6 trillion in loans to the banking system compared with just 373 billion at the end of October . 
 Small wonder that shares in troubled banks have tumbled . Those in Yasuda Trust , which is part of the same keiretsu as Yamaichi , fell by 28 % on November 25th as its debt was downgraded to junk by Standard 8 Poor 's , a credit - rating agency . Shares in other big and deeply troubled banks such as Nippon Credit Bank , Long - Term Credit Bank and Daiwa Bank , fell as much . And they all fell further the next day . The market capitalisation of some of the weakest halved in two days . "" The markets are engineering the shutdown of banks . . . and that is very dangerous , "" says James Fiorillo , an analyst at ING Barings . 
 Mutual life insurers are in similarly dire straits . Not only are they the biggest holders of bank shares , but life insurers have given some Y434 billion in subordinated loans to brokers , and a whopping 14 trillion to banks . Subordinated loans are not covered by the finance ministry 's guarantee . Should more banks and brokers go bust , life insurers are unlikely to get this money back . 
 They are anyway in a pickle . Andrew Smithers , an independent London - based economist , reckons that , taken as a whole , the life - insurance industry is insolvent . Big companies , such as mighty Nippon Life , are reasonably robust . The smaller ones are anything but . One , Nissan Life , has already folded this year . Low interest rates , a mass cancellation of policies ( which eats into cashflow ) and a sinking stockmarket ( which eats into unrealised gains on their equity portfolios ) , already mean that they are suffering a severe shortage of available funds . Some insurers own large amounts of American Treasury bonds , and there are fears in America that they will dump these to raise cash . This seems unlikely : firms that hope to survive have no choice but to hold on to their Treasuries , their most highyielding assets at present . 
 The jitters of politicians and bureaucrats are understandable . For the first time since the beginning of 1996 , when the finance ministry pushed through a highly unpopular package to liquidate seven huge mortgage companies , there is talk of using public money to solve the financial crisis . Politicians feel that the public fright over financial failures will override objections to bailing out the banks . 
 The form that such public money would take is still undecided . One option is to set up a version of America 's Resolution Trust Corporation , which inherited and sold off the assets of failed savings and loan associations in the early 199os . A second option , increasingly favoured by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party , is to inject funds into the Deposit Insurance Corporation . Where it would get the money is unclear . One possible source is bonds guaranteed by the government . These would be bought by the finance ministry 's trust - fund bureau , which manages*400 trillion of deposits in the postal savings system . A seemingly more favoured option is to get money directly from the Bank of Japan . 
 How the money is injected is , in some ways , academic . The Deposit Insurance Corporation would not have the power to investigate banks and shut down those it deemed insolvent . It would only be able to dispose of banks ' assets once they had gone bust . This creates a problem more serious than the one it purports to solve . Without clarity as to whether bad institutions will be closed , the capital markets will force all but the strongest of banks to pay a huge premium to borrow money . That may drive even relatively healthy banks to the wall . In a sign of just such a development , shares in Fuji Bank - by no means the worst - ofi of Japan 's banking giants - did not trade for two days this week , so concerned has the market become about its health . 
 Worse , politicians , whatever their newfound commitment to using public cash , seem content to fiddle while Rome burns . The details of the Liberal Democratic Party 's scheme will not be announced until December ioth . Nothing is likely to become law until mid - January .

The prime minister had crushed the opposition in a general election, and was being applauded for his attempts to curtail the bureaucrats and slash government spending. Then he allowed himself to be arm-twisted by the party into appointing Koko Sato, a convicted bribe-taker, to his cabinet. Ever since, Mr Hashimoto has been on the defensive. 
Before the present session of the Diet (parliament) ends on December 12th, Mr Hashimoto will come under enormous pressure to compile a pork-laden supplementary budget for the LDP'S special friends in the building industry and down on the farm. This is the kind of wasteful spending that Mr Hashimoto's fiscal reform bill, passed on November 28th, was supposed to stop. Thanks to a decade of splurging on needless public works, the government's accumulated debt-some Y475 trillion ($3.7 trillion) or 95% of GDP is now one of the highest among industrial countries. The reform bill aims to reduce Japan's budget deficit from 7% of GDP today to less than 3% by 2003. The bill also requires the government to stop issuing deficit-covering bonds within five years-and to start by cutting public-works spending by 7% next year. 
To add to his woes, the prime minister's plans for administrative reform have been mutilated. Mr Hashimoto's biggest climbdown has been over post-office privatisation. No one seriously expected mail delivery to be turned over to the private sector. But privatising the postal savings and insurance business was seen as the best way to wrestle these vast funds away from the finance ministry's Trust Fund Bureau. The ministry has used this money to finance two ""off-budget budgets"" for its own purposes. Between them, the fiscal investment and loan programme and the 30-odd special budgets for specific undertakings (eg, road building) add up to more than the national budget. Much of the money goes into maintaining some 90 public corporations whose main function these days is to provide cushy retirement jobs for officials. 
With the present turmoil in Japan's financial industry, the LDP has started demanding that public money be used to halt the rot that has caused four big banks or securities firms to collapse over the past month. Only a few weeks ago Mr Hashimoto said that no public money would be used to deal with a financial crisis brought on by reckless lending and shoddy management. He has now had to make a u-turn (see page 81). He will soon have to make another on fiscal reform. The supplementary budget being thrust on him by his party may inject Y5 trillion into the economy through tax breaks for small businesses and farmers and yet more spending on disaster protection and public works. 
The party's criticism of Mr Hashimoto has turned personal. A parliamentary committee has questioned him about his relationship some years ago with a female Chinese government official who is now thought to have been a spy. Clearly, moves are afoot to put an end to the prime minister's second term of office. 
The plotters in the LDP do not yet have a suitable replacement as party leader. Mr Hashimoto will carry on for now as the prime minister more by default than design. But it is just possible, too, that he could surprise everyone by making a stand over his reforms. The fickle public would be applauding him again-and the party would then have to back him too.

Even if they had not, a stalled economy, a spate of bankruptcies at banks and brokers, and the spread of banking crises and stockmarket collapses across East Asia might have galvanised Japan's leaders into action. 
If only. Politicians do, at long last, recognise the need for public money to solve the financial system's woes. Also, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has set up a committee chaired by Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister and a political heavyweight, to study how that public cash should best be used. But that is as far as the reaction goes. Japan's politicians now recognise that they need to do something about the problem. But resolving it is still not a matter of urgency. This displays timidity and stupidity in equal measure. The politicians are loth to offend Mrs Watanabe, the archetypal Japanese housewife who controls the family's purse-strings. She was outraged last year, when the government pushed through a bill to liquidate seven mortgage companies, known as jusen, with 685 billion ($6.3 billion at the time) of tax money. The government of Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, is now at pains to persuade her that insolvent banks, brokers and insurance companies must be bailed out But honest estimates of the cost start at io trillion-nearly $80 billion-and run to Y30 trillion or more. Someone has to tell Mrs Watanabe that she faces a whopping bill, but no one wants to face her ire. Better, then, not to get into the painful details 
Japanese politicians have a good template to study: the resolution of America's savings-and-loan (s&L) debacle at the beginning of the decade. The s&L crisis was tiddly compared with the one facing Japan. But they share some similarities. For one, the regulator for American housing lenders, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, was widely felt to be part of the problem, much as Japan's finance ministry now bears the onus for the collapse of institutions that it regulates. For another, America's regulator, like Japan's, was geared more to revising s&Ls' accounts than to dealing with the assets owned by insolvent institutions. These simply piled up, just as troubled Japanese institutions today sit with their balance sheets brimming with dubious assets. In America, two important steps turned the situation around. The first was restor ing credibility. A different agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in effect took charge of finding out which thrifts were solvent and which were not. In 1989, it shut down 262 institutions in little more than six months; by 1993 it had closed 747. Depositors, creditors and investors were left in no doubt what would happen if an s&L ran low on capital. The other main reason for America's success was the creation of the Resolution Trust Corporation, also in 1989. Resolution Trust's job was to take over failed institutions' finances, pay off depositors immediately and sell the assets as quickly as possible. It was given a tight time-frame and freedom from normal bureaucratic constraints; its staff even received bigger bonuses for selling assets quickly. This was made easier because they held property from many S&Ls, allowing them to pull together, say, shopping centres from several different portfolios and sell them in bulk to a single investor. Between them, a tougher regulator and an efficient asset-sales agency quickly brought the problem under control. As a result, the final cost to American taxpayers, about $91 billion, was far less than many original estimates. 
Japanese politicians seem not to have studied this example. They still see opacity as a virtue not a vice. One of their proposals would ""save"" the banking system by injecting equity into weaker banks. This would allow the government to portray its action as an investment rather than a bailout. Never mind that propping up duff banks by injecting fresh capital would prolong the industry's overcapacity and thus hurt Japan's healthier banks, as well as leaving the ""rescued"" institutions stuffed with dubious assets that had yet to be written down to their true market value. This would not bolster confidence in the banking system. 
A second plan has more echoes of the American solution. This is to expand the role of Japan's Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC). It would be able to borrow money, with a government guarantee, either from the Bank of Japan or from the finance ministry's trust-fund bureau, which manages postal-savings money. Any shortfall would be made up out of the government's budget in 2001. 
In fact, this provides only a quarter of a solution. It postpones (again deliberately) the issue of using taxpayers' cash directly. And it would do nothing to restore public confidence, since the DIC would act only as a receptacle for banks that regulators declared to be bad. It would not clear up doubts about which banks were dodgy in the first place. Moreover, nothing has been said about whether the DIC would be able to seize banks' assets; or how they would be sold; or if there would be a ceiling on the amount of the liabilities that the DlC could absorb. Nobody is prepared to come out with numbers. 
The worst of it all is this: politicians do not seem to have realised that neither depositors nor the capital markets will believe in a solution overseen by the finance ministry. Its bureaucrats have spent much of the past decade concocting preposterous lies about the health of the finance industry. In mid-1995, the then finance minister, Masayoshi Takemura, said, after the closure of Hyogo Bank, that no other big banks would go bust Even last week the present finance minister claimed that Yamaichi, the country's fourth-largest stockbroker, was still solvent, even though the firm has said it will close. 
Betsy Daniels, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, argues that the clean-up job should be given to the Bank of Japan, whIch, unlike the finance ministry, still has some degree of credibility. That, coupled with a vIc empowered to seize and sell assets, may well be the best solution-and, despite its up front costs, in the long run it would probably be the cheapest.

His feelings are understandable Mr Royama, a professor at Osaka University, is also an adviser to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's Financial System Stabilisation Panel, which is supposed to be finding ways to restore health to Japan's rapidly failing financial system. A sub-committee of this panel was supposed to come out with proposals on December loth. It was then due to present these proposals to the LDP two days later, so that the party could include them in a package of measures to be announced on December i6th. It didn't. The sub-committee's meeting was delayed by a day. It is now unclear whether the rest of the timetable will be kept. 
The meeting was postponed ostensibly because Japan's opposition parties had proposed a no-confidence vote in the coalition government, which is dominated by the LDP, for the following day, the last of this year's Diet (parliament* In reality it was shifted because many of the committee's members were cross that Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's beleaguered prime minister, had ignored the committee and lent his support to a proposal from Seiroku Kajiyama, a former chief cabinet secretary. 
This proposal comes in two parts. The first involves the package's financing. Mr Hashimoto is committed to reducing public debt. Only two weeks ago, the Diet passed a law committing the government to reduce the government's budget deficit to 3% of GDP and eliminate the issuing of deficit-financing bonds by 2003. Issuing lots of government bonds now to pump money into the financial system would have gone against the spirit if not the letter of the law. 
Step forward Mr Kajiyama. He proposed a way for the government to raise io trillion-worth ($78 billion) of bonds without, miraculously, seeming to increase the general government debt. This was to use the government's remaining shares in Nrr, Japan Tobacco and other companies as collateral for the bonds. Backed by collateral, such borrowing would not show up in the general government borrowing figures. But in many ways the proposal is a deceit, for the net indebtedness of the government still rises. ""It is only a policy for accountants,"" fumes Mr Royama. 
The second point of the proposal-what Mr Kajiyama wants done with the money is just as controversial. Like much else in the debate about how to use public funds, this is murky. For one thing, it was not clear that all of the money would be spent on propping up banks and other financial firms; though later in the week Mr Hashimoto was claiming that it would be spent only on doing something about Japan's financial system. 
Mr Kajiyama seemingly wants to inject public money into moribund financial institutions. This would be lunacy. There is certainly a good argument for injecting public money into.healthy banks that take over the sound assets of failed institutions. However, to inject it into unsound ones rewards the weak, penalises the strong and creates a huge moral hazard. Moreover, such a policy would do nothing to restore the confidence of either depositors or the capital markets, for both would be rightfully wary of any bank that felt the need for an infusion of capital. And it would do nothing at all about the banks' bad debts. 
Just as bad is the fact that Mr Kaj iyama's entry into the debate has created unnecessary delay and confusion. His proposals for raising money will probably be adopted even if his ideas for spending it are not: the wheeze allows the prime minister to save face. But no details have been thrashed out and time is running out fast Mr Royama and others are likely to find the coming week a very fretful one indeed.

The sub - committee 's meeting was delayed by a day . It is now unclear whether the rest of the timetable will be kept . 
 The meeting was postponed ostensibly because Japan 's opposition parties had proposed a no - confidence vote in the coalition government , which is dominated by the LDP , for the following day , the last of this year 's Diet ( parliament * In reality it was shifted because many of the committee 's members were cross that Ryutaro Hashimoto's , had ignored the committee and lent Ryutaro Hashimoto's support to a proposal from Seiroku Kajiyama , a former chief cabinet secretary . 
 This proposal comes in two parts . The first involves the package 's financing . Ryutaro Hashimoto is committed to reducing public debt . Only two weeks ago , the Diet passed a law committing the government to reduce the government 's budget deficit to 3 % of GDP and eliminate the issuing of deficit - financing bonds by 2003 . Issuing lots of government bonds now to pump money into the financial system would have gone against the spirit if not the letter of the law . 
 Step forward Mr Kajiyama . He proposed a way for the government to raise io trillion - worth ( $ 78 billion ) of bonds without , miraculously , seeming to increase the general government debt . This was to use the government 's remaining shares in Nrr , Japan Tobacco and other companies as collateral for the bonds . Backed by collateral , such borrowing would not show up in the general government borrowing figures . But in many ways the proposal is a deceit , for the net indebtedness of the government still rises . "" It is only a policy for accountants , "" fumes Mr Royama . 
 The second point of the proposal - what Mr Kajiyama wants done with the money is just as controversial . Like much else in the debate about how to use public funds , this is murky . For one thing , it was not clear that all of the money would be spent on propping up banks and other financial firms ; though later in the week Ryutaro Hashimoto was claiming that it would be spent only on doing something about Japan 's financial system . 
 Mr Kajiyama seemingly wants to inject public money into moribund financial institutions . This would be lunacy . There is certainly a good argument for injecting public money into.healthy banks that take over the sound assets of failed institutions . However , to inject it into unsound ones rewards the weak , penalises the strong and creates a huge moral hazard . Moreover , such a policy would do nothing to restore the confidence of either depositors or the capital markets , for both would be rightfully wary of any bank that felt the need for an infusion of capital . And it would do nothing at all about the banks ' bad debts . 
 Just as bad is the fact that Mr Kaj iyama 's entry into the debate has created unnecessary delay and confusion . His proposals for raising money will probably be adopted even if his ideas for spending it are not : the wheeze allows the prime minister to save face . But no details have been thrashed out and time is running out fast Mr Royama and others are likely to find the coming week a very fretful one indeed .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,"Ryutaro Hashimoto , Japan 's beleaguered prime minister",4,True
1997-12-20,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224079270/fulltext/F1F6FF62903B4555PQ/4?accountid=14657,"AS 1997 draws towards a close, it is safe to say that the most important phenomenon ofthe year has been the financial turmoil in Asia. Some might cite instead Binyamin Netanyahu, Saddam Hussein, Deng Xiaoping, the Princess of Wales, Tony Blair, Dolly the sheep, even the Spice Girls: but in truth it is Asia's condition that has raised the most important questions, and could have the most far-reaching consequences. Is the turmoil a local issue or might it harm the rest of the world? Does it signify the failure of a particular economic or political ideology, which might thus hold lessons for others?And, most pressing of all: is the turmoil over? 
It is best to start by combining the last and the first of those questions. When economic slowdowns, plunging currencies, collapsing banks and struggling companies were confined to Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, the story could be considered as being principally of local importance. These economies are small, and their trading and investment links to the rest of the world are modest. But when the story moved north-eastwards to South Korea and Japan it took on a new seriousness. These are two of the world's largest economies which, contrary to popular perception, are also two of the world's largest importers as well as sending their investments all over the globe. A financial calamity there could bring on a worldwide slowdown or even slump. 
So is one likely? The answer, alas, is that such a calamity can still not be ruled out. In Korea, this is principally because shoring up the country's banks requires the right government policies, which in turn requires a government-and the country was voting on December 18th for a new president, whose government will not formally take office until February 25th. In Japan, however, the uncertainty is not the result simply of circumstance. Faced with a renewed slump in confidence among consumers, investors and depositors, and the likelihood of a spate of collapses among the country's biggest banks, the government needed to act clearly and decisively. A big tax cut was required to stimulate the economy; and a huge, preferably open-ended, amount of public money had to be made available to keep banks afloat while they are merged, sold, closed or otherwise revamped. Yet the Japanese government's response has been neither clear nor decisive. 
On December 17th Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, did announce a YZ trillion ($i6 billion) cut in income taxes, plus an Y 850 billion cut in corporate taxes. But this will apply only for one year, and merely reverses the fiscal tightening his government enforced last spring. News has also emerged of a plan to issue io trillion-worth of government bonds to finance bank rescues. Yet the plan is vague, with no details of how the rescues will work nor whether more money will be made available if it turns out to be needed (see page 47). Mr Hashimoto says his aim is to stop the economic troubles ""originating in Japan from causing global depression"". That is a fine aim, and his plan was a step in the right direction. But the risk remains of a Japanese collapse, which worsens the broader Asian collapse, and then causes a worldwide recession. 
No model, but a broader moral That brings on the wider questions. How could this have happened, in a region where growth was proceeding swimmingly, where the ""fundamentals"" of high savings, topnotch education and technology, and social peace seem still to apply? Has the ""Asian model"" gone wrong? 
At a time of financial collapse, the ""fundamentals"" are virtually irrelevant. In 1930, America's fundamentals were strong, and barely a decade ahead lay the country's greatest military triumph and its emergence as an economic, political and technological superpower. Nevertheless, it was about to enter the Great Depression. That is what big financial collapses can produce, when combined with disastrous macroeconomic policies-in America's case, sharp monetary tightening, plus fierce protectionism. 
That, in all its simplicity, is the only general lesson that can be brought to bear on Asia's troubles. The economies in difficulty do not share anything that can be sensibly described as an ""Asian model"", still less an ideology. Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea have as much, or as little, in common as do France, Britain and Italy, say: although, like all capitalist economies, they choose from the same tray of ingredients, their mixtures of policies and structures have been different. They have not, contrary to many pundits' claims, shared a common desire to have the state directing economic progress and private investment. Compare these economies with India's, say, and you will see that what stands out is their willingness to use relatively open markets rather than state direction to generate growth; compare them with each other, and what stands out is a wide difference in the state's role, as wide as that between France, Britain and Italy. 
Like those European economies, though, what they do share is a region, and close economic links. In the good years, the Asians' increasing exchange of trade and investment with each other, and even their tourists' desire to lie on each others' beaches, helped make their growth mutually reinforcing. Now that a bad year has arrived, this effect has gone into reverse. And it is being exacerbated by three characteristics that are widespread, though not ideological: first, that fast growth had concealed, or even encouraged, the existence of many poorly run and poorly regulated banks; second, that some Asian governments have been slow to accept that tough remedies were needed to avert banking collapses, instead preferring, like Malaysia, to blame outsiders; and, that in several East Asian countries worries about political instability threaten to make economic uncertainties even worse. 
This third worry applies particularly to South Korea and Indonesia (see page 49). But it could also apply to China, whose economy has so far been relatively unscathed but which next year faces the task of privatising its vast state enterprises. That hard task will be made even harder by Asia's weakening economy. The risk is that the associated pains could break apart the collective leadership that has run China since the death of Deng, in February, raising the prospect of some possible goods, but also plenty of possible bads. 
That, as with so much else at a time of financial turmoil, is mere speculation. All that can be said for sure about Asia's troubles is that they are serious, and that the risk of them spreading to the rest of the world is also serious. Whether locally or globally, however, the basic lesson remains that of America in 193o. Deflations and depressions are avoidable. Financial collapses make them possible, because they destroy the confidence on which economic activity depends. But what makes them happen is policy mistakes: closing your economy, blocking capital flows, ignoring banking collapses, blaming foreigners, choking off the money supply. Let governments dwell upon that, over the holidays. ","AS 1997 draws towards a close , it is safe to say that the most important phenomenon ofthe year has been the financial turmoil in Asia .

In three articles, we look at Japan's attempt to revive its own economy, the hopes it has dashed among its neighbours, and the collapse of the main opposition party at home 
TODAY we solved the Japan prob lem,"" said a confident Eisuke Sakakibara, the voluble big cheese at japan's finance ministry. He was describing on December 17th the third economic package to be announced in as many months by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which dominates the coalition government. Though that package was far from empty, Japan has still not got to grips with its own financial mess. That risks aggravating the one that is still sweeping through South-East Asia and neighbouring South Korea. 
Unlike the LDP'S previous two packages, this one has something substantial in it. It includes at least io trillion ($76 billion) to -help sort out Japan's financial system. This infusion of money marks a sudden U-turn by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister. There are also biggerthan-expected tax cuts, in particular, a cut in income tax of some Y 2 trillion. When the tax cuts are added to extra spending on public works, it is worth almost 5 trillion, about 1% of GDP, said Mr Sakakibara. 
All this suggests that the LDP is develop ing a sense of urgency. The need for the region's biggest economy to be strong enough, not only to deal with its own problems but also to help with its neighbours, has been impressed on Mr Hashimoto, by America especially and, most recently, at the meeting of East Asian leaders that began in Kuala Lumpur on December 14th. Many of those Asian leaders fear that, if Japan bungles its own affairs, not only could that destroy the prospects for any regional recovery but it might spread financial mayhem much farther afield. 
Japan's economy, the world's second biggest, is almost twice as large as all the economies of the rest of Asia. Fears that the Japanese might resort to a tit-for-tat devaluation of the yen to boost exports have contributed to currency devaluations elsewhere. Japan's central bank has, however, recently intervened to support the yen. There are fears too that Japanese banks, by far the biggest lenders in the region, might call in their loans. 
So markets all over Asia breathed a sigh of relief when the LDP announced its package. The yen, which had plunged to Y131.7 against the dollar, its lowest level in five years, climbed by almost six yen. Japan's financial markets need all the good news they can get. Though the economy grew by 3.5% last year, it has more recently shown dangerous signs of shrinking-especially after the government decided in April to rein in spending and increase taxes. Business confidence has slumped, and even the normally optimistic Economic Planning Agency has deleted the word ""recovery"" from its assessments. 
In addition to the fall-out from the financial crisis elsewhere in Asia, the Japanese economy has two homegrown problems. One is that large parts of its financial system are insolvent. Banks are riddled with bad loans from a collapse in asset prices. The finance ministry now admits that banks' bad loans do not amount to Y27 trillion, as it had previously claimed, but, on a ""broader"" (ie, more accurate) definition, Y 79 trillion. Many of Japan's life-insurance companies are also in dreadful shape. A number of Japanese financial firms have already gone bust. 
The second problem is that the government has been determined to get its own debts under control by raising taxes and social-security contributions, which the economy manifestly cannot at present afford. The new package starts to tackle both these problems. Yet plenty of worries remain. Though the package is long on promise, it is short on detail. The Vio trillion of public money that it is making available will probably be injected into the Deposit Insurance Corporation, but exactly what use will be made of it there remains unclear. It could be spent on bailing out banks or depositors, or both. ""It's really confusing,"" admits a senior official at the Bank of Japan. 
Under the mattress 
The tax cuts do not amount to much. They will last no more than oneyear. Yet only if the Japanese have to pay less tax for longer are they likely to save less and spend more, which would help boost the economy. And as they have yet to be persuaded of the soundness of their financial institutions, many Japanese are likely to remain cross about the use of public money to nurse these crocks back to health. They are equally likely to stuff their tax savings under the mattress. 
Therein lies the problem. On the one hand, the Japanese government has been loth to tell its taxpayers that their money will be used to bail out the ailing financial system. But on the other, it is trying to convince the world's financial markets that public money will be used where necessary. This can be done wisely-by, for instance, helping healthy financial firms to take over sound assets from firms that have failed. But so far it is impossible to say with confidence that the rescue is truly judicious: too little information has been given. Only when politicians realise that leadership and openness are a virtue in a crisis will Japan's ""problem"" be solved.

IT WAS supposed to be a celebration, but, like a wedding at which the bride has failed to turn up, it seemed more like a funeral. When the invitations were issued for a summit of East Asian leaders, the event promised to be a gathering of economic miracle-workers flaunting their trophies. 
By the time the meeting in Kuala Lumpur started on December 14th, many were helpless spectators to a mauling of their currencies, stockmarkets and economies in general by forces they barely comprehended. They came not to praise a miracle, but to bury it. 
Not long ago there seemed so much to celebrate. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (AsEAN), which organised the event, turned 30 this year. During its lifetime, many of its members have raced out of poverty to relative prosperity, partly thanks to the regional political stability the group has helped to secure. The summit, to which the leaders of China, Japan and South Korea were also invited, was supposed to demonstrate a new maturity and equality in dealing with the regional giants, while at the same time showing independence from the United States. 
But the leaders of two countries had to send substitutes. In power ever since ASEAN was founded, President Suharto of Indonesia stayed home to nurse a mysterious ailment, while reports of his illness drove his country's stockmarket and currency ever lower (see box on next page). South Korea's president, Kim Young Sam, also remained at home while an election was held to pick his successor. The victor faces a daunting battle to reform what was the world's 11th largest economy, but which may now be unable to repay its foreign loans. He will also have to reach some sort of power-sharing agreement with Mr Kim, who does not officially step down until February 25th. 
Far from sketching out a dream of shared future prosperity, the summit was preoccupied with ending the nightmare. As Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy prime minister, put it, the general fear was that ""the ongoing liquidity crunch"" might before too long turn into ""a total meltdown"". 
If the summit were to come up with solutions, the region's two biggest economies Japan and China-had to help. They did not. The best that Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, could do was to promise that there would not be ""a world panic sparked by Japan"". 
Others were not so sure. Mr Hashimoto outlined a few measures to alleviate regional distress-cheaper soft loans for infrastructure projects, a big export-credit insurance facility, and training in Japan for 20,ooo South-East Asians. But this was hardly the decisive intervention some had hoped for. Nor could Mr Hashimoto promise that Japan's banks would not call in their loans to companies in the afflicted countries, perhaps precipitating national bankruptcies. Rather, he stressed the importance of the IMF in leading international rescue attempts. 
Nor did China show any inclination to take a lead. Its president, Jiang Zemin, did reassure the meeting that China had no plans to devalue its currency, the yuan. That will be a relief to South-East Asian exporters, who have come to fear that the cycle of competitive devaluations might never end. But China will set the value of the yuan according to its own economic needs rather than neighbourly generosity. Mr Jiang also said he would urge Chinese companies to invest in South-East Asia. ASEAN leaders, some of whose countries have invested heavily in China, must have cringed at this reversal of roles. 
Unable to tackle the crisis themselves, the summiteers instead praised piecemeal self-help remedies: increasing trade within the region, trying to get currencies away from their dependence on the dollar, and reaffirming a ""framework"" agreed on in Manila in November for future bailouts. This concedes the In.tFs primacy, but promises enhanced ""peer pressure"" through greater mutual surveillance. 
None of this has much relevance to the immediate crisis. As far as that was concerned, the leaders argued that more help was needed from the West. Japan seemed reluctant to be cast as the go-between, but was encouraged to persuade America and Europe that they needed to do more. Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister of international trade, likened the IMF to a doctor who treats tuberculosis with cough drops. With more than $100 billion committed in the IMF-arranged rescues of Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, that may seem an expensive lozenge. But Miss Rafidah is right that ""the cough is getting worse"". ","BANGKOK AND KUALA LUMPUR

Rather , Ryutaro Hashimoto stressed the importance of the IMF in leading international rescue attempts . 
 Nor did China show any inclination to take a lead . Its president , Jiang Zemin , did reassure the meeting that China had no plans to devalue its currency , the yuan . That will be a relief to South - East Asian exporters , who have come to fear that the cycle of competitive devaluations might never end . But China will set the value of the yuan according to its own economic needs rather than neighbourly generosity . Mr Jiang also said he would urge Chinese companies to invest in South - East Asia . ASEAN leaders , some of whose countries have invested heavily in China , must have cringed at this reversal of roles . 
 Unable to tackle the crisis themselves , the summiteers instead praised piecemeal self - help remedies : increasing trade within the region , trying to get currencies away from their dependence on the dollar , and reaffirming a "" framework "" agreed on in Manila in November for future bailouts . This concedes the In.tFs primacy , but promises enhanced "" peer pressure "" through greater mutual surveillance . 
 None of this has much relevance to the immediate crisis . As far as that was concerned , the leaders argued that more help was needed from the West . Japan seemed reluctant to be cast as the go - between , but was encouraged to persuade America and Europe that they needed to do more . Rafidah Aziz , Malaysia 's minister of international trade , likened the IMF to a doctor who treats tuberculosis with cough drops . With more than $ 100 billion committed in the IMF - arranged rescues of Thailand , Indonesia and South Korea , that may seem an expensive lozenge . But Miss Rafidah is right that "" the cough is getting worse "" .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,"Japan 's prime minister , Ryutaro Hashimoto ,",4,True

In late December, the citizens of Nago, a town in Okinawa's impoverished rural north, voted by 54% to 46% not to let the American Marine Corps moor a floating helicopter base off the beach, near its existing Camp Schwab. The result of the non-binding referendum, while gloomily predicted, has plunged Ryutaro Hashimoto's government into further confusion. 
The idea behind the heliport is that it will take over the functions of the marines' Futenma air base at Ginowan, in the prosperous southern half of the main island. The Americans will then hand back the land. Okinawa's governor, Masahide Ota, has been badgered by developers who drool over Futenma's open spaces close to the crowded prefectural capital, Naha. Mr Ota can say goodbye to a third term if the marines fail to leave. 
One of the points of an agreement struck by President Clinton and Mr Hashimoto during their meeting in April 1996 was the return of Futenma in five to seven yearsprovided an alternative site could be found for the air base. But the noisy and occasionally violent young marines would be no more popular in any other prefecture than they are in Nago. Mr Ota is having to walk a tightrope between, on the one hand, trying to find an acceptable site for the heliport so as to keep the generous subsidies flowing from Tokyo while, on the other hand, pandering to local residents in order to get re-elected. 
Okinawa would be much poorer without the American bases. The bases themselves contribute only 5% to the local economy (down from 27% in 1972). But compensation from Tokyo for putting up with the Americans adds substantially to that. Even though the people of Nago voted against the helicopter base, most Okinawans fear that, were the Americans to go, so would the handouts. Okinawans have become dependent on these, relying on central government for two-thirds of the prefectural government's income-some Y430 billion ($3.3 billion) a year. 
The bribes now dangled before Nago's residents include an immediate Y2 billion in central-government grants, with promises of a further Y100 billion in public works. This has been more than enough to persuade Nago's mayor, Tetsuya Higa, that the floating heliport would do much to revitalise the local economy.

Merrill Lynch's announcement on December 25th that it would hire some 2,000 of the 7,500 employees of failed Yamaichi Securities, and acquire up to 50 branch offices, shows just how serious the Japanese government is about its wideranging ""big bang"" financial reforms. 
A year ago, such an acquisition by a foreign broker would have been impossible. And yet Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, publicly welcomed Merrill Lynch's action and even urged the American securities firm to expand further in Japan. This, he said, would ""help revive confidence in the Japanese financial market."" 
That is only one of the benefits. After decades of discouraging foreign financial institutions, Japan urgently needs them to help clean up insolvent banks and insurance companies. Foreign cash and knowhow have been essential in helping Japanese institutions shed their problem loans. Goldman Sachs, another American investment bank, recently bought Y12.5 billion ($100m) of bad property loans from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, and Merrill, Morgan Stanley and other foreign banks have set up property arms to package and resell problem loans bought from troubled banks. 
The foreigners are not just vultures flocking to the fire for a quick feast. Merrill Lynch's move into retail broking suggests that foreign firms are now prepared to do the donkey work needed to establish a long-term business in Japan. Merrill tried before in the late 1980s, opening half a dozen retail branches. The venture proved grossly unprofitable and was closed in 1993. Since then, the firm's Japan business has focused on institutional clients, such as pension funds. Its aggression has paid off: with all four of Japan's big brokerage houses enveloped in scandals over payoffs to extortionists, Merrill has become the biggest trader on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
The coming deregulation of investment trusts (mutual funds) has stimulated Merrill's retail ambitions. The financial assets owned by Japanese households amount to a staggering Y1,220 trillion, only 3% of which are held in investment trusts. But when the law is changed this summer to allow banks and brokers to sell investment trusts, managing people's assets promises to be a hugely profitable business. If the Japanese start snapping up investment trusts as eagerly as America's aging baby boomers moved into mutual funds, an additional Y80 trillion worth of funds could be sold by banks and brokers in Japan over the next few years. 
Before Yamaichi went bust in November, Merrill was talking to Sanwa Bank about jointly buying Yamaichi's languishing investment-trust business. Using its own product-development skills, Yamaichi's customer base and Sanwa's 400 branches, Merrill hoped for a fast start in fund management. That deal may still go through. But the opportunity to build a full retail-broking business in Japan from the ashes of Yamaichi clearly excites Merrill more. The problem is how to acquire the bits it needs without taking on the bankrupt firm's liabilities. Merrill is betting that the offer of a couple of thousand jobs will help it drive a hard bargain.

A powerful ruling party and a fragmented opposition are neither desirable nor particularly stable. Until a couple of weeks ago, Ichiro Ozawa's New Frontier Party was the leading opposition force. But on December 27th he disbanded the party founded only three years ago, with the idea of purging a handful of dissenters who had dared to challenge his leadership. In this, the autocratic Mr Ozawa miscalculated. Previously, he controlled 173 members in the two houses ofthe Diet (parliament); now he presides over a ragtag group-renamed the Liberal Party-of only 54. 
The rest of Mr Ozawa's former followers, weary of having their party treated as their leader's plaything, have gone their merry ways, most of them pausing for the time being in a handful of minor opposition parties. With the Diet reconvening on January 12th, new opposition groupings are taking shape. 
The immediate beneficiary of Mr Ozawa's mistake is the fledgling Democratic Party, which has been devastatingly successful at the polls since it was founded little more than a year ago. Its populist leader, Naoto Kan, has been holding talks with some of Mr Ozawa's former supporters to create an alliance that can challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
Before they throw in their lot with Mr Kan, these potential allies are trying to hammer out a common agenda (something that Mr Ozawa did not do when he merged nine political groups to form the New Frontier Party. So far, they have agreed on eight policy issues, including a 6 trillion ($45 billion) tax cut (compared with the LDP'S proposed Y2 trillion cut) to help revive Japan's sickly economy. The potential allies are against using public money to bail out troubled banks: the depositors should be protected but the banks allowed to go bust. And they are gunning for Taku Yamasaki, the LDP'S chief policymaker. They aim to get Mr Yamasaki to answer questions in the Diet under oath on claims that an Osaka-based oil dealer paid large sums of money to LDP officials. 
The alliance has had trouble picking a leader. On January 8th, Megumu Sato, a former justice minister, emerged as the most likely front-runner.The left-leaning Mr Kan would not be attractive as a leader to many of the conservative-minded groups to which he has been talking. But even if the alliance turns out to be more a loose federation than a single party, it will still be able to field some 97 members in the lower house and 44 in the upper house, a formidable force. 
How does the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, view the downfall of Mr Ozawa? Obviously, with some relief. With Japan's economy in trouble, it was beginning to look as though Mr Hashimoto would be forced to resign. Few were expecting him to stay in office much beyond April, let alone lead the LDP into an upper-house election in July. But 44 members of the Diet who had previously defected from the LDP to Mr Ozawa have now returned to the mother party. More could follow as divisions within Mr Ozawa's new Liberal Party emerge. Meanwhile, a new grouping called the Peace Reform Party, with 46 members in the lower house, has also been formed out of the ashes of Mr Ozawa's party. It is supported mainly by the Soka Gakkai, a rich Buddhist organisation that was Mr Ozawa's principal backer. The new group is expected to combine with the Soka Gakkaiaffiliated politicians in the upper houseto rebuild what is in effect the old Komeito (Clean Government Party) The born-again Komeito is expected to support the Liberal Democratic Party. 
All this makes Mr Hashimoto no longer dependent for survival on two minor opposition parties, the Social Democrats and the Sakigake. Mr Hashimoto has had to stand helplessly by as a central policy proposal-slimming down the country's bureaucracy-has been gutted by Social Democrats worried about civil servants losing their jobs. And the diminutive Sakigake has dug its heels in over how the recalcitrant finance ministry should be reformed. The Sakigake is insisting that the ministry's fiscal and financial powers be separated. Whatever the merits of separation, the LDP has decided that it cannot afford to fight of ficials who compile the budget, especially not this year. 
Suddenly, therefore, the prospects look better for Mr Hashimoto's intended reforms. There is even talk that he might call a snap general election for July, to coincide with the upper-house election. If successful, Mr Hashimoto could remain prime minister until October 1999. Meanwhile, an unrepentant Mr Ozawa still has visions of the LDP disintegrating-with the ruling party's conservatives calling him, Churchill-like, from the wilderness to lead it in its time of need.

SLOWLY, ever so slowly, Japan's politicians have come to acknowledge that they have a problem on their hands. A decade after they came to inspire awe as the world's largest and richest institutions,Japan's banks are in desperate straits. If they honestly admitted the market value ofthe loans, shares and property they hold, many would be insolvent. The size of the hole staggers the imagination. The latest official figure for the banking system's bad loans, 77 trillion ($600 billion), may still be an underestimate, and the gap in life-insurance companies' accounts may be 6o trillion more. 
This disaster did not arise overnight, but it has taken the Japanese government too many years to acknowledge its seriousness. The reason, of course, is that admitting a big problem necessitates a search for a big solution, and any big solution will have unpleasant political consequences. Only now, their hand forced by the failure of two big investment banks in November and by the increasing reluctance of the credit markets to lend money to Japanese banks, are the politicians seriously pondering a way out. The government says it is ready to spend 30 trillion, or approaching $250 billion, to restore the banking system to health. 
The banking crisis in Japan, far more than the economic collapses in South Korea and South-East Asia, represents a serious threat to the world. It is badly retarding Japan's own growth. It hinders Japan's ability to buy the exports that other Asian countries must pump out to recover from their own crises. And because no important financial institution elsewhere can avoid dealing with banks the size ofthose in Japan, Japan's weak banks inevitably put the stability of the world financial system at risk. That the government is at least prepared to spend a quarter of a trillion dollars is a good sign. But why spend so much money without fixing the problem? At present, the cures it is considering make leeches look good. 
First, face the truth 
As always in Japan, details about the government's intentions are scarce. But the ideas that have leaked into the Japanese press suggest that the government intends to obtain funds mainly by borrowing from the state-run postal savings system, and to use them in two different ways. About '7 trillion would go, in some way or other, to pay off depositors in failed banks. The remainder, about 13 trillion, would buy preferred stock and subordinated debt in individual banks. This injection of capital would bolster the banks so that they can lend again, addressing the purported credit crunch on which many Japanese now blame a sluggish economy (see page 70). 
While paying off depositors is unavoidable-the Japanese government has long promised its citizens that all of their bank deposits are insured-recapitalising the banks in this way is precisely the wrong remedy for Japan's ills. It would not force the banks to write off and sell assets that have lost value. Portfolios would still be chock-a-block with loans that yield no interest and shares that cannot be sold because their sale would force banks to book a loss. This would leave investors, depositors and foreign banks with only the most opaque view of any institution's true health-no minor issue given that, for all of their troubles, 127 out of 146 banks contrived to avoid reporting net losses in the most recent fiscal year. 
Recapitalisation will also interfere with the long-overdue shrinkage of the financial system. Japan lags well behind America and Europe in restructuring its banking sector. Despite miserable performance-from 1987 through 1996, while America's biggest banks earned an average 8.4% return on equity, Japan's earned an average of 1.8%-only a handful of banks have merged or gone out of business. The survival of so many, thanks lately to generous loans from the Bank of Japan, has made it hard for the better ones to earn a decent profit. The onset of financial deregulation will only add to these competitive pressures. The government needs to allow weak institutions to fail rather than helping them limp along. Only if a good bank takes over the assets of a failed one should it be entitled to a shot of public money. 
But what about lending? The call to recapitalise banks so that they can lend more shows that many in Japan still misunderstand the cause of the crisis. Japan's banks as a group suffer from too much capital, not too little. Trying to earn a return on this capital is why the banks have lent so freely, driving the prices of shares, property and golf-club memberships to ridiculous heights. Now, with the economy in the dumps, bankers rightly see that borrowers' risks are great and, in the near term, their profit opportunities small. They should be praised for scrutinising creditworthiness at long last, not pilloried for being tight-fisted. 
Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, deserves credit for, however belatedly, putting the ills of his country's financial system on view. Curing them, however, requires steps that Japanese politicians still will not discuss in public: shutting sick institutions, laying their workers off, and wiping out their shareholders. Rather than topping up the banks' capital, the government should use its money to pay off insured depositors as their banks are closed. In return, it should take over failed banks' assets and sell them off-for cash only-to recoup some of its costs. And if foreigners should want to buy the assets, or the remains of the failed banks, the government should be only too willing to take their money.

 Ryutaro Hashimoto's deserves credit for , however belatedly , putting the ills of Ryutaro Hashimoto's country 's financial system on view . Curing them , however , requires steps that Japanese politicians still will not discuss in public : shutting sick institutions , laying their workers off , and wiping out their shareholders . Rather than topping up the banks ' capital , the government should use its money to pay off insured depositors as their banks are closed . In return , it should take over failed banks ' assets and sell them off - for cash only - to recoup some of its costs .

Since then, Mr Hashimoto's career has gone rather well. Which is more than can be said for the supervision of the financial system by his supposedly chastened civil servants. Reforms and initiatives there have been aplenty, all of them said to be the beginning of a new era.

Now, another new era is being announced. Following the arrests, the ministry says it will set up a new internal inspection group to stamp out collusion and corruption among its bureaucrats. If this is to be anything other than the latest hollow promise, this group will have to come up with more results, and fast. Even so, new internal controls are unlikely to give the ministry the credibility it needs. External controls, through an extended investigation by the Tokyo public prosecutor's office, would have a better chance.

ON CUE, Japan's finance minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka,resigned on January 27th, ostensibly to take responsibility for the arrest of two finance-ministry officials. The officials are said to have been bribed with golfing junkets and other entertainments in exchange for tips about the timing of ministry inspections. Between them, Asahi Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Sanwa Bank and the now bankrupt Hokkaido Takushoku Bank are said to have spent 9m ($72,ooo) on the two officials. A third official at the finance ministry who had been sought by the police was said to have hanged himself. 
The latest scandal to rock the Ministry of Finance began when a former ministry official was arrested a few weeks ago for, according to the police, taking bribes from Nomura, Japan's biggest securities firm. The bribes were small compared with the hoards of cash that have been pocketed by officials in other ministries. But they are being viewed seriously. The officials involved were said to be on the take during last summer's heated debate on administrative reform, when the separation of supervisory and inspection functions to prevent such behaviour was much discussed. They cannot plead ignorance. Back in December 1996, the ministry established ethical guidelines for officials. 
The finance ministry is on the defensive, allowing Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, to put a few teeth back into the financial reforms on which he has staked his career. They had been cynically deranged by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), many of whose members depend on the Ministry of Finance for handouts to their constituents. 
The arrests this week have helped Mr Hashimoto in other, more immediate, ways. The prime minister has been looking for a plausible excuse to get rid of Mr Mitsuzuka. The minister's fumblings had not convinced an increasingly impatient America that Japan had a grip on its financial problems, and was taking proper measures to boost its economy and so help its stricken Asian neighbours. 
It made matters even easier that Mr Mitsuzuka's head was being demanded by the opposition as the price for allowing through a 3 trillion supplementary budget, together with bills needed for injecting Y30 trillion of public money into Japan's ailing banking system. The LDP has enough members (258 out of 500) in the lower house of the Diet (parliament) to pass budgetary legislation (which does not need the upper house's approval). Even so, the opposition could have held things up. Through intermediaries, Mr Hashimoto had promised the Americans that he would have the economic package in place before the end of January. No sooner had Mr Mitsuzuka fallen on his sword than the package was winging its way through the Diet. 
Who will be the new finance minister? The faction headed by Mr Mitsuzuka wants to retain control of the job. Its choice is Sohei Miyashita, a former finance-ministry official, or Yoshiro Moni, a former cabinetmember. But the post is too importantprobably more important at the moment than the prime minister's-to be filled according to the dictates of factional politics. Mr Hashimoto wants someone with enough credibility to get the economy going. The markets are hoping for Kiichi Miyazawa, an old hand who, as finance minister, was more than a match for the ministry.

Aviation is one market where America has always had the edge over Japan, thanks to an unbalanced bilateral deal signed in the early 1950s when the Japanese bargaining position was weak. But the new agreement, though appearing to fix that imbalance, actually contains a secret protocol that makes further valuable concessions to the Americans. And those concessions are guaranteed to enrage the Europeans, who might seek to prevent the agreement coming into force. 
Under the terms of the deal, Japan wins parity with America, in that both sides have two passenger and one cargo airline as ""designated carriers"", rather than three American carriers and only one Japanese carrier as at present. But the Americans get most of what they really wanted: unlimited rights to pick up passengers in Japan and fly them to third countries; greater access to the Japanese market for some of their other airlines; and permission to allow a form of collaboration between American and Japanese carriers that is known as ""code-sharing"". This involves joint-marketing by labelling flights with either airline's twoletter code. 
The Europeans, however, are furious about a secret undertaking given by the Japanese transport ministry. This allows America's Federal Express to sell some of its unused freight slots (for a rumoured $iom each) to other, non-designated American airlines. The plan is to provide American Airlines, Continental and Delta, which currently have limited services to Japan, with a total of an additional 28 slots a week at Narita, plus a further 62 slots a week at less busy airports in the Japanese provinces. 
This secret pledge is a serious breach of the norms governing international aviation deals-especially the ""use it or lose it"" principle according to which unused takeoff or landing slots should be redistributed to the airlines that are next in the queue. Indeed, the Europeans may well cut Japanese airlines' access to airport hubs such as London, Frankfurt and Paris in an attempt to prevent the trade agreement being signed. 
Even if Japan manages somehow to skirt such retaliatory actions, the question remains about how the 28 new weekly slots at Narita will be used. Allocated originally to a cargo carrier, they are all either early in the morning or late at night. That is fine for parcels, but passengers hate arriving or departing at such ungodly hours. 
One rumour is that the American carriers wanting better access to Japan have been told by the Department of Transportation in Washington that Japan will ensure they get prime-time slots. In short, despite the hour of the slots that they have bought, they will be allowed to schedule their arrival and departure times at Narita between 2pm and 6pm, the most popular period of the day. 
The Japanese authorities deny that any such assurance has been given. Certainly, no guarantee that prime-time slots will be made available has been put in writing though it never could be, for political as well as legal reasons. And in his capacity as the current president of the European Union, Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, was recently reassured in Tokyo by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese prime minister, that Japan would not favour American airlines over the rest. 
Yet something is afoot. The Europeans suspect that the Japanese authorities secretly hope to bump up the number of slots per hour at Narita during the afternoon from 28 to roughly 30. If so, more fool the Europeans. It was the European Commission that showed them how to engineer this last March, when it sent a team of air-traffic control experts from London's Gatwick airport to Narita to recommend ways of increasing the number of aircraft movements at the airport without jeopardising safety or the environment. 
At the time, the Europeans sought access to Narita for their own carriers. With only a quarter of the number of slots that American airlines currently enjoy(see chart on previous page), European carriers feel they have a better claim on any new ones that become available.

WHEN the finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven rich countries gather in London on February 21st, all eyes will be on Hikaru Matsunaga,Japan's new finance minister. His colleagues hope to hear what Mr Matsunaga is going to do about reviving the Japanese economy. But they will be bitterly disappointed. That Mr Matsunaga may seem a little bewildered is understandable. His predecessor was obliged to resign last month to take responsibility for the latest bribery scandal to rock the finance ministry. Someone with international stature was supposed to get the job. Mr Matsunaga is not that man. He was neither prepared nor qualified to take over, and was not the leading choice, by a long way. 
One of the first things Mr Matsunaga said, soon after being appointed, was that on no account would any more Japanese banks or insurance firms be allowed to fail-definitely not what financial reformers had hoped to hear. In allowing Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Yamaichi Securities to go broke late last year, the finance ministry was thought at last to be allowing insolvent banks to go bust. This is considered crucial if the Japanese banking system-with gamma Y78 trillion ($617 billion) of dud loans admitted to so far-is to be saved. 
A lawyer by training, Mr Matsunaga's main claim to fame is that, briefly many years ago, he worked as a public prosecutor in the provinces. This, claimed Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, made him ideally qualified to knock the finance ministry into shape. Maybe, but as far as the outside world is concerned, a far more pressing need is for Japan to help pull the East Asian tigers out of their currency mess; and even more urgent than that, to prevent the Japanese economy from dragging the rest of the world's down with it. 
With bankruptcies at a record level and its financial markets jittery (see page 73), the vast majority of Japan's 68m working people-with a few exceptions (see box above-are so worried about keeping their jobs that they have virtually ceased buying anything but essentials. With private consumption accounting for nearly 60% of GDP, economic growth this year is set to turn negative-for the first time since the oil crisis savaged the economy in 1974. 
The government began dropping hints about an economic package to stimulate the economy earlier this year. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was set to agree to the package on February 20th, although the details are not supposed to be released until after deliberations are completed on the budget for fiscal 1998. That budget is already running late, and is unlikely to be passed before April ist. 
The government finds it politically difficult to admit that, after tightening belts last year, a package of measures to stimulate the economy represents a major u-turn. There have been a number of nudges and winks from the ruling party about how big the measures to boost the economy might be.

Then Takeo Hiranuma, head of the LDP's finance committee, started hinting it would be nearer Y10 trillion. 
In part, this is to convince foreigners that Japan is serious about reviving domestic consumption, rather than relying on exports to get itself out of trouble. But a more pressing reason is to talk the stockmarket up. The government would like the Nikkei average index back above 18,000-where it was before Mr Hashimoto's government sent the economy into a tail-spin with its austerity measures. 
If the Nikkei index were to slip back below the 15,000 level which it hit late last year, another wave of banking failures would ensue. The opposition would then have a field day by claiming that Mr Hashimoto's management of the economy had been disastrous. In the circumstances, the only course left open to him would be to resign in exchange for getting the 1998 budget through parliament. 
So far, all the talk of a big new economic stimulus being in the pipeline has worked. The stockmarket has recovered. But investors have acted as though the money has already been spent. So if the package is much smaller than expected, it could cause the stockmarket to crash again, making even more Japanese banks go bust. ","TOKYO 
 WHEN the finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven rich countries gather in London on February 21st , all eyes will be on Hikaru Matsunaga , Japan 's new finance minister . His colleagues hope to hear what Mr Matsunaga is going to do about reviving the Japanese economy . But they will be bitterly disappointed . That Mr Matsunaga may seem a little bewildered is understandable . His predecessor was obliged to resign last month to take responsibility for the latest bribery scandal to rock the finance ministry . Someone with international stature was supposed to get the job . Mr Matsunaga is not that man . He was neither prepared nor qualified to take over , and was not the leading choice , by a long way . 
 One of the first things Mr Matsunaga said , soon after being appointed , was that on no account would any more Japanese banks or insurance firms be allowed to fail - definitely not what financial reformers had hoped to hear . In allowing Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Yamaichi Securities to go broke late last year , the finance ministry was thought at last to be allowing insolvent banks to go bust . This is considered crucial if the Japanese banking system - with gamma Y78 trillion ( $ 617 billion ) of dud loans admitted to so far - is to be saved . 
 A lawyer by training , Mr Matsunaga 's main claim to fame is that , briefly many years ago , he worked as a public prosecutor in the provinces . This , claimed Ryutaro Hashimoto's , made him ideally qualified to knock the finance ministry into shape . Maybe , but as far as the outside world is concerned , a far more pressing need is for Japan to help pull the East Asian tigers out of their currency mess ; and even more urgent than that , to prevent the Japanese economy from dragging the rest of the world 's down with it . 
 With bankruptcies at a record level and its financial markets jittery ( see page 73 ) , the vast majority of Japan 's 68 m working people - with a few exceptions ( see box above - are so worried about keeping their jobs that they have virtually ceased buying anything but essentials . With private consumption accounting for nearly 60 % of GDP , economic growth this year is set to turn negative - for the first time since the oil crisis savaged the economy in 1974 . 
 The government began dropping hints about an economic package to stimulate the economy earlier this year . The ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) was set to agree to the package on February 20th , although the details are not supposed to be released until after deliberations are completed on the budget for fiscal 1998 . That budget is already running late , and is unlikely to be passed before April ist . 
 The government finds it politically difficult to admit that , after tightening belts last year , a package of measures to stimulate the economy represents a major u - turn . There have been a number of nudges and winks from the ruling party about how big the measures to boost the economy might be . Hiromu Nonaka , the LDP 's acting secretary - general , suggested that an emergency package of Y6 trillion was in the offing . Then Takeo Hiranuma , head of the LDP 's finance committee , started hinting it would be nearer Y10 trillion .

TOKYO'S Big Bang of financial-sector reform is supposed to start on April ist. Yet between now and close of business on March 31st, the government will be doing its best to rig the country's stockmarket so that the Nikkei index ends the financial year above 18,000. Financial deregulation was meant to drive Japan-in the words of Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister-towards ""free, fair and global"" markets. Its continuing efforts to fix the stockmarket suggest that the government does not yet understand these terms. 
Fear lies behind the government's reluctance to lend substance to its fine words on deregulation. Last November two big Japanese financial firms collapsed: Yamaichi (the country's fourth-largest stockbroker) and Hokkaido Takushoku, a commercial bank. Confidence was evaporating. Wisely, the Bank of Japan responded by supplying liquidity to the banking system-but both it and the finance ministry also did something much less wise. Rather than seize the opportunity to close insolvent banks, they chose to prop up all the big ones, regardless. They will surely regret it. By keeping the worst in business, they avoided the pain of closures, but at the cost of condemning better banks to meagre profits for years. 
The authorities are also desperate to stimulate bank credit. Companies find banks less willing to lend than before. If banks felt fitter, the argument goes, they would lend, and companies would invest, more freely. This is probably wrong too. As the economy slows, banks are rightly worried about their borrowers' health. For their part, many firms have no desire to borrow more; the weak economy has led them to scale back investments. However, the flawed logic suggested a bogus solution: bolster banks' capital by fair means and foul. Public cash is one way. Even healthy banks have been armtwisted into accepting taxpayers' money so that weaker rivals would not stand out for doing so. This week all 21 of Japan's biggest banks applied for identical sums of public cash, though the amount that they will get has shrivelled from the Y30 trillion ($237 billion) first mooted to just Y2 trillion. 
That the authorities, it now transpires, are prepared to spend so little is probably why they have been keen to gerrymander so much elsewhere. They have let banks manipulate their accounting so that they can show their holdings of land and securities in the best light. They have delayed, for a year at least, the implementation of ""prompt corrective action"", under which banks whose capital falls below a certain level would be forced to restructure. And they have done all they could to boost the stockmarket, for Japanese banks can count profits on shares towards their capital-which explains the struggle to get the Nikkei back above 18,000, its level of March 1997, by the end of the month. The latest wheeze to this end, suggested by Taku Yamasaki, in charge of economic policy in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, is to use money from the postal-savings system. 
Introduction to finance 
Tokyo's mandarins thought that financial deregulation would be a relatively painless exercise. Now they realise that this is not so. Swift financial deregulation will increase bankruptcies and unemployment, both of which are already at record highs. Difficult as it is for politicians to accept, both are necessary. Only by allowing banks and companies that squander money to fail will capital be efficiently allocated and returns for savers rise. It is largely because Japan's financial system has kept even the worst companies in business that returns for investors have been so pitiful. 
Some aspects of financial deregulation are still on track. The barriers separating the various bits of the financial system will be dismantled over the next few years, giving savers more choice. That is good. But the government still fails to see that it can prop up the banks and the stockmarket, or else it can create an efficient financial system. It cannot do both.

In this article our Tokyo correspondent tries to unravel what has gone wrong. In the next article, a Japanese economist explores what the future may hold for his country 
NOT long ago, foreigners flocked to Japan to see how things were done. The Japanese economy was the envy of the world, and its financial markets the source of stupendous wealth. Countries scrambled for Japanese investment. Much of it poured into America-to buy bonds, property and companies, and to build factories for Japanese manufacturers who had reinvented entire industries, such as consumer electronics and car making.Japanese firms were studied as models of efficiency and innovation, and their ideas of employee involvement, quality control and design were.put to work around the world. 
How things change Nowadays few foreigners travel to Japan in search of answers. Instead they come from Washington, Brussels and other capitals to prod the Japanese government into reviving a moribund economy. The foreigners cannot understand why paralysis is so widespread, and so entrenched. They worry that Japan's . sluggishness threatens not only to plunge East Asia into even deeper financial turmoil, but to drag down a large part of the world's economy with it. How, they ask, could so many talented people make such a mess of things in so short a time? That is the Japan puzzle. The answers are complex, but unravelling them points the way for Japan to get out of its mess. 
The hardest question to answer is why the Japanese political and administrative machine has ceased to function as effectively as it once did. It is fashionable to describe the sense of national helplessness and inactivity that grips the country as the ""Japanese disease"". Mariko Sugahara Bando, a former top official in the prime minister's office, and now a deputy governor of Saitama prefecture, lists five notable symptoms of the malady: a weakening of the Japanese work ethic; excessive homogeneity and conformity; a loss of creativity; a diminishing sense of public spirit; and a huge resistance to tapping the productive potential of women and the elderly. 
Ms Sugahara Bando argues that the diligence for which the Japanese were known in the post-war years was not a lasting manifestation of national character. It was never anything more, she says, than a temporary phenomenon peculiar to a specific phase in the country's economic development. In general, she believes that values drummed into a society tend not to last for more than a generation. That was especially true of the values of imperial Japan, whose rulers fanned the flames of patriotism and militarism until there was nothing left but ashes. Nowadays, she says, the tradition of unrewarded service and unjustified self-sacrifice-whether as a conscripted soldier in the imperial army or as a latter-day sarariman putting in a grinding 8o-hour week in the hope that it would provide a job for life-is at an end. And there is always a reaction to excess. 
Richer lives 
Nevertheless, some would see the decline of the work ethic in Japan as a healthy development-suggesting that the Japanese have finally become rich enough to be able to live fuller, easier lives. And the country's loss of creativity is noticeable only when the present generation is compared with predecessors from the 1930s, or earlier. The conformity of society and the reluctance to allow women to play a more active role in political and commercial life are age-old problems in Japan. Serious attempts are actually being made to improve matters. With their growing economic clout and better education, women are demanding-and getting-a better share of the corporate spoils. Meanwhile, classrooms throughout Japan nowadays display signs saying, ""Let's All Be Individuals"" (Altogether, now, repeat after me. .). 
The one thing Ms Sugahara Bando is clearly right about is Japan's declining sense of public spirit and civic morals. The wave of political, bureaucratic and business scandals that have hit the headlines are testament to a widespread weakening of the special glue (the Japanese call it hitonami no seikatsu) that has bound society into tight-knit groups since feudal times. 
Exactly how all this contributes to the national muddle is harder to say. A little easier to untangle is how Japan's reversal of fortunes came about The country is still suffering from a terrible bad-debt hangover. Many of the debts were run up by banks in a binge of reckless lending during the ""bubble economy"" of the late 1980s. This deflated in the early 1990s, dragging down the stockmarket by nearly 60% and property prices by around 80%. Lots of banks never made proper provision for the consequent bad debts, many of which remain on their balance sheets. In part this was because the banks thought the economywould grow fast enough to allow some of the debts to be repaid eventually, or at least written off less painfully. 
Yet GDP is likely to contract this year for the first time since the oil crisis a quarter of a century ago (see chart).As a result, the baddebt problem looms ever larger. It has now forced the government to stump up w30 trillion ($233 billion) to prevent the entire banking system from collapsing. 
Springtime austerity 
The looming recession comes as a major blow. Last spring, the economy seemed to be growing healthily. Impatient to claim credit for getting the country's growing budget deficit under control, the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, then increased the consumption tax by two percentage points (to 5%) and ushered in an austeritv bud et that slashed public spending, raised welfare contributions and withdrew temporary tax concessions introduced only a few years before. The net effect was to squeeze vg trillion from demand. 
No one faults Mr Hashimoto's determination to get a grip on the budget. The accumulated deficit run up by central and local governments during the immediate post-bubble years had become nearly as big as (and is now bigger than) the country's GDP. When pension liabilities were added, the government found itself staring into a gaping hole twice the size of GDP. Just servicing that debt now takes the biggest slice (22%) out of the national budget-accounting for more than education, defence and pensions combined. 
What people do fault is Mr Hashimoto's timing. The government believed that last spring's recovery was real, and that, with the yen once again falling against the dollar, Japan had put the worst of the postbubble years behind it. In reality, growth stemmed mainly from the huge amounts of public spending-some Y75 trillion all told-that had been shovelled into the economy in emergency measures taken between 1992 and 1995. 
Unfortunately, Mr Hashimoto and his advisers in the finance ministry had assumed that this money was being spent effectively. As is now known, half the emergency injections were squandered. Money was poured into building such things as tunnels through mountains that lead to nowhere of importance and new harbours for dying fishing villages. Even the beds of some rivers were concreted, supposedly to improve their flow. It was all very good for Japanese construction firms, which needed the work, but it did little to boost real economic activity. And wherever increased public spending did result in generating more wealth, many Japanese, worried about losing their jobs and their investments in the floundering economy, immediately stuffed any extra cash they had acquired into their mattresses instead of buying goods and services. 
Without realising that the real economy was actually on its knees, Mr Hashimoto then unwittingly put the boot in. Along with his fiscal measures came proposals for streamlining government, reforming education, controlling welfare costs, removing archaic business practices and, most radical of all, deregulating financial services with a ""big bang"". Though all these changes were desirable, it was too ambitious to embark on them all at once. To implement any one of them properly would have been a full-time job for the government. 
Half the reforms directly affected the powerful finance ministry. And because no one else was technically qualified, it was to finance-ministry officials that Mr Hashimoto mostly turned for advice. The unfortunate result was that, instead of concentrating on getting the economy rolling again, many people at the finance ministry devoted most of their waking hours to thinking up ever more ingenious ways of pandering to the prime minister's wishes, while at the same time ensuring that they could hang on to their own particular piece of turf. ""They wasted 80% of the time and resources this way,"" says Haruo Shimada, an economics professor at Keio University and a member of the prime minister's administrative reform council. In this way, Mr Hashimoto-aided and abetted by an army of government officials-stopped the Japanese economy in its tracks. 
Was this simply a tactical blunder, or a sign of something more fundamentally wrong with Japan? Though social pathologists are reluctant to point to the source of the ""Japanese disease"", the epidemiological evidence leads to the civil service in general, and the finance ministry in particular. Japanese civil servants exist in an intellectual hot-house that breeds a special monoculture capable of extraordinary feats of policy analysis, but strangely lacking in any form of hybrid vigour and common sense. 
Men from the ministry 
The finance ministry is particularly important because of the unique way that Japan conducts its political business. Like few other parliamentary democracies, Japan relies excessively on the civil service-especially the finance ministry-to create policy, produce legislation and get laws passed. Japan's system is not a partnership between the cabinet setting the policy direction, the bureaucracy researching the various options and helping with the legal language, and the elected politicians in the Diet (parliament) then arguing the toss and voting on the bills. 
The well-spring of all legislation in Japan is the bureaucracythe country's only institution capable of weighing competing ideas and formulating workable solutions. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) handed the policy-forming job over at around the time the party came together in the mid-1950s. Since then practically all new legislation has started life at some low level within a ministry. It then works its way up until it is judged polished enough to be presented to the Diet. Bureaucrats are called in to handle any tricky questions that may emerge while the ensuing legislation is being debated. The relevant minister's job is simply to shepherd the bill in question through hearings. Meanwhile, the cabinet's role is to co-ordinate the legislative agenda and to seek a consensus with other political parties. 
The result is that a Japanese prime minister has little real power. The only clout he has over recalcitrant politicians is his authority to dissolve the Diet and call a snap election. Ministers are worse off. Posts are handed out as long-service medals-primarily to impress constituents back home. With a queue of superannuated members waiting for their rewards, ministers tend to spend no more than a year in their post before being reshuffled so that others can have a turn. Few cabinet ministers in Japan ever leave their mark on the fiefs they are supposed to direct. 
Such an arrangement creates an enormous vacuum, which is readily filled by ambitious bureaucrats. With no one to check them, these civil servants find they have considerable freedom to do what they want-and to make mistakes. Though Japanese bureaucrats are as highly educated as their counterparts anywhere, they have a surprisingly long record of making very poor decisions. 
In 1984, for instance, when Japan first started liberalising its financial markets, the finance ministry adopted a string of measures that bequeathed a financial system that now urgently needs to be dismantled. The Japanese government has been lett with little choice but to introduce its big-bang reforms in such a way that will ensure that half the country's banks, stockbrokers and insurance firms go bust. The earlier deregulations carried out in other financial capitals around the world caused waves, but never such traumatic results. 
With the economy limping into recession, there is now even less room for blunders to be made with impunity. But that creates an even greater reluctance by government officials to take risks. And this aggravates even further Japan's frustrating inability to get things done. 
So too does the increasing technical inadequacy of many of the country's bureaucrats. Technological innovation has left officials trained as generalists unable to grasp many of the issues that they now have to confront. Bureaucratic shortcomings occur in all countries, but in Japan officials assume wide-ranging powers for the kind of detailed policymaking that is done by expert groups in countries elsewhere. With no practical market experience to help them, and economics graduates few and far between, even finance-ministry officials admit they are often at sea, for instance, when trying to understand, let alone attempt to regulate, some of the derivative-based instruments that are nowadays the common tools of modern finance. 
Similar inadequacies occur in other ministries. A fiasco involving HIV, the virus responsible for AIDs, arose a few years ago because the health ministry lacked the biochemical knowledge to determine appropriate safety standards for a new medical process.As a result, tainted blood was given to some 4,ooo haemophiliacs, more than 400 of whom have now died. In the health ministry, the sins of incompetence were compounded by criminal attempts to conceal evidence of the mistakes. 
Other examples abound. Japan's recent enactment of a product-liability law assigns the responsibility of judging the safety of products and procedures to the companies that develop them, but is designed to protect not so much the public but the government. ""It reflects the fact that ministries, like the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, feel unable to carry this responsibility,"" notes Ryuichiro Matsubara, an economist at Tokyo University. The more technology proliferates, the more difficult it will be for bureaucrats, trained to argue the niceties of legal consistency, to control their industries using such clumsy tools as administrative guidance. 
Another trend making policy formation more difficult than ever for Japanese civil servants is that business and society have changed abruptly. By 199o, as the bubble economy reached its peak, the goals set by the bureaucracy a generation before-to catch up with the West in living standards as well as industry and business-had been achieved. ""The Japan Inc paradigm has collapsed,"" says Tetsuzo Yamamoto, an economist at Waseda University. 
Lost at sea 
So how can Japan set about charting a new course? Its old map had nothing on it about the end of the cold war, the globalisation of markets, the rise of China, or the invention of the Internet. Japanese officials know they must head off towards some form of deregulation: in tables comparing the extent to which different countries' economies are subject to regulation, Japan ranks 35h (below even Russia) with 30% of its economy still tied up in tape, compared with America's 7%, according to Japan's Fair Trade Commission. 
Yet officials hesitate for fear of losing still more of their diminishing responsibilities. These are important within Japanese ministries, not simply for the power and influence they bring over swathes of the economy, but also for the well-paid jobs their connections provide when, in order to pad out meagre pensions and make room for others moving up, senior civil servants ""descend from heaven""-as the Japanese say-into the private sector. 
Japan has reached the limits of bureaucratic control. No longer restricted to a few bad apples, corruption within ministries able to influence all kinds of business has become endemic, even a way of life. The calibre of the bureaucracy's young elite, drawn as ever from the fastest stream of Tokyo University's law department, remains academically clever-and just as narrowminded as before. 
Two changes seem necessary if Japan is to solve its policy impasse. First, the cabinet must snatch back decisionmaking authority from the civil service. As the constitution prescribes, the cabinet should set the agenda and insist that the relevant ministries provide policy options and not ready-made legislation that is honed for administrative convenience. That would mean that the political parties would have to strengthen their think-tanks. Most have been reluctant to do so because of the high cost. As elsewhere, the answer lies in co-opting lively academics, businessmen, labour leaders and financiers. 
The second change required is a big bureaucratic shake-up. There is too much inbreeding. The best way to revitalise sclerotic government departments would initially be to throw open their doors to a wider group, with a special effort to recruit technocrats from companies in the private sector. At the same time, the brightest civil servants should be encouraged to get their fingers dirty by spending time working in finance and industry, rather than expecting to encounter the real world only in the twilight of their careers. Openness and improvements to civil service pensions should help prevent corruption. 
It would be hard for Japan to make such changes quickly but, unless it makes some attempt to dismantle its government-bybureaucracy, then the ""system fatigue"" found at the centre of the Japan puzzle will continue to paralyse policymaking. Sooner or later that will mean that the machinery of government itself will snap. That would be a catastrophe, not only for Japan, but for the rest of the world. ","Much of the world is alarmed at Japan 's inability to reform its economy . In this article our Tokyo correspondent tries to unravel what has gone wrong . In the next article , a Japanese economist explores what the future may hold for his country 
 NOT long ago , foreigners flocked to Japan to see how things were done . The Japanese economy was the envy of the world , and its financial markets the source of stupendous wealth . Countries scrambled for Japanese investment . Much of it poured into America - to buy bonds , property and companies , and to build factories for Japanese manufacturers who had reinvented entire industries , such as consumer electronics and car making . Japanese firms were studied as models of efficiency and innovation , and their ideas of employee involvement , quality control and design were.put to work around the world . 
 How things change Nowadays few foreigners travel to Japan in search of answers . Instead they come from Washington , Brussels and other capitals to prod the Japanese government into reviving a moribund economy . The foreigners can not understand why paralysis is so widespread , and so entrenched . They worry that Japan 's . sluggishness threatens not only to plunge East Asia into even deeper financial turmoil , but to drag down a large part of the world 's economy with it . How , they ask , could so many talented people make such a mess of things in so short a time ? That is the Japan puzzle . The answers are complex , but unravelling them points the way for Japan to get out of its mess . 
 The hardest question to answer is why the Japanese political and administrative machine has ceased to function as effectively as it once did . It is fashionable to describe the sense of national helplessness and inactivity that grips the country as the "" Japanese disease "" . Mariko Sugahara Bando , a former top official in the prime minister 's office , and now a deputy governor of Saitama prefecture , lists five notable symptoms of the malady : a weakening of the Japanese work ethic ; excessive homogeneity and conformity ; a loss of creativity ; a diminishing sense of public spirit ; and a huge resistance to tapping the productive potential of women and the elderly . 
 Ms Sugahara Bando argues that the diligence for which the Japanese were known in the post - war years was not a lasting manifestation of national character . It was never anything more , she says , than a temporary phenomenon peculiar to a specific phase in the country 's economic development . In general , she believes that values drummed into a society tend not to last for more than a generation . That was especially true of the values of imperial Japan , whose rulers fanned the flames of patriotism and militarism until there was nothing left but ashes . Nowadays , she says , the tradition of unrewarded service and unjustified self - sacrifice - whether as a conscripted soldier in the imperial army or as a latter - day sarariman putting in a grinding 8o - hour week in the hope that it would provide a job for life - is at an end . And there is always a reaction to excess . 
 Richer lives 
 Nevertheless , some would see the decline of the work ethic in Japan as a healthy development - suggesting that the Japanese have finally become rich enough to be able to live fuller , easier lives . And the country 's loss of creativity is noticeable only when the present generation is compared with predecessors from the 1930s , or earlier . The conformity of society and the reluctance to allow women to play a more active role in political and commercial life are age - old problems in Japan . Serious attempts are actually being made to improve matters . With their growing economic clout and better education , women are demanding - and getting - a better share of the corporate spoils . Meanwhile , classrooms throughout Japan nowadays display signs saying , "" Let 's All Be Individuals "" ( Altogether , now , repeat after me . . ) . 
 The one thing Ms Sugahara Bando is clearly right about is Japan 's declining sense of public spirit and civic morals . The wave of political , bureaucratic and business scandals that have hit the headlines are testament to a widespread weakening of the special glue ( the Japanese call it hitonami no seikatsu ) that has bound society into tight - knit groups since feudal times . 
 Exactly how all this contributes to the national muddle is harder to say . A little easier to untangle is how Japan 's reversal of fortunes came about The country is still suffering from a terrible bad - debt hangover . Many of the debts were run up by banks in a binge of reckless lending during the "" bubble economy "" of the late 1980s . This deflated in the early 1990s , dragging down the stockmarket by nearly 60 % and property prices by around 80 % . Lots of banks never made proper provision for the consequent bad debts , many of which remain on their balance sheets . In part this was because the banks thought the economywould grow fast enough to allow some of the debts to be repaid eventually , or at least written off less painfully . 
 Yet GDP is likely to contract this year for the first time since the oil crisis a quarter of a century ago ( see chart).As a result , the baddebt problem looms ever larger . It has now forced the government to stump up w30 trillion ( $ 233 billion ) to prevent the entire banking system from collapsing . 
 Springtime austerity 
 The looming recession comes as a major blow . Last spring , the economy seemed to be growing healthily . Impatient to claim credit for getting the country 's growing budget deficit under control , Ryutaro Hashimoto , then increased the consumption tax by two percentage points ( to 5 % ) and ushered in an austeritv bud et that slashed public spending , raised welfare contributions and withdrew temporary tax concessions introduced only a few years before . The net effect was to squeeze vg trillion from demand . 
 No one faults Ryutaro Hashimoto's determination to get a grip on the budget . The accumulated deficit run up by central and local governments during the immediate post - bubble years had become nearly as big as ( and is now bigger than ) the country 's GDP . When pension liabilities were added , the government found itself staring into a gaping hole twice the size of GDP . Just servicing that debt now takes the biggest slice ( 22 % ) out of the national budget - accounting for more than education , defence and pensions combined . 
 What people do fault is Ryutaro Hashimoto's timing . The government believed that last spring 's recovery was real , and that , with the yen once again falling against the dollar , Japan had put the worst of the postbubble years behind it . In reality , growth stemmed mainly from the huge amounts of public spending - some Y75 trillion all told - that had been shovelled into the economy in emergency measures taken between 1992 and 1995 . 
 Unfortunately , Ryutaro Hashimoto and Ryutaro Hashimoto's advisers in the finance ministry had assumed that this money was being spent effectively . As is now known , half the emergency injections were squandered . Money was poured into building such things as tunnels through mountains that lead to nowhere of importance and new harbours for dying fishing villages . Even the beds of some rivers were concreted , supposedly to improve their flow . It was all very good for Japanese construction firms , which needed the work , but it did little to boost real economic activity . And wherever increased public spending did result in generating more wealth , many Japanese , worried about losing their jobs and their investments in the floundering economy , immediately stuffed any extra cash they had acquired into their mattresses instead of buying goods and services . 
 Without realising that the real economy was actually on its knees , Ryutaro Hashimoto then unwittingly put the boot in . Along with Ryutaro Hashimoto's fiscal measures came proposals for streamlining government , reforming education , controlling welfare costs , removing archaic business practices and , most radical of all , deregulating financial services with a "" big bang "" . Though all these changes were desirable , it was too ambitious to embark on them all at once . To implement any one of them properly would have been a full - time job for the government . 
 Half the reforms directly affected the powerful finance ministry . And because no one else was technically qualified , it was to finance - ministry officials that Ryutaro Hashimoto mostly turned for advice . The unfortunate result was that , instead of concentrating on getting the economy rolling again , many people at the finance ministry devoted most of their waking hours to thinking up ever more ingenious ways of pandering to Ryutaro Hashimoto's wishes , while at the same time ensuring that they could hang on to their own particular piece of turf . "" They wasted 80 % of the time and resources this way , "" says Haruo Shimada , an economics professor at Keio University and a member of Ryutaro Hashimoto's administrative reform council . In this way , Ryutaro Hashimoto - aided and abetted by an army of government officials - stopped the Japanese economy in its tracks . 
 Was this simply a tactical blunder , or a sign of something more fundamentally wrong with Japan ? Though social pathologists are reluctant to point to the source of the "" Japanese disease "" , the epidemiological evidence leads to the civil service in general , and the finance ministry in particular . Japanese civil servants exist in an intellectual hot - house that breeds a special monoculture capable of extraordinary feats of policy analysis , but strangely lacking in any form of hybrid vigour and common sense . 
 Men from the ministry 
 The finance ministry is particularly important because of the unique way that Japan conducts its political business . Like few other parliamentary democracies , Japan relies excessively on the civil service - especially the finance ministry - to create policy , produce legislation and get laws passed . Japan 's system is not a partnership between the cabinet setting the policy direction , the bureaucracy researching the various options and helping with the legal language , and the elected politicians in the Diet ( parliament ) then arguing the toss and voting on the bills . 
 The well - spring of all legislation in Japan is the bureaucracythe country 's only institution capable of weighing competing ideas and formulating workable solutions . The ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) handed the policy - forming job over at around the time the party came together in the mid-1950s . Since then practically all new legislation has started life at some low level within a ministry . It then works its way up until it is judged polished enough to be presented to the Diet . Bureaucrats are called in to handle any tricky questions that may emerge while the ensuing legislation is being debated . The relevant minister 's job is simply to shepherd the bill in question through hearings . Meanwhile , the cabinet 's role is to co - ordinate the legislative agenda and to seek a consensus with other political parties . 
 The result is that a Japanese prime minister has little real power . The only clout he has over recalcitrant politicians is his authority to dissolve the Diet and call a snap election . Ministers are worse off . Posts are handed out as long - service medals - primarily to impress constituents back home . With a queue of superannuated members waiting for their rewards , ministers tend to spend no more than a year in their post before being reshuffled so that others can have a turn . Few cabinet ministers in Japan ever leave their mark on the fiefs they are supposed to direct . 
 Such an arrangement creates an enormous vacuum , which is readily filled by ambitious bureaucrats . With no one to check them , these civil servants find they have considerable freedom to do what they want - and to make mistakes . Though Japanese bureaucrats are as highly educated as their counterparts anywhere , they have a surprisingly long record of making very poor decisions . 
 In 1984 , for instance , when Japan first started liberalising its financial markets , the finance ministry adopted a string of measures that bequeathed a financial system that now urgently needs to be dismantled . The Japanese government has been lett with little choice but to introduce its big - bang reforms in such a way that will ensure that half the country 's banks , stockbrokers and insurance firms go bust . The earlier deregulations carried out in other financial capitals around the world caused waves , but never such traumatic results . 
 With the economy limping into recession , there is now even less room for blunders to be made with impunity . But that creates an even greater reluctance by government officials to take risks . And this aggravates even further Japan 's frustrating inability to get things done . 
 So too does the increasing technical inadequacy of many of the country 's bureaucrats . Technological innovation has left officials trained as generalists unable to grasp many of the issues that they now have to confront . Bureaucratic shortcomings occur in all countries , but in Japan officials assume wide - ranging powers for the kind of detailed policymaking that is done by expert groups in countries elsewhere . With no practical market experience to help them , and economics graduates few and far between , even finance - ministry officials admit they are often at sea , for instance , when trying to understand , let alone attempt to regulate , some of the derivative - based instruments that are nowadays the common tools of modern finance . 
 Similar inadequacies occur in other ministries . A fiasco involving HIV , the virus responsible for AIDs , arose a few years ago because the health ministry lacked the biochemical knowledge to determine appropriate safety standards for a new medical process . As a result , tainted blood was given to some 4,ooo haemophiliacs , more than 400 of whom have now died . In the health ministry , the sins of incompetence were compounded by criminal attempts to conceal evidence of the mistakes . 
 Other examples abound . Japan 's recent enactment of a product - liability law assigns the responsibility of judging the safety of products and procedures to the companies that develop them , but is designed to protect not so much the public but the government . "" It reflects the fact that ministries , like the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Health and Welfare , feel unable to carry this responsibility , "" notes Ryuichiro Matsubara , an economist at Tokyo University . The more technology proliferates , the more difficult it will be for bureaucrats , trained to argue the niceties of legal consistency , to control their industries using such clumsy tools as administrative guidance . 
 Another trend making policy formation more difficult than ever for Japanese civil servants is that business and society have changed abruptly . By 199o , as the bubble economy reached its peak , the goals set by the bureaucracy a generation before - to catch up with the West in living standards as well as industry and business - had been achieved . "" The Japan Inc paradigm has collapsed , "" says Tetsuzo Yamamoto , an economist at Waseda University . 
 Lost at sea 
 So how can Japan set about charting a new course ? Its old map had nothing on it about the end of the cold war , the globalisation of markets , the rise of China , or the invention of the Internet . Japanese officials know they must head off towards some form of deregulation : in tables comparing the extent to which different countries ' economies are subject to regulation , Japan ranks 35h ( below even Russia ) with 30 % of its economy still tied up in tape , compared with America 's 7 % , according to Japan 's Fair Trade Commission . 
 Yet officials hesitate for fear of losing still more of their diminishing responsibilities . These are important within Japanese ministries , not simply for the power and influence they bring over swathes of the economy , but also for the well - paid jobs their connections provide when , in order to pad out meagre pensions and make room for others moving up , senior civil servants "" descend from heaven""-as the Japanese say - into the private sector . 
 Japan has reached the limits of bureaucratic control . No longer restricted to a few bad apples , corruption within ministries able to influence all kinds of business has become endemic , even a way of life . The calibre of the bureaucracy 's young elite , drawn as ever from the fastest stream of Tokyo University 's law department , remains academically clever - and just as narrowminded as before . 
 Two changes seem necessary if Japan is to solve its policy impasse . First , the cabinet must snatch back decisionmaking authority from the civil service . As the constitution prescribes , the cabinet should set the agenda and insist that the relevant ministries provide policy options and not ready - made legislation that is honed for administrative convenience . That would mean that the political parties would have to strengthen their think - tanks . Most have been reluctant to do so because of the high cost . As elsewhere , the answer lies in co - opting lively academics , businessmen , labour leaders and financiers . 
 The second change required is a big bureaucratic shake - up . There is too much inbreeding . The best way to revitalise sclerotic government departments would initially be to throw open their doors to a wider group , with a special effort to recruit technocrats from companies in the private sector . At the same time , the brightest civil servants should be encouraged to get their fingers dirty by spending time working in finance and industry , rather than expecting to encounter the real world only in the twilight of their careers . Openness and improvements to civil service pensions should help prevent corruption . 
 It would be hard for Japan to make such changes quickly but , unless it makes some attempt to dismantle its government - bybureaucracy , then the "" system fatigue "" found at the centre of the Japan puzzle will continue to paralyse policymaking . Sooner or later that will mean that the machinery of government itself will snap . That would be a catastrophe , not only for Japan , but for the rest of the world .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Ryutaro Hashimoto",11,True

Here Tadashi Nakamae, an independent economist, draws up three possible-and plausible-futures that could arise from Japan's current difficulties 
AFTER bumping in and out of growth and recession during the 199os, the past few months have been traumatic for Japan. Just as recovery seemed to be beginning, Asia's financial collapses have cast a new and uncomfortably penetrating light on the problems of Japan's own financial institutions. In truth, however, this new light has merely exposed an old reality: that Japan has failed during this decade to tackle the roots of its financial, economic and even political problems. Will that failure now be repeated?And if so, what would it mean for the country's long-term future? 
One way to provide an answer is simply to speculate. There is, however, another more interesting technique. That is to interview more than loo people involved with Japan in Asia, Europe and North America and then to collate their visions, worries and expectations into possible scenarios for the course Japan could follow during the next 20 years or so. Such ""scenario planning"" is not intended to offer a fixed forecast; rather, it helps to show how today's trends and challenges could shape tomorrow's Japan. 
With the help of a specialist scenarioplanning firm in San Francisco and London, Global Business Network, I and my colleagues have developed three main scenarios, which this article will describe, in the style of a historian writing in 2020. The first scenario reflects many people's fear that Japan will fail to make necessary structural changes, thanks to lobbying by antireform interest groups and a general failure to confront reality. The second scenario is more optimistic, plotting a course through which the interest groups' power is broken and a virtuous circle of reform develops. 
The third, however, throws a geopolitical spanner into the works: it explores the debate that a withdrawal of America's military presence in Asia would prompt, since it would force Japan to ponder its position in a region that has come to be more dominated by a growing China. This third scenario reaches 2010, conceived as the eve of a decisive vote on the sacrosanct Article 9 of the post-war constitution, which in effect forbids military action by Japan except in self-defence. 
And the conclusion? First, that no conclusion can be confident, once all Japan's complexities and challenges-environmental problems, the ageing population and Asian geopolitics as well as the familiar financial and economic issues-are taken into account. But also, second, that history suggests a clue for the future: that Japan is spurred into action only by a truly visible crisis or shock. For that reason, the present financial slump could prove a blessing, albeit disguised. 
1: The long hollowing 
In this first scenario, Japan's structural problems remain unreformed with the long-term result that the brightest and the best in Japan, both individuals and companies, leave the declining country. 
The seeds of the problem were sown in 1998-2000 when the Bank of Japan inter vened to support the banks rather than accept the reality that banks needed to fail and that even depositors might have to lose money. Some banks merged, some foreign firms came in as part of the rescue, but the structures remained the same. 
This failure to confront the problem and to defeat interest-group pressures meant that the critical momentum for other reforms in Japan was never established: at stake was far more than just fixing a banking problem. But at the time the central bank felt that once again it had succeeded where many had doubted Japan's resilience. After all, hadn't people been trying to write off Japan through most of the 1990s? Wasn't the bank rescuing Japan from a 1930s-style depression? The illusion that something was being done to improve structures was reinforced by a series of nominal reforms which in reality left regulation intact and the bureaucracy still in full command. 
The so-called financial ""big bang"", promoted in 1997 by the-then prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, turned into the big sigh, as passive lending by banks to companies over which they had little control remained the norm. Even the foreign banks that came into Japan during the crisis were content to operate under this protected system. Indeed, the limited competition that was introduced made members of the keiretsu industrial groups even more protective of each other, strengthening bankcompany ties. 
This perpetuation of a closed financing system which had served well in previous years was now a big handicap in world markets, especially as it continued to protect inefficient industries. Japan retained its dual economy of weak, domestically focused firms and a competitive export sector. The changes triggered off by foreign companies coming into Japan did nothing to alter the structure of the economy as a whole. Only around half of the population turned out to vote at elections, content to accept politicians' assurances that change was being enacted, or else merely showing their apathy. 
These problems were worsened by the lingering aftermath of the Asian financial crisis which had damaged Japanese investments in the region. By the early part of the new century the drive by Asian economies to rebuild their strength led them to redouble efforts to entice more firms to locate in their economies, a process helped by the new post-devaluation competitiveness of Asian currencies. Japanese companies grew, but outside Japan. 
Perhaps most critically, China was struggling to deal with its own challenges and beginning to assert its growing military power to divert attention away from its economic and resource problems. The United States made China the focal point of its Asian strategy, whilst continued trade friction undermined America's relations with Japan. The economically weak Japan had become a spectator of events in Asia. 
Within this limping, sidelined Japan the confidence of the young was further undermined by accumulating environmental deterioration. For example, the country was running out of waste-dumping capacity. Dioxin problems were worsening as more waste was burned. Illegal dumping of waste intensified outside the urban areas where controls were lax. The official reaction? To do nothing, but to excuse the relaxation of standards as they had been higher than in other countries. 
If Japan was becoming an increasingly unpleasant place in which to live, for the young in particular the demographic pressures were the most depressing. Japan was rapidly shifting from becoming the youngest of the industrial economies to the oldest. The older generations were taking action, setting up lobby groups to protect themselves. In 200z03, to pay for pensions, special income taxes were imposed and unemployment benefits were cut. Older workers were being protected in jobs as far as possible, whilst the young were having to be part of a growing ""contingent"" labour force, accepting more part-time and temporary work. 
For the first time in its history Japan experienced significant labour emigration as the young began to depart. The loss prevented Japan, already one of the least ""wired"" countries, from exploiting new technologies. The departure of the young was matched by the exodus of competitive companies. The new products of the IT world were made elsewhere. 
By z020 those Japanese now outside the country tended to conclude: ""It has become a wonderful time to be a global trading firm-not a great time to be in Japan."" 2: Crash and rebirth 
The second scenario, by contrast, is more optimistic. This explores how Japan could make an impressive turn-round, beginning with, perhaps, a 1999 ""bank-holiday crisis"", a turn-round which ends up with Japan firmly established as a respected world leader two decades later. In such circumstances, alongside the United States, Japan could use its advanced technology to ensure that China can ease its food and energy constraints without resorting to a destabilising takeover of the resources of Central Asia or the South China Sea. 
The first building-block of this success story was the willingness to confront the financial crisis of 1999, establishing the momentum for reform by taking Japan out of the grip of anti-reform interest groups. The new accounting self-assessment system for bank assets, introduced in 1997, began to reveal the extent ofthe banks' balance-sheet weakness in 1998. By 1999, after a year of trying to support the banks, the government finally gave up the attempt, overwhelmed by the size of the problem and market pressures. The ensuing collapse of bank share-prices, linked to an accompanying fall in other equity prices and an attempted unloading of cross-shareholdings for self-preservation, precipitated a new financial slump. The yen plummeted and the minister of finance closed banks: doors to stop panicky withdrawals of deposits. 
The rescue package then presented froze 25% of deposits of banks and postalsavings accounts into zo-year zero-coupon government bonds, using the resources to write-off all bad loans. All remaining bank deposits were guaranteed. Massive cuts in bank staffs and the resignation of bank directors followed with the banks' promises of deposit guarantees. The long-term benefit of this traumatic solution was to force a more open relationship between finance and business. 
These actions were followed up in October 1999 by a radical set of administrative reforms, requiring government companies to disclose and write off their hidden losses, a 30% cut in government and bureaucracy costs, extensive tax reform, industrial deregulation and the privatisation of pension funds. Such radicalism triggered a predictable counter-reaction by threatened interest groups but the reforms were endorsed in an election that returned a party by then called the Reformists, thanks to a massive jump in voter turnout, from 50% to 80%. Spurred by the shock of the banking crisis, Japan's previously apathetic people had realised that the momentum for reform had to be sustained. 
The election also saw the younger generations beginning to take more control. Reforms begat reforms, especially as positive results came through: after just five years, the nationalised banks were being returned to private ownership. Critical social reforms were enacted from 2oo8 onwards, for example encouraging more women to work and to marry, to raise fertility. Nor were the needs of the ageing population ignored. Policies to allow people to work longer helped to ease the burden on the pension funds (themselves now in better shape after pension-fund reform). Educational reform made students more flexible to meet the creative challenges of the knowledge economy. Some immigration was encouraged and finally the lifetime employment and pay-by-seniority systems were dismantled. 
Building on these reforms, from 2010 on there was a more conscious effort to improve the environment, giving incentives for pollution-control technologies, for new agricultural technologies, for recycling and for more R&D into the problems of global warming and ozone depletion. The emergent environmentalist culture in Japan gave a boost to ""green"" technologies, led by car firms, who were now able to follow up their early successes in introducing the world's first green cars in the 199os. Research cut sulphur and nitrogen emissions drastically. Breakthroughs cut dioxins, thereby helping to combat the fall in the fertility rate. Many of these new technologies also generated profitable new business in China's booming market. 
It was indeed China which provided the arena in which Japan's advances paid off. The demand for grain in China, which needed to feed a further 12m people every year, and its massive rise in energy consumption, had encouraged the Chinese government to cast its eyes westwards, to the resources of Central Asia. Tensions rose as America and Russia took steps to block China's moves to take over these resources. Japan, bound to peaceful action only by Artide 9 of the constitution, was desperate to prevent conflict in Asia which would damage trade and would destabilise the region profoundly. 
After three years of tension, in 28 the Japanese prime minister proposed a tripartite solution whereby the United States and Japan used their advanced technologies to assist China in improving crop yields and increasing energy efficiency. This event signalled Japan's ability to meet its many challenges. Without the advances pioneered by its new, technologically astute young workforce, conscious of the need to protect the environment, a peaceful solution to the geopolitical tensions of Asia might not have been found. The China solution was the symbol of the success of the new Japan, a nation reborn from the seeds of the tough measures taken to confront structural weaknesses at the turn of the millennium. 3: Hercules departs 
The third scenario is not, in truth, an alternative to the first two. But it describes and elaborates upon the biggest single external shock that could shape Japan during the next two decades. This could occur regardless of which of the first two scenarios comes about; and if it does, it will greatly complicate Japan's situation. 
This shock is the withdrawal of American troops from Asia, which would pose big security dilemmas for Japan. The result, in this scenario, is that in July 2010japan is engaged in an intense debate over whether to amend Article 9 of the constitution, which in effect forbids military action except in self-defence. Japan faced the need, for the first time for 65 years, to look after its own security. 
America's troop withdrawal was driven by a number of circumstances. Within the United States itself, as the economy slowed in 2001-2, the Republican president looked for ways to husband fiscal resources so as to allow a recovery by the 2004 election. At the same time, more Americans were expressing their discomfort with their country's role as world policeman. A war hero, the president was able to use his reputation to take advantage of an opportunity emerging in Asia. 
In Asia the American military presence looked more and more anachronistic as some key issues edged towards some sort of solution. First, as the North Korean regime crumbled in 2002-03 and the two Koreas finally united, the United States agreed to reduce its presence in return for an agreement by China to stay out of the Koreas. In January 2003 the president announced his new policy, redeploying troops from forward positions to Hawaii by 2010, leaving some based in Guam. The Security Treaty with Japan was preserved, the idea being that new military strategies and power-projection capabilities would allow for this troop pullback. Worries about China's size and weight remained, but were at least assuaged by its still-peaceful proprietorship of Hong Kong. At first there was little obvious reaction in Asia. 
But in 2005 China began to test the waters with some subtle but noticeable discrimination against Japanese companies in China, to gauge the strength of a Japan with reduced American support. In 2007 China went further, by suggesting quietly that companies operating in Taiwan might be less than welcome in China. America looked the other way, in stark contrast to the explicit warnings given almost a decade earlier during the Taiwan crisis of 1996. Taiwan realised that accommodation with China was likely to be necessary. By 2008 Japan was in an increasingly difficult position as reality began to sink in. Five separate factions emerged in the debate over Japan's foreign and security policy. Of the five, only the Pacifists held out against a revision of Article 9. 
The Nationalists called for Japan to shake off the whole panoply of its American-based constitution and economic system and to reassert Japan's rightful place in the world-at home to re-establish Japanese values and abroad to resist Chinese imperialism. The Pacifists, in contrast, believed that peace still could be attained through diplomatic means. But while vocal, the Pacifists tended to be disunited and many Japanese saw this approach as being too risky. 
The third faction, the pro-America Conservatives, called for a rebuilding of a strong relationship with the United States in order to facilitate unrestrained co-operation between American and Japanese forces. The fourth, Pan-Asian faction, preferred Japan to try to engage China not to isolate it, and to work towards a Pan-Asian multilateral security framework, involving Japanese forces. 
Finally, the ASE_AN faction (advocating an Association of South-East and Eastern Asian Nations) also favoured a more Asian solution but one where nations of AsEAN and the United Koreas should build a security arrangement to counter the power of China. America was not to be trusted and Japan would need to rebuild its forces. 
Whilst the vote looked as if it would swing in favour of Article 9 revision, whatever the result, the future of foreign policy is uncertain. With American support departing, the very identity of Japan was at stake. 
Of course, this may never happen. But wht if if did. ","Do Japan's financial troubles doom it to stagnation, or might it rebound as Asia's strongest and most vibrant country?

The third, however, throws a geopolitical spanner into the works: it explores the debate that a withdrawal of America's military presence in Asia would prompt, since it would force Japan to ponder its position in a region that has come to be more dominated by a growing China. This third scenario reaches 2010, conceived as the eve of a decisive vote on the sacrosanct Article 9 of the post-war constitution, which in effect forbids military action by Japan except in self-defence. 
And the conclusion? First, that no conclusion can be confident, once all Japan's complexities and challenges-environmental problems, the ageing population and Asian geopolitics as well as the familiar financial and economic issues-are taken into account. But also, second, that history suggests a clue for the future: that Japan is spurred into action only by a truly visible crisis or shock. For that reason, the present financial slump could prove a blessing, albeit disguised. 
1: The long hollowing 
In this first scenario, Japan's structural problems remain unreformed with the long-term result that the brightest and the best in Japan, both individuals and companies, leave the declining country. 
The seeds of the problem were sown in 1998-2000 when the Bank of Japan inter vened to support the banks rather than accept the reality that banks needed to fail and that even depositors might have to lose money. Some banks merged, some foreign firms came in as part of the rescue, but the structures remained the same. 
This failure to confront the problem and to defeat interest-group pressures meant that the critical momentum for other reforms in Japan was never established: at stake was far more than just fixing a banking problem. But at the time the central bank felt that once again it had succeeded where many had doubted Japan's resilience. After all, hadn't people been trying to write off Japan through most of the 1990s? Wasn't the bank rescuing Japan from a 1930s-style depression? The illusion that something was being done to improve structures was reinforced by a series of nominal reforms which in reality left regulation intact and the bureaucracy still in full command. 
The so-called financial ""big bang"", promoted in 1997 by the-then prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, turned into the big sigh, as passive lending by banks to companies over which they had little control remained the norm. Even the foreign banks that came into Japan during the crisis were content to operate under this protected system. Indeed, the limited competition that was introduced made members of the keiretsu industrial groups even more protective of each other, strengthening bankcompany ties. 
This perpetuation of a closed financing system which had served well in previous years was now a big handicap in world markets, especially as it continued to protect inefficient industries. Japan retained its dual economy of weak, domestically focused firms and a competitive export sector. The changes triggered off by foreign companies coming into Japan did nothing to alter the structure of the economy as a whole. Only around half of the population turned out to vote at elections, content to accept politicians' assurances that change was being enacted, or else merely showing their apathy. 
These problems were worsened by the lingering aftermath of the Asian financial crisis which had damaged Japanese investments in the region. By the early part of the new century the drive by Asian economies to rebuild their strength led them to redouble efforts to entice more firms to locate in their economies, a process helped by the new post-devaluation competitiveness of Asian currencies. Japanese companies grew, but outside Japan. 
Perhaps most critically, China was struggling to deal with its own challenges and beginning to assert its growing military power to divert attention away from its economic and resource problems. The United States made China the focal point of its Asian strategy, whilst continued trade friction undermined America's relations with Japan. The economically weak Japan had become a spectator of events in Asia. 
Within this limping, sidelined Japan the confidence of the young was further undermined by accumulating environmental deterioration. For example, the country was running out of waste-dumping capacity. Dioxin problems were worsening as more waste was burned. Illegal dumping of waste intensified outside the urban areas where controls were lax. The official reaction? To do nothing, but to excuse the relaxation of standards as they had been higher than in other countries. 
If Japan was becoming an increasingly unpleasant place in which to live, for the young in particular the demographic pressures were the most depressing. Japan was rapidly shifting from becoming the youngest of the industrial economies to the oldest. The older generations were taking action, setting up lobby groups to protect themselves. In 200z03, to pay for pensions, special income taxes were imposed and unemployment benefits were cut. Older workers were being protected in jobs as far as possible, whilst the young were having to be part of a growing ""contingent"" labour force, accepting more part-time and temporary work. 
For the first time in its history Japan experienced significant labour emigration as the young began to depart. The loss prevented Japan, already one of the least ""wired"" countries, from exploiting new technologies. The departure of the young was matched by the exodus of competitive companies. The new products of the IT world were made elsewhere. 
By z020 those Japanese now outside the country tended to conclude: ""It has become a wonderful time to be a global trading firm-not a great time to be in Japan."" 2: Crash and rebirth 
The second scenario, by contrast, is more optimistic. This explores how Japan could make an impressive turn-round, beginning with, perhaps, a 1999 ""bank-holiday crisis"", a turn-round which ends up with Japan firmly established as a respected world leader two decades later. In such circumstances, alongside the United States, Japan could use its advanced technology to ensure that China can ease its food and energy constraints without resorting to a destabilising takeover of the resources of Central Asia or the South China Sea. 
The first building-block of this success story was the willingness to confront the financial crisis of 1999, establishing the momentum for reform by taking Japan out of the grip of anti-reform interest groups. The new accounting self-assessment system for bank assets, introduced in 1997, began to reveal the extent ofthe banks' balance-sheet weakness in 1998. By 1999, after a year of trying to support the banks, the government finally gave up the attempt, overwhelmed by the size of the problem and market pressures. The ensuing collapse of bank share-prices, linked to an accompanying fall in other equity prices and an attempted unloading of cross-shareholdings for self-preservation, precipitated a new financial slump. The yen plummeted and the minister of finance closed banks: doors to stop panicky withdrawals of deposits. 
The rescue package then presented froze 25% of deposits of banks and postalsavings accounts into zo-year zero-coupon government bonds, using the resources to write-off all bad loans. All remaining bank deposits were guaranteed. Massive cuts in bank staffs and the resignation of bank directors followed with the banks' promises of deposit guarantees. The long-term benefit of this traumatic solution was to force a more open relationship between finance and business. 
These actions were followed up in October 1999 by a radical set of administrative reforms, requiring government companies to disclose and write off their hidden losses, a 30% cut in government and bureaucracy costs, extensive tax reform, industrial deregulation and the privatisation of pension funds. Such radicalism triggered a predictable counter-reaction by threatened interest groups but the reforms were endorsed in an election that returned a party by then called the Reformists, thanks to a massive jump in voter turnout, from 50% to 80%. Spurred by the shock of the banking crisis, Japan's previously apathetic people had realised that the momentum for reform had to be sustained. 
The election also saw the younger generations beginning to take more control. Reforms begat reforms, especially as positive results came through: after just five years, the nationalised banks were being returned to private ownership. Critical social reforms were enacted from 2oo8 onwards, for example encouraging more women to work and to marry, to raise fertility. Nor were the needs of the ageing population ignored. Policies to allow people to work longer helped to ease the burden on the pension funds (themselves now in better shape after pension-fund reform). Educational reform made students more flexible to meet the creative challenges of the knowledge economy. Some immigration was encouraged and finally the lifetime employment and pay-by-seniority systems were dismantled. 
Building on these reforms, from 2010 on there was a more conscious effort to improve the environment, giving incentives for pollution-control technologies, for new agricultural technologies, for recycling and for more R&D into the problems of global warming and ozone depletion. The emergent environmentalist culture in Japan gave a boost to ""green"" technologies, led by car firms, who were now able to follow up their early successes in introducing the world's first green cars in the 199os. Research cut sulphur and nitrogen emissions drastically. Breakthroughs cut dioxins, thereby helping to combat the fall in the fertility rate. Many of these new technologies also generated profitable new business in China's booming market. 
It was indeed China which provided the arena in which Japan's advances paid off. The demand for grain in China, which needed to feed a further 12m people every year, and its massive rise in energy consumption, had encouraged the Chinese government to cast its eyes westwards, to the resources of Central Asia. Tensions rose as America and Russia took steps to block China's moves to take over these resources. Japan, bound to peaceful action only by Artide 9 of the constitution, was desperate to prevent conflict in Asia which would damage trade and would destabilise the region profoundly. 
After three years of tension, in 28 the Japanese prime minister proposed a tripartite solution whereby the United States and Japan used their advanced technologies to assist China in improving crop yields and increasing energy efficiency. This event signalled Japan's ability to meet its many challenges. Without the advances pioneered by its new, technologically astute young workforce, conscious of the need to protect the environment, a peaceful solution to the geopolitical tensions of Asia might not have been found. The China solution was the symbol of the success of the new Japan, a nation reborn from the seeds of the tough measures taken to confront structural weaknesses at the turn of the millennium. 3: Hercules departs 
The third scenario is not, in truth, an alternative to the first two. But it describes and elaborates upon the biggest single external shock that could shape Japan during the next two decades. This could occur regardless of which of the first two scenarios comes about; and if it does, it will greatly complicate Japan's situation. 
This shock is the withdrawal of American troops from Asia, which would pose big security dilemmas for Japan. The result, in this scenario, is that in July 2010japan is engaged in an intense debate over whether to amend Article 9 of the constitution, which in effect forbids military action except in self-defence. Japan faced the need, for the first time for 65 years, to look after its own security. 
America's troop withdrawal was driven by a number of circumstances. Within the United States itself, as the economy slowed in 2001-2, the Republican president looked for ways to husband fiscal resources so as to allow a recovery by the 2004 election. At the same time, more Americans were expressing their discomfort with their country's role as world policeman. A war hero, the president was able to use his reputation to take advantage of an opportunity emerging in Asia. 
In Asia the American military presence looked more and more anachronistic as some key issues edged towards some sort of solution. First, as the North Korean regime crumbled in 2002-03 and the two Koreas finally united, the United States agreed to reduce its presence in return for an agreement by China to stay out of the Koreas. In January 2003 the president announced his new policy, redeploying troops from forward positions to Hawaii by 2010, leaving some based in Guam. The Security Treaty with Japan was preserved, the idea being that new military strategies and power-projection capabilities would allow for this troop pullback. Worries about China's size and weight remained, but were at least assuaged by its still-peaceful proprietorship of Hong Kong. At first there was little obvious reaction in Asia. 
But in 2005 China began to test the waters with some subtle but noticeable discrimination against Japanese companies in China, to gauge the strength of a Japan with reduced American support. In 2007 China went further, by suggesting quietly that companies operating in Taiwan might be less than welcome in China. America looked the other way, in stark contrast to the explicit warnings given almost a decade earlier during the Taiwan crisis of 1996. Taiwan realised that accommodation with China was likely to be necessary. By 2008 Japan was in an increasingly difficult position as reality began to sink in. Five separate factions emerged in the debate over Japan's foreign and security policy. Of the five, only the Pacifists held out against a revision of Article 9. 
The Nationalists called for Japan to shake off the whole panoply of its American-based constitution and economic system and to reassert Japan's rightful place in the world-at home to re-establish Japanese values and abroad to resist Chinese imperialism. The Pacifists, in contrast, believed that peace still could be attained through diplomatic means. But while vocal, the Pacifists tended to be disunited and many Japanese saw this approach as being too risky. 
The third faction, the pro-America Conservatives, called for a rebuilding of a strong relationship with the United States in order to facilitate unrestrained co-operation between American and Japanese forces. The fourth, Pan-Asian faction, preferred Japan to try to engage China not to isolate it, and to work towards a Pan-Asian multilateral security framework, involving Japanese forces. 
Finally, the ASE_AN faction (advocating an Association of South-East and Eastern Asian Nations) also favoured a more Asian solution but one where nations of AsEAN and the United Koreas should build a security arrangement to counter the power of China. America was not to be trusted and Japan would need to rebuild its forces. 
Whilst the vote looked as if it would swing in favour of Article 9 revision, whatever the result, the future of foreign policy is uncertain. With American support departing, the very identity of Japan was at stake.

The sum is bigger than a previous record package of February 1994, which amounted to almost 15 trillion. Enough, surely, to get Japan's moribund economy moving again? 
The LDP, however, was tantalisingly vague about what the package consists of, and exactly how much new money it wants the government to spend. On past evidence, the real level of extra spending will fall far short of the headline figure. There will be more cash for developing infrastructure, and some for minor tax cuts. But much of the rest will probably involve bringing forward spending that was already allocated, or such things as pumping money into the stockmarket and buying land. This will not directly stimulate much demand. In all, perhaps only between 5 trillion to 7 trillion of the total will have a more immediate effect on growth. Along with the vagueness of the plan, this is why financial markets did not react to it with much glee. 
The problem is not just the amount of money involved, but how it is spent. Like most economists and Japanese opposition leaders, American officials have been prodding the Japanese government to cut taxes rather than spend more on public works. Of the Y75 trillion of fiscal packages announced over the past five years, some Y38 trillion was spent on public investment in one form or another. Yet even that gave the economy only the briefest of boosts. 
Big and lasting tax cuts, reckon most economists, would be far more effective. Unfortunately, such tax cuts would have to be financed by issuing lots of government deficit-financing bonds. But last November the government pushed through a law that gradually reduces the issuance of such bonds to zero by 2003. 
Until now, the LDP has been staunchly opposed to changing the law. But now there are some signs that the party's leaders-though not the powerful finance ministry-appear to be shifting a bit. In announcing the package, the party indicated it would think about changing the tax system. Koichi Kato, the LDP's secretary general and its number two, said that tax cuts would be considered by a reform panel. 
Yet there remain good reasons to suspect that the LDP will continue to stall on tax cuts. The main reason is that an election for the House of Councillors,Japan's upper house, is due in July. Though not as important as the lower house, the upper house can cause frustrating delays and dilute policy. The LDP is keen to regain the majority it lost in the upper house in 1989. This would allow it to ditch from the coalition government two smaller parties on which it presently has to rely on for support. With opposition parties in a shambles, the LDP reckons that it now has a chance to do that. 
Where do tax cuts fit into this? For a start, it was the prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was responsible for pushing through the fiscal reform law which makes it difficult to fund tax cuts. An aboutturn at this stage might require his resignation. With no other obvious leaders, that is the last thing that the LDP wants. 
Tax cuts are also a blunt instrument. Public works, however, can be focused on specific districts where there is a need to impress voters. This does not mean the LDP will avoid tax cuts at all costs. The Japanese are under plenty of pressure from the United States, among others, to do something meaningful to stimulate the economy. But firm spending plans cannot be finalised until the regular budget is agreed. This has passed the lower house but will be delayed by the upper house. That will give the LDP time to reconsider its reluctance to cut taxes before the G7 summit in Britain in May. But the chances are that politics will still intervene, and the economy continue to suffer. Ultimately, of course, so too will the popularity of the LDP: a thriving economy was the rock on which its fortunes were based.

Japan's economy has been hammered first by an increase in sales tax last year which choked consumer spending, and then by a collapse in exports to the cash-strapped East Asian economies. (Japan's exports to the region are two and a half times larger than America's or Europe's as a share of GDP.) In the three months to February, Japan's industrial production fell by an annualised 6% compared with the previous three months, and its GDP is expected to shrink in 1998 for the first time in more than two decades. As a result, more banks are likely to fail, and many large debt-laden Japanese firms are also likely to go bust (see page 15-17). As unemployment rises, worried consumers will save even more and spend even less. 
Norio Ohga, the chairman of Sony, has warned that the economy is on the brink of a collapse that could cause a world-wide recession. He likened Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to Herbert Hoover, America's president at the onset of the Great Depression, for his failure to spur Japan's economy. The Y16 trillion ($12o billion) stimulus package announced by the government at the end of last month sounded impressive, but only about half of this is likely to be new money. The government could yet prevent a collapse in output by introducing big income-tax cuts to revive consumer and business confidence, but policymaking remains paralysed. Japan's recession could turn out to be even worse than advocates of creative destruction deem necessary.

Suppose that happens, and Japan crashes. How worried should the rest of the world be? The OECD in its new Economic Outlook forecasts that America's economy will slow this year, mainly because of weaker growth in exports, especially to Asia, but it still expects growth of 2.7%-healthy by any standards. The European Union is forecast to grow at the same pace. But these forecasts assume that Japan's GDP falls by a modest o.3%. What if Japan sinks deeper? 
Even a worse Japanese recession need not scupper the world economy. One reason is that Japan, large as it is, accounts for only 13% of global GDP. Japan's weight in world trade-the main channel through which a recession would spread abroad-is also surprisingly modest. America's exports to Japan account for only 1% of its GDP, those of countries in the European Union only o.5% of GDP. And, contrary to popular wisdom, imports from Japan account for only 12% of GDP in each case. 
Moreover, a deeper Japanese recession would not be qualitatively very different, so far as Europe and America are concerned, from the experience of the past six years. Since 1992 Japan's growth has averaged only 1.3% a year, or more than a percentage point less than its long-term underlying rate of, say, 212%. This is equivalent to a total drop in output, relative to potential, of 7%. In other words, unlike the rest of East Asia, Japan has acted as a brake on the world economy throughout the 199os. For outsiders, a worse recession there would merely be more of the same. Its effects would be detectable elsewhere (as they have been already) but not devastating. 
A further reason to be sanguine is that economic cycles are currently more out of kilter than for several decades. As Asia slumps, America and Britain have been booming, and economies in continental Europe and Latin America are picking up speed. As a result, strong economies can offset the impact of a downturn in Asia-which is better than everybody spinning downwards together. Weaker demand in Japan and the rest of Asia has actually served a useful purpose, preventing the American economy, which had been growing too fast, from overheating. America's growing trade deficit is a safety valve: it has prevented domestic demand from spilling over into inflation. The success of America and Europe in trimming budget deficits and curbing inflation also means that policymakers have room to cut interest rates or taxes to keep their economies healthy, should Japan's recession prove severe. 
So much for the direct effect on the other rich economies of a severe Japanese recession. But two possible indirect effects are more worrying-a rise in protectionism as Japanese exports rise. and the risk of a stockmarket crash. 
America's trade deficit is likely to widen sharply as a result of problems in Japan and the rest of Asia. If this encourages America to raise trade barriers and others to retaliate, a global recession may follow. But the biggest risk to America, and hence to the world economy, lies on Wall Street. It looks dangerously overvalued, yet share prices continue to climb. Some unexpectedly bad news from Japan might just be the event that brings investors back to reality and so causes a crash. Awkwardly, America's economy is more vulnerable to a drop in share prices than ever before. Almost twice as many Americans hold shares today (either directly or through mutual funds or pension plans) as in the mid-t98os. A fall in share prices will make a much bigger dent in the economy. 
If America and Europe do stumble, politicians will be quick to blame the Japanese. But on present evidence the real blame in that event is more likely to lie either with trade-bashing politicians or with the Federal Reserve, which failed to raise interest rates last year to deflate the stockmarket bubble. Foreigners are right to urge Japan to revive its economy, but they will have mainly themselves to blame if Japan's woes spread to their own.

THE invisible hand is giving japan an almighty whack. First to feel the pain were the country's banks. Having lent immoderately large sums to just about anyone that wanted the money, they have been on the ropes ever since the collapse of stock and land prices earlier this decade. But another wave of casualties is coming, this time in the non-financial parts of Japan's ailing economy. The implications for output and jobs are serious, more so than many Japanese yet understand. 
Up to now the country has been chiefly preoccupied with the unfolding financial mess, and this has indeed been bad enough. Last November the country narrowly avoided an outright collapse of confidence in its financial system. Such problems are almost certain to resurface-but it is ever more clear that the problems go wider. Now that the country's non-financial companies are in deep trouble too, Japan may be about to enter a vicious circle in which worries about the parlous state of its banks and its non-financial firms amplify each other. 
The news gets worse by the day. On April 3rd, Moody's, a credit-rating agency, said in effect that it was unsure whether Japan deserved its top credit rating. For a country that runs a huge current-account surplus and is by far the world's biggest creditor nation, this seems, at first sight, startling. But Moody's was only saying what many already know: Japan's economy is in a horrible state. 
Anxious consumers are still curbing their spending; industrial production fell by 3.3% in February compared with the previous month; and the latest tankan survey of business confidence by the Bank of Japan, echoing a clutch of other surveys, was remorselessly awful. Corporate profits are slumping. Alex Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, expects manufacturing profits to fall by 30% during the current financial year and those of non-manufacturers by 20%, though he says his forecasts may be too optimistic. The country's hugely bloated construction industry, which employs 11% of the workforce, is in the deepest mess; but look around Japan's corporate landscape and there is scarcely a bright spot to be seen. 
Understandably, other countries are increasingly worried about the dismal condition of the rich world's second-biggest economy. At a meeting in London between Asian and European leaders last weekend, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese prime minister, was roundly chided for failing to revive his country's economy. Defensive in London, on returning to Tokyo he admitted that Japan faced its biggest economic crisis since 1945. Hints that the government will announce tax cuts and/or big new increases in public spending have been coming thick and fast. 
Looser fiscal policy would give the economy a badly needed short-term boost, but would fail to deal with a variety of deeper problems. In important respects, the country's problems are structural rather than cyclical. Simply stated, there are too many big, inefficient companies in almost every part of the economy. Many have survived, burning shareholders' cash, thanks to a financial system that has long tolerated-even encouraged-over-investment and over-borrowing in sectors that were never going to earn more than derisory returns. More recently they have been helped by the government's willingness to spend lots of money stoking demand, by the country's healthy exports, and by the Bank of Japan's super-loose monetary policy. That the economy has failed to respond shows how deep-seated the illness really is. Invest and die 
The problems for japanese companies start and stop with the huge amount that they have invested over the years with little thought of profitability. At the peak, taking advantage of a surging stockmarket to raise cheap equity-linked debt, businesses invested almost 20% of GDP in early 199o. In America, it was about half that. Bizarrely, the investment did not stop when the bubble burst: companies have taken advantage of record-low interest rates to invest even more. Encouraged by deregulation in retailing, for instance, retailers have increased their floor space by half since 199o. 
Apart from lots of unneeded factories and a surfeit of clothes shops, the result is a mountain of debt. Corporate sales have doubled since 198o but debts have tripled. Taken as a whole, the manufacturing sector is not too indebted, but the debt-equity ratio for non-manufacturing companies (debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds, an inverse measure of a company's financial strength) is 159%, high by any standards. 
For the past few years, these debts have been manageable-thanks largely to the Bank of Japan's lax monetary policy. Indeed, some 60% of the increase in overall company profits in the recovery that has just ended came from lower interest costs. 
Official interest rates are still low, but new borrowing is nonetheless more expensive: banks have started to raise the price of their loans to reflect the greater risk of bankruptcy. Companies are getting into deeper trouble because the economy is on the skids. And the implicit guarantee of a company's debts given by its main bank is worth much less than it used to be, because the banks themselves are in a mess. In addition to all the bad loans that they had already amassed, recession and the financial crisis in Asia are causing their good loan books to deteriorate rapidly. 
Quite how much more companies are having to pay is hard to gauge-banks keep this information to themselves. But a good idea can be gleaned from the rates at which companies are prepared, in ever increasing numbers, to borrow in the bond markets. Yields have shot up, particularly since Yamaichi, then Japan's fourth-largest stockbroker, and Hokkaido Takushoku, a big commercial bank, went bust last November. Though the Bank of Japan flooded the financial system with liquidity to stave off a systemic collapse, and the government has promised squillions of yen to shore up troubled banks, those concerns have not gone away. 
Increased interest charges have come at a time when operating profits are falling fast. For manufacturers' profits, the rate of capacity utilisation is crucial: the lower it is, the higher the unit costs of every widget they make. Weak demand means that output and operating rates are falling sharply. Since the ratio of shipments-to-stocks is still at a ten-year high, firms will have to cut output-and prices-still more. 
Bad enough, to be sure-but these averages lump together the good and the bad, and the bad is turning very ugly. Many companies are in danger of going bust. The non-manufacturing sector is in the weakest state. Having spent so much on building shops which consumers are failing to patronise, many retailers are in a bad way. Daiei, the biggest and most expansive, is also the worst off. 
Yet, for sheer awfulness, construction firms are in a league of their own, despite feeding at the trough of public works. The leading companies-Shimizu, Taisei and Obayashi-are merely revising profits forecasts downwards (or declaring losses) as they write off overdue receivables, revalue or even sell off their land, slim their businesses and fire workers. But some secondtier outfits (big firms, still) are teetering on the edge. Like Tada and Tokai Kogyo, which failed last year, most are deeply in hock to a single bank rather than to a handful of lenders. Kumagai Gumi is vulnerable, but Sumitomo Bank has promised to stand by it as it restructures. The fate of companies such as Fujita, JDC, Sato Kogyo, Aoki and Daikyo is in the hands of their banks. 
Lenders were keen to keep them afloat until the end of their financial year, for fear of turning more of the loans on their books bad. But a month into the new financial year another series of construction bankruptcies-bigger and scarier than last autumn's-is looming, as stronger banks choose to pull the plug on firms with no prospect of recovery. 
Driven to destruction 
Much of Japan's manufacturing industry is struggling too. Of the big car companies, for example, Toyota and Honda stand as remarkable exceptions-they have probably just earned record profits. But the othersMitsubishi Motors, Nissan and Mazdaare on their knees. Nissan may have just scraped a profit, but it has been in trouble for years. Both Mazda and Mitsubishi are losing money; their debts are huge. The up shot is that the car industry as a whole is making enough (in operating and investment income added together) to cover its interest costs six times over, but only because Toyota and Honda are doing very well; Mazda's interest cover is only 1.7, and Mitsubishi's is o.9 (see chart). 
Weak sales of computers and domestic appliances at home coupled with tumbling prices of DRAM memory chips abroad have clobbered Japan's big electrical groups. All three of the country's electrical conglomerates-Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric-have seen mounting losses in the brutally competitive DR,AM market. This is the year that the three of them will have to focus ruthlessly-as Sony has done-on a handful of high-growth sectors if they are to survive. None is ""too big to fail"" but the most vulnerable is clearly Mitsubishi Electric. It lost V70 billion ($57om) last year. 
The smokestack manufacturers, particularly the steel companies, are in a dreadful hole. Though Nippon Steel, in particular, has restructured fairly diligently, all have been dealt a severe blow by falling demand for their high-quality steel from the car and electronics industries at home and from buyers elsewhere in Asia, themselves reeling under their own troubles. Meanwhile their arch rival, South Korea's Posco, has been given a big competitive boost by the devaluation of the won. The stockmarket fears that two at leastKobe Steel and NKK-may fail to survive. 
Oil companies are in a similar bind. They pump almost no oil out of the ground and rely for their profits on refining and distributing the stuff. They are bad at both. Long protected by regulation, they have failed to keep their costs under control. On top of that, deregulation-which is allowing more imports of petroleum products and, from April ist, the introduction of selfservice petrol stations-is causing pain. So dearly were banks and financial markets going to charge the oil companies for new borrowing that in March the government had to step in to lend them more cash. The markets are most worried about the privately owned Idemitsu Kosan and two other big firms: Cosmo and Mitsubishi Oil. 
Japan's experiences are salutary for those who think that investment should be encouraged at all costs, or that bureaucrats are better at allocating resources than markets. Some pundits used to claim that Japanese companies could build long-term profitability-in contrast to American companies, ever at the mercy of quarterly resuits. So much for that theory. 
Japanese companies have never cared much about profitability, long-term or anyterm. At 4.4%, the return on equity of the non-financial companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is dreadful by any standards, and has been falling for years. Many companies claim now that they want to increase returns, but they have done almost nothing that involves any pain (notably, sacking people). The chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan's largest maker of heavy machinery, probably spoke for many company bosses when he said recently that ""profit maximisation is inappropriate for manufacturing industry"". Increasing market share and keeping people employed has always been, and remains, the higher priority. 
Markets and messages 
Japanese companies concentrated on investment not profits because the financial system and the tax regime encouraged them to do just that. Efficient capital markets have never been allowed to develop. Markets send embarrassing messages about how, where and at what price capital should be allocated-best to ignore them, Japan used to think. Though the Tokyo Stock Exchange looks like a normal stockmarket, it isn't. Above all, it is not a market in corporate control. Cross-shareholdings have made that almost impossible. Unprofitable companies, the ones that squander capital, cannot be taken over. 
The main suppliers of capital, the banks, have also been remarkably unconcerned that their money be put to good use. Banks were big shareholders in the companies they lent to; and they did not worry (as banks do in other countries) that their big debtors might go bust. A company's main bank implicitly guaranteed its debts. Lending was collateralised, mainly by land. Bankruptcies among big firms were rare. 
The corporate tax system must also shoulder some of the blame. Companies' effective tax rate-especially for smaller ones, with little scope for sheltering their profits-hovers at just over 50% in Japan, compared with 41% in America. Trying to shield profits from so large a tax bite has led to all manner of corporate abuses. One of the worst has been the urge by management to depreciate assets as fast as possible irrespective of their useful life. 
The results of all this-bad investment on a breathtaking scale-are only now becoming plain. How much worse might things get? Consumer sentiment was hit hard enough by the collapse of middling companies. The failure of a big one would almost certainly knock it for six. That would put still further pressure on companies to slash output and prices in order to get rid of the mountains of unsold goods now cluttering stores and showrooms. 
Such a failure is becoming more likely thanks to a number of changes about to be introduced. The first is in Japanese accounting, which is about to become more revealing. Like America, Japan is moving towards adopting International Accounting Standards (LAs). Starting next April,Japanese companies will have to produce full consolidated accounts-something provided now by only a few of the healthiest. 
At present Japanese accounts are, to a greater extent than elsewhere, bottom-up affairs: firms decide what profit they want to report and then fill in the numbers accordingly. Losses that threaten the final figure can be covered by cashing hidden reserves; embarrassing surpluses (rare at the best of times) can be allocated to ""research and development"". In a country where shareholders are an afterthought, accounting methods have evolved to render profit, or lack of it, somewhat meaningless. 
One of the worst aspects of Japanese accounts is their treatment of subsidiaries. These are left off the parent company's accounts if its shareholding is less than 50%. As long as they own less than that, parent companies in Japan can hide ugly things from tax inspectors. Next year's introduction of consolidated accounting will force companies to take on to their books subsidiaries in which they have effective control, even though they may have only a minority stake. At the same time, they will have to adopt marked-to-market valuations for all their tradable securities, putting an end to the hidden-reserves era of corporate accounting. Together, these changes will force companies to reveal unpleasant truths. 
The second change is that, in return for agreeing to a reduction in the corporate tax rate, the Ministry of Finance is closing a number of loopholes. One of these is likely to be the ""completion method"" of accounting used by construction firms to put off paying their taxes. Japanese builders defer the recognition of profits until a construction project is completed, expensing everything up front. They pay their taxes eventually, but they gain in the meantime from an inflated cashflow. Under the coming reforms, construction firms will have to match their expenses and revenues more closely. That will put even greater strain on their already depleted resources. 
But the biggest time-bomb hidden in Japanese accounts is the horrifying amount of unfunded pension obligations that have been piling up and now threaten to topple many firms. This is happening just as the greying of Japan's population gathers pace. According to Timothy Marable, an analyst at UBS Securities in Tokyo, the pension-liability figure that (sometimes) appears in the company's accounts is the legal minimum, not the actuarial liability. In a study of 26 blue-chip Japanese firms which do their accounts the American way, Mr Marable found that, on average, the assets in their pension funds covered only 6o% of the projected benefits. Making matters worse, some of the firms had chosen implausible discount rates (with the effect of reducing their estimated liabilities). 
The most vulnerable was Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance, which had the lowest ratio of assets to liabilities (o.4) and had used the highest discount rate (5.5%) of the group. Those with below-average solvency ratios included household names such as Komatsu, Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsui, Toshiba, Sony and Fuji Photo. Only the giant supermarket operator, Ito-Yokado, came close to having a fully-funded pension plan. And note that this is the situation among companies that have already adopted proper accounting methods. These are unlikely to be the worst cases. 
The going rate 
Pressure to change is sure to mount further. No longer able to rely on tame banks for cheap capital, companies will have to turn increasingly to the capital markets. But investors-Japanese and foreign-will require higher returns and greater transparency if they are to invest. Japan is turning from an economy where capital is abnormally cheap into one where it costs what financial markets dictate. 
Many companies simply cannot afford to pay that rate, and will go to the wall. Over the next few years, bankruptcy rates, already at an all-time high, will climb higher still. Unemployment could easily double from today's 3.6%. 
To survive, companies will have to do the unthinkable. They will have to merge. They will have to sack surplus workers. They may have to seek salvation-could it really come to this?-in the arms of foreign firms. Right now, corporate Japan and the Japanese government would both find it wholly unacceptable for, say, Volkswagen to acquire Nissan, or General Electric to buy Toshiba. After a string of dramatic failures, such acquisitions may come to be seen as necessary and even desirable. That would mark the final demise of the Japan Inc way of doing business.

Yields have shot up , particularly since Yamaichi , then Japan 's fourth - largest stockbroker , and Hokkaido Takushoku , a big commercial bank , went bust last November . Though the Bank of Japan flooded the financial system with liquidity to stave off a systemic collapse , and the government has promised squillions of yen to shore up troubled banks , those concerns have not gone away . 
 Increased interest charges have come at a time when operating profits are falling fast . For manufacturers ' profits , the rate of capacity utilisation is crucial : the lower it is , the higher the unit costs of every widget they make . Weak demand means that output and operating rates are falling sharply . Since the ratio of shipments - to - stocks is still at a ten - year high , firms will have to cut output - and prices - still more . 
 Bad enough , to be sure - but these averages lump together the good and the bad , and the bad is turning very ugly . Many companies are in danger of going bust . The non - manufacturing sector is in the weakest state . Having spent so much on building shops which consumers are failing to patronise , many retailers are in a bad way . Daiei , the biggest and most expansive , is also the worst off . 
 Yet , for sheer awfulness , construction firms are in a league of their own , despite feeding at the trough of public works . The leading companies - Shimizu , Taisei and Obayashi - are merely revising profits forecasts downwards ( or declaring losses ) as they write off overdue receivables , revalue or even sell off their land , slim their businesses and fire workers . But some secondtier outfits ( big firms , still ) are teetering on the edge . Like Tada and Tokai Kogyo , which failed last year , most are deeply in hock to a single bank rather than to a handful of lenders . Kumagai Gumi is vulnerable , but Sumitomo Bank has promised to stand by it as it restructures . The fate of companies such as Fujita , JDC , Sato Kogyo , Aoki and Daikyo is in the hands of their banks . 
 Lenders were keen to keep them afloat until the end of their financial year , for fear of turning more of the loans on their books bad . But a month into the new financial year another series of construction bankruptcies - bigger and scarier than last autumn's - is looming , as stronger banks choose to pull the plug on firms with no prospect of recovery . 
 Driven to destruction 
 Much of Japan 's manufacturing industry is struggling too . Of the big car companies , for example , Toyota and Honda stand as remarkable exceptions - they have probably just earned record profits . But the othersMitsubishi Motors , Nissan and Mazdaare on their knees . Nissan may have just scraped a profit , but it has been in trouble for years . Both Mazda and Mitsubishi are losing money ; their debts are huge . The up shot is that the car industry as a whole is making enough ( in operating and investment income added together ) to cover its interest costs six times over , but only because Toyota and Honda are doing very well ; Mazda 's interest cover is only 1.7 , and Mitsubishi 's is o.9 ( see chart ) . 
 Weak sales of computers and domestic appliances at home coupled with tumbling prices of DRAM memory chips abroad have clobbered Japan 's big electrical groups . All three of the country 's electrical conglomerates - Hitachi , Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric - have seen mounting losses in the brutally competitive DR , AM market . This is the year that the three of them will have to focus ruthlessly - as Sony has done - on a handful of high - growth sectors if they are to survive . None is "" too big to fail "" but the most vulnerable is clearly Mitsubishi Electric . It lost V70 billion ( $ 57om ) last year . 
 The smokestack manufacturers , particularly the steel companies , are in a dreadful hole . Though Nippon Steel , in particular , has restructured fairly diligently , all have been dealt a severe blow by falling demand for their high - quality steel from the car and electronics industries at home and from buyers elsewhere in Asia , themselves reeling under their own troubles . Meanwhile their arch rival , South Korea 's Posco , has been given a big competitive boost by the devaluation of the won . The stockmarket fears that two at leastKobe Steel and NKK - may fail to survive . 
 Oil companies are in a similar bind . They pump almost no oil out of the ground and rely for their profits on refining and distributing the stuff . They are bad at both . Long protected by regulation , they have failed to keep their costs under control . On top of that , deregulation - which is allowing more imports of petroleum products and , from April ist , the introduction of selfservice petrol stations - is causing pain . So dearly were banks and financial markets going to charge the oil companies for new borrowing that in March the government had to step in to lend them more cash . The markets are most worried about the privately owned Idemitsu Kosan and two other big firms : Cosmo and Mitsubishi Oil . 
 Japan 's experiences are salutary for those who think that investment should be encouraged at all costs , or that bureaucrats are better at allocating resources than markets . Some pundits used to claim that Japanese companies could build long - term profitability - in contrast to American companies , ever at the mercy of quarterly resuits . So much for that theory . 
 Japanese companies have never cared much about profitability , long - term or anyterm . At 4.4 % , the return on equity of the non - financial companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is dreadful by any standards , and has been falling for years . Many companies claim now that they want to increase returns , but they have done almost nothing that involves any pain ( notably , sacking people ) . The chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , Japan 's largest maker of heavy machinery , probably spoke for many company bosses when he said recently that "" profit maximisation is inappropriate for manufacturing industry "" . Increasing market share and keeping people employed has always been , and remains , the higher priority . 
 Markets and messages 
 Japanese companies concentrated on investment not profits because the financial system and the tax regime encouraged them to do just that . Efficient capital markets have never been allowed to develop . Markets send embarrassing messages about how , where and at what price capital should be allocated - best to ignore them , Japan used to think . Though the Tokyo Stock Exchange looks like a normal stockmarket , it is n't . Above all , it is not a market in corporate control . Cross - shareholdings have made that almost impossible . Unprofitable companies , the ones that squander capital , can not be taken over . 
 The main suppliers of capital , the banks , have also been remarkably unconcerned that their money be put to good use . Banks were big shareholders in the companies they lent to ; and they did not worry ( as banks do in other countries ) that their big debtors might go bust . A company 's main bank implicitly guaranteed its debts . Lending was collateralised , mainly by land . Bankruptcies among big firms were rare . 
 The corporate tax system must also shoulder some of the blame . Companies ' effective tax rate - especially for smaller ones , with little scope for sheltering their profits - hovers at just over 50 % in Japan , compared with 41 % in America . Trying to shield profits from so large a tax bite has led to all manner of corporate abuses . One of the worst has been the urge by management to depreciate assets as fast as possible irrespective of their useful life . 
 The results of all this - bad investment on a breathtaking scale - are only now becoming plain . How much worse might things get ? Consumer sentiment was hit hard enough by the collapse of middling companies . The failure of a big one would almost certainly knock it for six . That would put still further pressure on companies to slash output and prices in order to get rid of the mountains of unsold goods now cluttering stores and showrooms . 
 Such a failure is becoming more likely thanks to a number of changes about to be introduced . The first is in Japanese accounting , which is about to become more revealing . Like America , Japan is moving towards adopting International Accounting Standards ( LAs ) . Starting next April , Japanese companies will have to produce full consolidated accounts - something provided now by only a few of the healthiest . 
 At present Japanese accounts are , to a greater extent than elsewhere , bottom - up affairs : firms decide what profit they want to report and then fill in the numbers accordingly . Losses that threaten the final figure can be covered by cashing hidden reserves ; embarrassing surpluses ( rare at the best of times ) can be allocated to "" research and development "" . In a country where shareholders are an afterthought , accounting methods have evolved to render profit , or lack of it , somewhat meaningless . 
 One of the worst aspects of Japanese accounts is their treatment of subsidiaries . These are left off the parent company 's accounts if its shareholding is less than 50 % . As long as they own less than that , parent companies in Japan can hide ugly things from tax inspectors . Next year 's introduction of consolidated accounting will force companies to take on to their books subsidiaries in which they have effective control , even though they may have only a minority stake . At the same time , they will have to adopt marked - to - market valuations for all their tradable securities , putting an end to the hidden - reserves era of corporate accounting . Together , these changes will force companies to reveal unpleasant truths . 
 The second change is that , in return for agreeing to a reduction in the corporate tax rate , the Ministry of Finance is closing a number of loopholes . One of these is likely to be the "" completion method "" of accounting used by construction firms to put off paying their taxes . Japanese builders defer the recognition of profits until a construction project is completed , expensing everything up front . They pay their taxes eventually , but they gain in the meantime from an inflated cashflow . Under the coming reforms , construction firms will have to match their expenses and revenues more closely . That will put even greater strain on their already depleted resources . 
 But the biggest time - bomb hidden in Japanese accounts is the horrifying amount of unfunded pension obligations that have been piling up and now threaten to topple many firms . This is happening just as the greying of Japan 's population gathers pace . According to Timothy Marable , an analyst at UBS Securities in Tokyo , the pension - liability figure that ( sometimes ) appears in the company 's accounts is the legal minimum , not the actuarial liability . In a study of 26 blue - chip Japanese firms which do their accounts the American way , Mr Marable found that , on average , the assets in their pension funds covered only 6o% of the projected benefits . Making matters worse , some of the firms had chosen implausible discount rates ( with the effect of reducing their estimated liabilities ) . 
 The most vulnerable was Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance , which had the lowest ratio of assets to liabilities ( o.4 ) and had used the highest discount rate ( 5.5 % ) of the group . Those with below - average solvency ratios included household names such as Komatsu , Mitsubishi Electric , Mitsui , Toshiba , Sony and Fuji Photo . Only the giant supermarket operator , Ito - Yokado , came close to having a fully - funded pension plan . And note that this is the situation among companies that have already adopted proper accounting methods . These are unlikely to be the worst cases . 
 The going rate 
 Pressure to change is sure to mount further . No longer able to rely on tame banks for cheap capital , companies will have to turn increasingly to the capital markets . But investors - Japanese and foreign - will require higher returns and greater transparency if they are to invest . Japan is turning from an economy where capital is abnormally cheap into one where it costs what financial markets dictate . 
 Many companies simply can not afford to pay that rate , and will go to the wall . Over the next few years , bankruptcy rates , already at an all - time high , will climb higher still . Unemployment could easily double from today 's 3.6 % . 
 To survive , companies will have to do the unthinkable . They will have to merge . They will have to sack surplus workers . They may have to seek salvation - could it really come to this?-in the arms of foreign firms . Right now , corporate Japan and the Japanese government would both find it wholly unacceptable for , say , Volkswagen to acquire Nissan , or General Electric to buy Toshiba . After a string of dramatic failures , such acquisitions may come to be seen as necessary and even desirable . That would mark the final demise of the Japan Inc way of doing business .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,"Ryutaro Hashimoto , the Japanese prime minister ,",3,True

DOOR Ryutaro Hashimoto. Japan's prime minister must feel that the world is against him. Under increasing pressure to resuscitate his country's moribund economy, he announced a stimulus last month worth some i6 trillion ($124 billion) But it lacked details, not least about how much would be new money and what it would be spent on: public works or, what most economists and foreigners would prefer, tax cuts. This month Mr Hashimoto said the real extra money would amount to some lo trillion-about 2% of GDP-and would include some V4 trillion in income-tax cuts. People are still unhappy. 
Robert Rubin America's treasu secretary, is one of them. He says more steps will be needed. On April 13th, the IMF'S chief economist, Michael Mussa, added to the gloom by predicting that Japan's economy would still struggle to grow at all this year. As if in confirmation, the Bank of Japan released its bleakest economic assessment yet. Growth in net exports, the economy's main support, had slowed, it said. And all other indicators, including consumption, spending on new houses, industrial production, employment and incomes, were weak. So worries that Japan was not doing enough to boost its economy continued to exercise the minds of those attending the G7 finance ministers' meeting on April i6th in Washington. But what can the Japanese government do to get companies to invest and consumers to start spending? 
Since it accounts for nearly 60% of GDP, consumption could be a mighty engine of growth. But Japanese consumers-no matter what a brief stroll in Tokyo's Ginza shopping district may suggest-are saving more and spending less. In March, sales at department stores, for instance, fell by 21% compared with the previous year. Admittedly, in the previous March shoppers had been out in force to beat a new consumption tax. But even when that is taken into account, households are still spending less than a year ago. 
The main reason is that most Japanese are justifiably worried about losing their jobs. In the past, rather than being laid off, surplus workers in Japan have tended to be kept on in redundant jobs. That can continue only for as long as the company survives. Nowadays, with big debts and dismal profits, increasing numbers of Japanese companies are going bust. In the year to the end of March a record 17,500 went bankrupt, according to Tokyo Shoko, a research firm. It expects a new record to be set this year. Worse still, the number of bankruptcies now exceeds the number of firms starting up. 
Small wonder that the unemployment rate has crept up to 3.6%, another record, and is likely to rise further. And the safety net is flimsy: those who lose their jobs can expect only about half their final total pay, and then only for 90 to 300 days, depending on their length of service. 
Even those still in work are finding the value of their wages falling. In 1997, total wages (which include bonuses and overtime) rose by 1.7%. With profits declining, companies are cutting back on overtime (which represents about lO% of total wages) and bonuses (about a quarter). In February, wages shrank by 2% after adjustment for inflation. This worries householders with a mortgage. Despite Japan's low interest rates, mortgages already eat up some 8% of personal disposable income. 
Then there is the worry about savings. In theory, with a monetary policy as loose as Japan's and interest rates close to zero, people should be easily encouraged to spend. But many know they must rely on their savings for retirement, not least be cause on present trends there will not be enough in the public kitty to provide today's workers with pensions. 
The government could, of course, cut income taxes to put more money into people's pockets. In February, temporary income-tax cuts worth some Y2 trillion were brought in. Yet consumption still fell. Mr Hashimoto now proposes another Yz trillion of cuts for this year, and suggests that this February's ""temporary"" cut is continued next year. As much of the extra money from previous temporary tax cuts was saved and not spent, the same thing is expected to happen again. The cuts might be more effective if they were made permanent, as Mr Rubin and others have suggested. But the evidence is unclear. 
Perhaps cutting Japan's high corporate taxes would work better, allowing firms to make bigger profits and thus preserve or create jobs. The problem is that the tax base is narrow: two-thirds of Japanese companies pay no taxes at all. In return for a dramatic cut in corporate taxes, the Ministry of Finance would probably insist on broadening the tax base. That would be politically awkward: it would hit small and mediumsized companies, which make generous contributions to the ruling party. 
So that leaves yet more spending on public works. It would give Japan's economy a short-term boost, but when the money was finished the economy would again run out of steam. Perhaps the government should accept the inevitable-a recession. That may be the only thing to jolt the Japanese economy enough to make the government and companies tackle the spring clean that is so desperately needed.

JUST when Ryutaro Hashimoto's popularity was expected to pick up, it has plunged even further. The record 16.6 trillion ($127 billion) fiscal package that he announced on April 24th was supposed to get the economy moving and show an anxious public that the Japanese prime minister at last had matters firmly under control. Instead of Japan sliding into its worst recession since the second world war, Mr Hashimoto's tax cuts and public-spending plans would help the economy grow by 2% or so this year. A grateful electorate would then hand his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) the majority it seeks in the upper-house election on July 12th. After that, Mr Hashimoto would be left in peace until September 1999, when his second two-year term in office expires. 
Unfortunately, no one seems to have read the prime minister's script. After a brief flurry of interest on the day the rescue package was announced, the stockmarket headed down once more-implying that it had seen the future and was not impressed. The voters likewise have been unmoved. In opinion polls taken after the announcement, Mr Hashimoto's approval rating has fallen still further. In the latest survey, only 23% of those interviewed approved of the prime ministers performance, while 50% held him personally responsible for the economic fiasco that is gripping Japan. Mr Hashimoto now seems well into the crisis zone that caused Tomiichi Murayama, the previous prime minister, to resign in December 1995. 
Of the three main reasons that explain why Mr Hashimoto has been able to remain in office, two no longer exist and one may not do so for much longer. First, the divisions within the opposition are at last being patched over. The Democratic Party, formed 18 months ago by Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan, swallowed up three more smaller parties on April 27th. The centrist party under Mr Kan's unexpectedly sure grip now has 93 members in the soo-seat lower house and 38 in the 256-seat upper house (half of whom will come up for reelection in July). 
As the largest opposition group in the Diet (parliament), Mr Kan and his colleagues have been trying to persuade the other opposition parties-including Ichiro Ozawa's dwindling New Frontier Party, the small but influential New Peace Party and even the Communists-to throw their weight behind an effort to topple the government. For the first time in ages, there is talk of a no-confidence motion being mounted by a united opposition. At the moment, it is just talk. Between them, the opposition parties still cannot muster enough votes in the lower house-unless, of course, some dissenters from the LDP were to vote with them. 
There lies the second reason for Mr Hashimoto's new precariousness. In the present economic circumstances, several of the prime minister's critics from within his own party might well cross the floor-or, worse, mount a palace revolution to wrest away the party leadership. The right-wingers within the LDP-who have long wanted to form an alliance with ultra-conservatives from the New Frontier Party and welcome the belligerent Mr Ozawa back into the fold-have been outsmarted by Mr Hashimoto's henchmen. Meanwhile, the LDP has maintained a semblance of unity because the party elders have deemed that there is no serious alternative to Mr Hashimoto for the time being. 
Nevertheless, names are being mentioned. The ruling party's 20- odd prominent right-wingers have dropped calls to replace Mr Hashimoto with one of their own. Instead, they are backing the middle-of-theroad foreign minister, Keizo Obuchi. As the boss of one of the bigger factions within the LDP, the amiable Mr Obuchi is widely seen as a useful compromise candidate for the party presidency-which carries with it the job of prime minister. His main disadvantage is that he represents the businessas-usual brand of LDP politics that does not go down well with the electorate these days. 
More intriguing is the reemergence of Yohei Kono. As party president, Mr Kono could easily have claimed the prime ministership for himself in the coalition government that the LDP formed in 1994 with two minor opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party and the New Party Sakigake. However, Mr Kono stood down in favour of Mr Murayama, the leader then of the Social Democrats, to ensure the coalition's stability. That act of self-sacrifice has earned Mr Kono respect from both the LDP and the public at large. Mr Kono would make a popular leader. 
But, at least in public, Mr Hashimoto is showing no jitters. He was all smiles when Madeleine Albright, the American secretary of state, dropped in this week on her way to Beijing (where she had talks with Chinese leaders about President Clinton's proposed visit in June. Mrs Albright gave her embattled ally a figurative slap on the back, praising Japan for its loyalty and bravery. And, it has to be said, Mr Hashimoto continues to hope for a big enough victory in the upper-house election for the LDP to regain its traditional majority in both houses. 
The possibility of such a victory in July is the third factor that has been protecting the prime minister-and may not do so much longer. Many party stalwarts are convinced that their troubles began when they lost control of the upper house during the Recruit ""shares-for-favours"" scandal in 1989. The crushing defeat by the Social Democratic Party, headed at the time (as it is once more) by Takako Doi, was the LDP'S biggest electoral upset in 34 years. 
But the LDP leaders are now pondering whether Mr Hashimoto will be more of a liability than an asset in the July election. To be able to claim victory, Mr Hashimoto will have to win at least a simple majority (64) of the 126 seats up for grabs. But that would not be enough for the LDP to regain its overall majority in the upper house. To do so, it would need at least 69 seats-a number it has not won in ages. With the economy worsening and unemployment becoming uglier by the month, Mr Kono must be looking a better bet all round. ","Dollars by the billion may not be enough to save Ryutaro Hashimoto

If the prospects of the crumbling construction industry are anything to go by, they will look modest in a year's time. 
Japan's 50 or so building contractors support a network of 560,000 small builders who, between them, employ 6.8m workers.

Since then, the government has tried to prop the sector up-at least until the election on July 12th. After that, construction firms cannot expect much support. 
Last year's financial results, now being published, show how deep the industry's troubles are. Between them, Japan's five biggest builders-Taisei, Kajima, Shimizu, Obayashi and Kumagai Gumi-have been forced to write off or make special provisions for some 88o billion ($6.4 billion) of extraordinary losses (see table). 
For the time being, Japan's big five can afford these losses. But many of the rest of the country's general contractors cannot. Some are being kept alive by their bankswhich have been asked by the government to keep their life-support systems switched on until after July. Having been handed public money by the government to help them deal with their own bad loans, the banks have little choice at the moment but to return the favour. 
But all bets are off after the election.

Most still have huge problems trying to get paid for projects they have completed. When Shimizu recently cleaned up its books, it wrote off all its uncollected accounts for orders completed in the year to March. But few will be able to take such sweeping steps. Overdue loans were only 25% of Shimizu's total receivables on completed projects. A number of Japanese contractors have accounts overdue by a year running at twice that rate.

THE great paradox of Japanese politics is that the more the government's popularity declines, the better the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) does in local elections. Support for Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, and his cabinet has slumped to 27% from 45% a year ago, while the proportion of Japanese who disapprove of their government has doubled to more than half. Yet the LDP's stunning victory in the Kumamoto prefecture on June 14th marked its sixth straight success in lower-house by-elections. 
The LDP should have done badly in Kumamoto, normally a stronghold for the opposition. Only days earlier, a noisy and ultimately unsuccessful-no-confidence motion had been introduced in the Diet (parliament) by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and other members of the opposition. Yet even that did not prevent the LDP'S candidate, Eiichi Iwashita, from snatching victory. Against all the odds, the LDP now seems set for a handsome victory in the upper-house election on July 12th. It was not what the pundits were predicting even a month ago, and it has important implications for Japan's ability to get to grips with its economic crisis. 
As the present Diet session was drawing to a close on June 18th, Mr Hashimoto could breathe a little easier. With no new corruption scandals to grab the headlines and stir voters from their apathy, his fortunes have improved. Luck has played a large part. Nuclear brinkmanship on the Indian subcontinent coupled with turmoil in Indonesia saved him from an embarrassing roasting by other G8 leaders at the Birmingham summit a month ago for failing to attend adequately to the economic malaise in Japan. 
Meanwhile, squabbling within the opposition has again helped Mr Hashimoto shore up his position. The popular Naoto Kan, leader of the recently relaunched DPJ, has failed to unite his disparate forces. Though the DPJ is now the largest opposition group in the Diet, it has come up with only 21 official candidates for the 126 seats to be contested in the coming election, and only a further 23 for the 50 seats allocated by proportional representation. Most people expect the party to struggle to get its 18 members standing for re-election back into the upper house. 
By contrast, the LDP, with 61 of its seats up for re-election, has 85 candidates. If the turnout is low, as expected, Mr Hashimoto's party could clinch 69 seats or more. That would give it an overall majority in the upper house as well as in the lower one-something it has not enjoyed since 1989. The LDP would then be able to rule without the support of its two small coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party and the Sakigake. The four-year-old alliance has anyway recently unravelled. 
Staying on 
The prospect of a big win in July has silenced Mr Hashimoto's critics within his party Those trying to oust him have now crept back into line. And with no clear successor on the horizon (see box on next page), Mr Hashimoto stands a surprisingly good chance of serving out the remainder of his term. Until recently, it had been widely assumed that, instead of staying in office until September 1999, he would resign as an act of contrition for his party's dismal showing in the July election and for the country's financial mess. 
Yet all is not quite well for Mr Hashimoto. Though the election prospects have brightened, the financial mess gets worse. On June 12th, the government's Economic Planning Agency at last admitted what private economists have been saying for months: the country is in its worst recession since the second world war. The economy shrank by 1.3% between January and March this year, the second quarter in a row it has declined. The government still clings to its hope of 1.9% growth this year. But the consensus is that GDP will either stagnate or shrink a little more. 
What is clear, however, is that the current era of economic mismanagement is drawing to a close. Once the upper-house election is out of the way, two things are expected in brisk order. One will be an extraordinary Diet session to deal with important bills that had to be put aside this spring. The more pressing business for the government then was the emergency legislation needed to break its own fiscal guidelines, to bail out the banks and to rush through a 16.6 trillion ($120 billion) supplementary budget designed to prevent the economy from collapsing further. 
An extraordinary session was going to be needed anyway to elect a new speaker of the upper house and to confirm the number of seats won by the various parties. Normally, such sessions last for only a few days, but Mr Hashimoto wants to spend a month or more clearing up various bits of parliamentary business, especially transferring to the budget the remaining 24 trillion of debts run up by Japan's national railway before it was privatised in 1987. 
The second thing Mr Hashimoto is expected to do is to shuffle his cabinet. He will have to replace 72-year-old Kokichi Shimoinaba, the justice minister, who is giving up his seat in the upper house. It is not clear whether the prime minister will also shuffle the rest of the cabinet next month, or wait until the LDP's ritual reappointment time in late September. 
Apart from Mr Hashimoto's own job as president of the ruling party (and thus prime minister), the terms of the LDP's top three officials all expire at the end of September. Though Mr Hashimoto himself may have little difficulty remaining as party leader, his deputy, Koichi Kato, is itching for a change. The valuable Mr Kato, who engineered the LDP'S lower-house victory in 1996 and is the brains behind its up per-house campaign, has already served as the party's secretary-general for two terms. If Mr Kato is one day to serve as prime minister, he needs a big job in the cabinet now. Besides, someone of his calibre is needed as finance minister-the post he is likely to be offered-if the present fiasco is to end. 
To prepare himself, Mr Kato has spent the past few weeks attending to the country's most debilitating problem of all-the quantity of non-performing loans that are threatening the banking system, causing bankruptcies to rocket and pushing unemployment to record levels. Were Mr Kato to be put at the helm of the finance ministry, he would, it is hoped, put some urgency behind much-needed tax reforms. Action is also expected in an effort to strengthen the Resolution and Collection Bank, which is meant to dispose of the bad debts left over from failed banks. 
Concern had been growing that the world's financial markets were losing patience with Mr Hashimoto and that a lack of confidence in Japan would continue to weaken the yen and cause the Nikkei stockmarket index to plunge even deeper. But things seemed to brighten for the prime minister on June 17th. After a talk on the telephone with Bill Clinton, Japan and the United States said they would act together to stop the collapse of the yen. Many feared a falling yen would not only deepen East Asia's financial troubles but damage the world economy, too. 
So, if political stability is the first step towards financial stability, Japan may be about to turn the corner. On June 14th, it went largely unnoticed that Mr Hashimoto had been in office for longer (some 886 days in all) than Japan's domineering twoterm prime minister from the 1970s, Kakuei Tanaka. If he lasts to the end of his term, Mr Hashimoto-popular or not-will become one of modern Japan's longestserving prime ministers.

 Yet all is not quite well for Ryutaro Hashimoto . Though the election prospects have brightened , the financial mess gets worse . On June 12th , the government 's Economic Planning Agency at last admitted what private economists have been saying for months : the country is in its worst recession since the second world war . The economy shrank by 1.3 % between January and March this year , the second quarter in a row it has declined . The government still clings to its hope of 1.9 % growth this year . But the consensus is that GDP will either stagnate or shrink a little more . 
 What is clear , however , is that the current era of economic mismanagement is drawing to a close . Once the upper - house election is out of the way , two things are expected in brisk order . One will be an extraordinary Diet session to deal with important bills that had to be put aside this spring . The more pressing business for the government then was the emergency legislation needed to break its own fiscal guidelines , to bail out the banks and to rush through a 16.6 trillion ( $ 120 billion ) supplementary budget designed to prevent the economy from collapsing further . 
 An extraordinary session was going to be needed anyway to elect a new speaker of the upper house and to confirm the number of seats won by the various parties . Normally , such sessions last for only a few days , but Ryutaro Hashimoto wants to spend a month or more clearing up various bits of parliamentary business , especially transferring to the budget the remaining 24 trillion of debts run up by Japan 's national railway before it was privatised in 1987 . 
 The second thing Ryutaro Hashimoto is expected to do is to shuffle Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet . Ryutaro Hashimoto will have to replace 72 - year - old Kokichi Shimoinaba , the justice minister , who is giving up his seat in the upper house . It is not clear whether Ryutaro Hashimoto will also shuffle the rest of the cabinet next month , or wait until the LDP 's ritual reappointment time in late September . 
 Apart from Ryutaro Hashimoto's own job as president of the ruling party ( and thus prime minister ) , the terms of the LDP 's top three officials all expire at the end of September . Though Ryutaro Hashimoto may have little difficulty remaining as party leader , Ryutaro Hashimoto's deputy , Koichi Kato , is itching for a change . The valuable Mr Kato , who engineered the LDP 'S lower - house victory in 1996 and is the brains behind its up per - house campaign , has already served as the party 's secretary - general for two terms . If Mr Kato is one day to serve as prime minister , he needs a big job in the cabinet now . Besides , someone of his calibre is needed as finance minister - the post he is likely to be offered - if the present fiasco is to end . 
 To prepare himself , Mr Kato has spent the past few weeks attending to the country 's most debilitating problem of all - the quantity of non - performing loans that are threatening the banking system , causing bankruptcies to rocket and pushing unemployment to record levels . Were Mr Kato to be put at the helm of the finance ministry , he would , it is hoped , put some urgency behind much - needed tax reforms . Action is also expected in an effort to strengthen the Resolution and Collection Bank , which is meant to dispose of the bad debts left over from failed banks . 
 Concern had been growing that the world 's financial markets were losing patience with Ryutaro Hashimoto and that a lack of confidence in Japan would continue to weaken the yen and cause the Nikkei stockmarket index to plunge even deeper . But things seemed to brighten for Ryutaro Hashimoto on June 17th . After a talk on the telephone with Bill Clinton , Japan and the United States said they would act together to stop the collapse of the yen . Many feared a falling yen would not only deepen East Asia 's financial troubles but damage the world economy , too . 
 So , if political stability is the first step towards financial stability , Japan may be about to turn the corner . On June 14th , it went largely unnoticed that Ryutaro Hashimoto had been in office for longer ( some 886 days in all ) than Japan 's domineering twoterm prime minister from the 1970s , Kakuei Tanaka . If Ryutaro Hashimoto lasts to the end of Ryutaro Hashimoto's term , Mr Hashimoto - popular or not - will become one of modern Japan 's longestserving prime ministers .",740,Japan,A29-8197,IN TERM,True,"Ryutaro Hashimoto , the prime minister",32,True

But he can count himself lucky. For once the LDP has found itself without its usual back-stabbing band of potential leaders. At present, few probably want his job. 
The electoral reforms of 1994, which made campaigning for the Diet (parliament) cheaper, also weakened the influence of the LDP'S old factional bossesand the role they played in doling out campaign cash and promoting young lieutenants from within. Divided and confused, the LDP is in transition. 
As a result, rising stars are difficult to spot. Among the obvious contenders are Keizo Obuchi, Koichi Kato and,just possibly,Junichiro Koizumi. All three are senior politicians, each with more than nine terms in parliament. The affable Mr Obuchi, 60, is foreign minister and an old-style LDP operator with strong ties to Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister and nowadays the party don whose approval is needed for everything. With his solid power-base, Mr Obuchi is theoretically the front-runner to take over when Mr Hashimoto stands down. But he has not improved his prospects by letting Mr Kato grab the limelight. 
As the party's secretary-general, Mr Kato, 59, holds a position that gives him great influence over the selection of candidates and the allocation of campaign funds. But Mr Kato, a former diplomat, is not a minister and lacks experience in a heavyweight cabinet job such as foreign affairs or finance. 
Mr Koizumi, 56, is the gadfly health and welfare minister. As the party's selfappointed conscience, he is a maverick with no particular patron within the LDP. But he is regarded as the visionary among the new generation of leaders and is at ease on the international stage. His image as a dashing, passionate politician has won him a big public following, which will not go unnoticed if the LDP's popularity fades. 
Less obvious and less experienced are Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister whose grandmother, Akiko Yosano, was a famous poet; Nobutaka Machimura, 53, the education minister, who was at Tokyo University during a student revolt in the 96os and played a part as a mediator; and Sadakazu Tanigaki, also 53, the minister in charge of science and technology. But none seems to have the stomach for the kind of bare-knuckled fight that is needed to make it to the top. 
The long shots are Kazuyoshi Kaneko and Tadamori Oshima. Mr Kaneko, 55, is a financial whizz-and also a dab hand at tennis; he is respected for his understanding of international affairs. Mr Oshima, 51, has a reputation for coming up with original ideas and is a tough political fighter; he worked for the Mainichi newspaper before entering politics. 
With Japan's economy in such a mess, the LDP could, however, fragment once more. The most likely outcome then would be for the LDP'S right wing to split off and form an alliance with Ichiro Ozawa, who was once a political heavyweight in the ruling party but now leads a dwindling band of conservatives in the opposition. Meanwhile, the rump of the LDP would probably form a coalition with Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan.

The China Bill Clinton will discover during his visit this week is a country more concemed with economic growth than military power, and unlikely to be able to assert leadership in the region so long as America stays involved 
EVER since Thucydides's explanation of the Peloponnesian war, historians have known that the rise of a new power has been attended by uncertainty and anxieties. Often, though not always, violent conflict has followed. The rise in the economic and military power of China, the world's most populous country, will be a central question for Asia and for American foreign policy at the beginning of a new century. Explaining why democratic Athens decided to break a treaty that led to war, Thucydides pointed to the power of expectations of inevitable conflict. ""The general belief was that whatever happened, war with the Peloponnese was bound to come,"" he wrote. Belief in the inevitability of conflict with China could have similar self-fulfilling effects. 
Thucydides attributed the real cause of war to the rise in the power of Athens and the fear that created in Sparta. One does not have to linger long in Washington these days to encounter anxiety about China. President Clinton's visit to Beijing has been broadly criticised. Three times in two weeks recently, the House of Representatives rebuked the administration over China by large majorities. To some extent, those votes reflected partisan wrangling in an election year. Republicans have made campaign issues out of the sloppiness of Democratic Party fund-raising and questions of technology transfer involved in allowing China to launch American commercial satellites. (Whatever the wisdom of allowing such launches, the policy originated in Republican administrations.) 
The domestic politics of China policy, however, are more complicated than these particular issues. Many Democrats also voted to condemn the president's visit. The split over China policy is not between liberals and conservatives. As the speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, has said, ""Some of my friends are in the opponent business and want a new enemy."" In addition, America's religious right objects to religious persecution and forced abortion; liberals object to human-rights violations and worker exploitation. Both the liberal New Republic and the conservative Weekly Standard call China ""totalitarian"", though today's market communism is a far cry from the real totalitarianism of Chairman Mao. The domestic politics of China policy, however, are a strange alliance of left and right against the centre. The central lines of policy have been in place since the Nixon administration. The policy was broadly accepted during the cold war, but criticised after the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings. 
Ironically, Bill Clinton attacked George Bush's China policy (from the left) in the 1992 campaign, but soon switched to the centre once he was in office. Now Mr Clinton has inherited the criticism, and finds support for his trip from none other than Mr Bush. In a recent speech, Mr Clinton defended his trip: ""Some Americans believe we should try to isolate and contain China because of its undemocratic system and human-rights violation, and in order to retard its capacity to become America's next great enemy . . . Choosing isolation over engagement would not make the world safer. It would make it more dangerous."" Critics to the contrary, Mr Clinton's rationale stressed long-term strategy, not short-run commercial considerations. 
What are the facts about China's power? The ""rise of China"" is, of course, a misnomer. ""Re-emergence"" would be more accurate. By its size and history, China has long been a major power in the Asia-Pacific region. Technologically and economically, China was the world's leader (though without global reach) from 500 to 1500. Only in the past halfmillennium was it overtaken by Europe and America. China's experience was partly the result of internal problems, but it also reflected broader global changes that affected the world as a whole Japan was the Asian leader in adapting to these global economic forces, and its early success compounded China's losses between 1895 and 1945. 
Before 1979, China was not yet part of the East Asian transformation. In 1978, China was poorer per head than Korea or Taiwan in 1960. Since then China's history has been dominated by economics, with growth rates of 8-9% per year that have led to a tripling of its GNP in less than two decades. At a more sustainable rate of growth of 6% per head, China would reach $10,000-per-person income in 30 years and its economy would then total about $16 trillion, or twice the size of the current American economy. The Asian Development Bank projects Chinese income per head to reach the equivalent of about 38% of the United States' in 2025, about the same relative level that South Korea reached in 1990. 
Look both ways 
Linear projections are suspect, and China faces short-term problems with its stateowned enterprises, its shaky banking system and the value of its currency. Over the long term, the Asian Development Bank posits two scenarios (assuming no major political disruptions The optimistic scenario foresees growth of 7-8% per head over the next decade, falling toward 5-6% in the 2020s as dependency rates rise and savings fall. Under the pessimistic scenario, China would fail to make essential reforms and bottlenecks and growing income equality would slow growth to 4-5% per head. Even at the higher growth rates, China would lag behind the OECD countries in terms of income per person. 
Is China's growing economic strength a base for equivalent military power? The answer is contentious, since China does not divulge all its defence-related expenditure. The official military budget does not account for the 600,000 People's Armed Police, nuclear-weapons procurement, some defence-related RSD, or soldiers' pensions. In a recent book, ""The Coming Conflict with China"", Richard Bernstein and Ross Munro argue that 
the official Chinese military budget for 1996 was 69.8 billion yuan or about $8.7 billion. The most conservative western analysts would multiply that figure by three, to reach a $26.1 billion amount. That is already close to half the Japanese defence budget, which is roughly $50 billion. Our multiple of ten would put China's actual defence spending at around $87 billion per year, which would make it nearly one-third the amount of American spending. Moreover, the 6 figure was 11.3% higher than 1995. 
Other analysts are less alarmist than Messrs Bernstein and Munro. The EastWest Centre in Hawaii argues that 
China's military modernisation is still far from meeting its defence needs. Military expenditures have been very low, especially when considered against the size of the country and military... China's low military spending reflects a clearcut policy choice-that military modernisation is subordinated to and supportive of national economic reconstruction. 
Military spending dropped steadily in the 1980s. In the 1990s, it began to increase moderately, partly in response to the events of Tiananmen Square in 1989 and partly due to the lessons of the Gulf war two years later. Much of China's increased spending was applied to salaries and infrastructure, not to weapons systems. 
American government figures show that, adjusted for inflation, China's military spending declined slightly between 1984 and 1994. Much of China's equipment is obsolete; command, control and communications capabilities are weak; combined-forces exercises are limited; and power-projection capabilities are very limited. In the Taiwan Straits imbroglio of 1996, most expert observers believed that Taiwan could have repelled a cross-straits invasion even without the United States' navy becoming involved. 
Chinese capability to fight a serious engagement in the South China Sea is also doubtful. A leaked American navy report concluded that the Chinese air force and naval air force are ""obsolescent and incapable of mounting any effective large-scale and sustained air operations."" 
Chinese military leaders are well aware of these deficiencies and want to correct them. The Gulf war showed them how far China lagged behind modem military capabilities, and the Taiwan events of 1996 reinforced their concern to improve their offshore capability. Because of the economic distress of the former Soviet states, and joint Russian and Chinese concerns about American global dominance, China has been able to import impressive ex-Soviet equipment at reasonable prices. The key question, however, is how quickly new imports and investments will remedy the current defects of Chinese military forces. 
The systems question 
Those who wish to paint an alarming picture concentrate on the new equipment and its capabilities. Those who wish to paint a less alarming picture point out that success in battle requires the integration of new equipment with existing capabilities and doctrines, many of which remain deficient. For instance, having first-class longdistance fighters or even an aircraft carrier does not ensure dominance of the South China Sea unless logistics and command and control are adequate to the task. It is not enough just to have a few pieces of the puzzle. 
David Shambaugh, an analyst of the Chinese armed forces, argues that ""The recent hype in the media and by those in the American political system about the socalled Chinese threat is grossly overblown, not empirically grounded, irresponsible and politically dangerous."" 
Whatever the accuracy of such assessments of China's military programmes, the key question is net assessment, and that depends on what the United States (and other countries) will be doing over the next decades. The United States will not be standing still. Military power in the information age will depend on the ability to collect, process, act upon and disseminate information so as to achieve dominant battle-space awareness. This will depend on such technologies as space-based surveillance, direct broadcasting, high-speed computers and, above all, the ability to integrate complex information systems. Other countries will develop some of these technologies but the key capacity will be the ability to integrate a system of systems. 
Again, having a piece of the puzzle is not sufficient. The position of the American economy as the leader in information technologies combined with the investments in the American defence budget make it very unlikely that the United States will lose this lead. According to an Australian expert, Paul Dibb, the revolution in military affairs will continue to favour heavily American military predominance. It is not likely that China will, in any meaningful way, close the gap with America. 
Chinese military strength is likely to grow over the next decades. Even if that does not make China a global or even regional power equivalent to the United States, it does mean that China is likely to look more awesome to its regional neighbours, and its enhanced capabilities will mean that any American military tasks will require greater forces and resources than is the case at present. In other words, the rise of Chinese military power, similar to the rise of its economic power, must be taken seriously as a new factor in the region; but China will not be a global challenger to the United States, nor will it be able to exercise regional hegemony so long as the United States stays involved in East Asia. 
Common interests 
The Clinton administration has described its policy towards China as ""constructive engagement"", but the debate between ""containment"" and ""engagement"" is too simple. Engagement does not prescribe how to handle hard issues such as Taiwan, trade or human rights. It did not preclude the Clinton administration from sending two carriers to patrol off Taiwan in 1996, or from insisting on proper conditions for Chinese entry into the World Trade Organisation. 
Despite the descriptive inadequacy of the slogans, ""engagement"" signifies that the United States has rejected the inevitability of conflict. President Clinton told President Jiang Zemin in 1995 that a ""stable, open and prosperous China-in other words, a strong China-is in our interest. We welcome China to the great-power table. But great powers also have great responsibilities."" The United States has also reaffirmed its commitment to a ""one-China"" policy, thus ruling out any flirtation with the idea of independence for Taiwan, the single most dangerous scenario for potential conflict between the United States and China. The United States remains committed by law and policy to ensuring that Taiwan cannot be taken over by force, but not to defending its independence should the island declare it unilaterally. 
Notwithstanding differences on trade, human rights and some of the details of non-proliferation policy that are likely to arise at the summit, the United States also sees common interests with China. As Mr Clinton pointed out last week, both countries have an interest in stability that allows the economic prosperity of the region to grow, and China has acted responsibly in the recent financial crisis. Neither country wants a conflict on the Korean peninsula or in Asia following the Indian and Pakistani tests. Chinese behaviour on proliferation has improved considerably over the past decade. Moreover, a weak or chaotic China that could not feed its people, stem flows of refugees, deal with smuggling or manage its environmental problems is not in America's interest. 
In February 1995, the Defence Department issued a report, ""United States Strategy for the East Asia-Pacific Region"", that outlined a four-part strategy: 
maintain the forward presence of about 100,000 American troops in the region; put America's alliances, particularly with Japan, on a firm basis; 
try to develop multilateral institutions such as the ASEAN Regional Forum while recognising they are still weak; 
from that position of strength, encourage China to define its interests in ways that could be compatible with America's and its neighbours'. 
The American alliance with Japan, where the largest number of troops are stationed, is critical to American strategy. Over the past three years, the security relationship has been greatly strengthened, and recent polls show that two-thirds of the Japanese people support it. In April 1996, the Japanese prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, and Mr Clinton publicly affirmed the work of a joint group that redefined the United States-Japan Security Treaty as the basis for stability in the region after the cold war, and in 1997 the two countries agreed on guidelines for defence co-operation. That reaffirmation may turn out to be one of the most important policy developments for the region. It means that China cannot play a Japan card against the United States or try to expel the Americans from the region. From that position of strength, America can work to engage China as a responsible regional power. 
The case for friendship 
How China will behave as its power grows is an open question. Unconstrained, it might some day wish to expel the United States from the region, and exercise hegemony over its neighbours. But in the real world of constraints, states learn to define their interests in practical ways. The United States will remain the largest power in the world well into the next century. The American presence in East Asia provides a stability, which, in the absence of other institutions, has benefits for all countries in the region. So long as the Americans exercise their power in a reasonable way so that other countries (including China) continue to benefit from the stabilising effects, and so long as the United States invests wisely to maintain its power resources, it is unlikely that any country or coalition will be in the position of a strong challenger. 
If the United States treats China as an enemy now, it will guarantee an enemy in the future. If China becomes aggressive in the future, the current policy is reversible. In that sense, only China can produce the conditions for its containment. If the United States engages China, there is no guarantee of friendship, but at least there will be a reasonable prospect. To discard the chances of a more benign future through a misguided belief in the inevitability of conflict would be a tragic mistake. Such a larger strategic vision, representing the bipartisan tradition on China policy, should outweigh the domestic politics that currently cloud President Clinton's trip. ","No, says Joseph Nye, of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. The China Bill Clinton will discover during his visit this week is a country more concemed with economic growth than military power, and unlikely to be able to assert leadership in the region so long as America stays involved 
EVER since Thucydides's explanation of the Peloponnesian war, historians have known that the rise of a new power has been attended by uncertainty and anxieties. Often, though not always, violent conflict has followed. The rise in the economic and military power of China, the world's most populous country, will be a central question for Asia and for American foreign policy at the beginning of a new century. Explaining why democratic Athens decided to break a treaty that led to war, Thucydides pointed to the power of expectations of inevitable conflict. ""The general belief was that whatever happened, war with the Peloponnese was bound to come,"" he wrote. Belief in the inevitability of conflict with China could have similar self-fulfilling effects. 
Thucydides attributed the real cause of war to the rise in the power of Athens and the fear that created in Sparta. One does not have to linger long in Washington these days to encounter anxiety about China. President Clinton's visit to Beijing has been broadly criticised. Three times in two weeks recently, the House of Representatives rebuked the administration over China by large majorities. To some extent, those votes reflected partisan wrangling in an election year. Republicans have made campaign issues out of the sloppiness of Democratic Party fund-raising and questions of technology transfer involved in allowing China to launch American commercial satellites. (Whatever the wisdom of allowing such launches, the policy originated in Republican administrations.) 
The domestic politics of China policy, however, are more complicated than these particular issues. Many Democrats also voted to condemn the president's visit. The split over China policy is not between liberals and conservatives. As the speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, has said, ""Some of my friends are in the opponent business and want a new enemy."" In addition, America's religious right objects to religious persecution and forced abortion; liberals object to human-rights violations and worker exploitation. Both the liberal New Republic and the conservative Weekly Standard call China ""totalitarian"", though today's market communism is a far cry from the real totalitarianism of Chairman Mao. The domestic politics of China policy, however, are a strange alliance of left and right against the centre. The central lines of policy have been in place since the Nixon administration. The policy was broadly accepted during the cold war, but criticised after the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings. 
Ironically, Bill Clinton attacked George Bush's China policy (from the left) in the 1992 campaign, but soon switched to the centre once he was in office. Now Mr Clinton has inherited the criticism, and finds support for his trip from none other than Mr Bush. In a recent speech, Mr Clinton defended his trip: ""Some Americans believe we should try to isolate and contain China because of its undemocratic system and human-rights violation, and in order to retard its capacity to become America's next great enemy . . . Choosing isolation over engagement would not make the world safer. It would make it more dangerous."" Critics to the contrary, Mr Clinton's rationale stressed long-term strategy, not short-run commercial considerations. 
What are the facts about China's power? The ""rise of China"" is, of course, a misnomer. ""Re-emergence"" would be more accurate. By its size and history, China has long been a major power in the Asia-Pacific region. Technologically and economically, China was the world's leader (though without global reach) from 500 to 1500. Only in the past halfmillennium was it overtaken by Europe and America. China's experience was partly the result of internal problems, but it also reflected broader global changes that affected the world as a whole Japan was the Asian leader in adapting to these global economic forces, and its early success compounded China's losses between 1895 and 1945. 
Before 1979, China was not yet part of the East Asian transformation. In 1978, China was poorer per head than Korea or Taiwan in 1960. Since then China's history has been dominated by economics, with growth rates of 8-9% per year that have led to a tripling of its GNP in less than two decades. At a more sustainable rate of growth of 6% per head, China would reach $10,000-per-person income in 30 years and its economy would then total about $16 trillion, or twice the size of the current American economy. The Asian Development Bank projects Chinese income per head to reach the equivalent of about 38% of the United States' in 2025, about the same relative level that South Korea reached in 1990. 
Look both ways 
Linear projections are suspect, and China faces short-term problems with its stateowned enterprises, its shaky banking system and the value of its currency. Over the long term, the Asian Development Bank posits two scenarios (assuming no major political disruptions The optimistic scenario foresees growth of 7-8% per head over the next decade, falling toward 5-6% in the 2020s as dependency rates rise and savings fall. Under the pessimistic scenario, China would fail to make essential reforms and bottlenecks and growing income equality would slow growth to 4-5% per head. Even at the higher growth rates, China would lag behind the OECD countries in terms of income per person. 
Is China's growing economic strength a base for equivalent military power? The answer is contentious, since China does not divulge all its defence-related expenditure. The official military budget does not account for the 600,000 People's Armed Police, nuclear-weapons procurement, some defence-related RSD, or soldiers' pensions. In a recent book, ""The Coming Conflict with China"", Richard Bernstein and Ross Munro argue that 
the official Chinese military budget for 1996 was 69.8 billion yuan or about $8.7 billion. The most conservative western analysts would multiply that figure by three, to reach a $26.1 billion amount. That is already close to half the Japanese defence budget, which is roughly $50 billion. Our multiple of ten would put China's actual defence spending at around $87 billion per year, which would make it nearly one-third the amount of American spending. Moreover, the 6 figure was 11.3% higher than 1995. 
Other analysts are less alarmist than Messrs Bernstein and Munro. The EastWest Centre in Hawaii argues that 
China's military modernisation is still far from meeting its defence needs. Military expenditures have been very low, especially when considered against the size of the country and military... China's low military spending reflects a clearcut policy choice-that military modernisation is subordinated to and supportive of national economic reconstruction. 
Military spending dropped steadily in the 1980s. In the 1990s, it began to increase moderately, partly in response to the events of Tiananmen Square in 1989 and partly due to the lessons of the Gulf war two years later. Much of China's increased spending was applied to salaries and infrastructure, not to weapons systems. 
American government figures show that, adjusted for inflation, China's military spending declined slightly between 1984 and 1994. Much of China's equipment is obsolete; command, control and communications capabilities are weak; combined-forces exercises are limited; and power-projection capabilities are very limited. In the Taiwan Straits imbroglio of 1996, most expert observers believed that Taiwan could have repelled a cross-straits invasion even without the United States' navy becoming involved. 
Chinese capability to fight a serious engagement in the South China Sea is also doubtful. A leaked American navy report concluded that the Chinese air force and naval air force are ""obsolescent and incapable of mounting any effective large-scale and sustained air operations."" 
Chinese military leaders are well aware of these deficiencies and want to correct them. The Gulf war showed them how far China lagged behind modem military capabilities, and the Taiwan events of 1996 reinforced their concern to improve their offshore capability. Because of the economic distress of the former Soviet states, and joint Russian and Chinese concerns about American global dominance, China has been able to import impressive ex-Soviet equipment at reasonable prices. The key question, however, is how quickly new imports and investments will remedy the current defects of Chinese military forces. 
The systems question 
Those who wish to paint an alarming picture concentrate on the new equipment and its capabilities. Those who wish to paint a less alarming picture point out that success in battle requires the integration of new equipment with existing capabilities and doctrines, many of which remain deficient. For instance, having first-class longdistance fighters or even an aircraft carrier does not ensure dominance of the South China Sea unless logistics and command and control are adequate to the task. It is not enough just to have a few pieces of the puzzle. 
David Shambaugh, an analyst of the Chinese armed forces, argues that ""The recent hype in the media and by those in the American political system about the socalled Chinese threat is grossly overblown, not empirically grounded, irresponsible and politically dangerous."" 
Whatever the accuracy of such assessments of China's military programmes, the key question is net assessment, and that depends on what the United States (and other countries) will be doing over the next decades. The United States will not be standing still. Military power in the information age will depend on the ability to collect, process, act upon and disseminate information so as to achieve dominant battle-space awareness. This will depend on such technologies as space-based surveillance, direct broadcasting, high-speed computers and, above all, the ability to integrate complex information systems. Other countries will develop some of these technologies but the key capacity will be the ability to integrate a system of systems. 
Again, having a piece of the puzzle is not sufficient. The position of the American economy as the leader in information technologies combined with the investments in the American defence budget make it very unlikely that the United States will lose this lead. According to an Australian expert, Paul Dibb, the revolution in military affairs will continue to favour heavily American military predominance. It is not likely that China will, in any meaningful way, close the gap with America. 
Chinese military strength is likely to grow over the next decades. Even if that does not make China a global or even regional power equivalent to the United States, it does mean that China is likely to look more awesome to its regional neighbours, and its enhanced capabilities will mean that any American military tasks will require greater forces and resources than is the case at present. In other words, the rise of Chinese military power, similar to the rise of its economic power, must be taken seriously as a new factor in the region; but China will not be a global challenger to the United States, nor will it be able to exercise regional hegemony so long as the United States stays involved in East Asia. 
Common interests 
The Clinton administration has described its policy towards China as ""constructive engagement"", but the debate between ""containment"" and ""engagement"" is too simple. Engagement does not prescribe how to handle hard issues such as Taiwan, trade or human rights. It did not preclude the Clinton administration from sending two carriers to patrol off Taiwan in 1996, or from insisting on proper conditions for Chinese entry into the World Trade Organisation. 
Despite the descriptive inadequacy of the slogans, ""engagement"" signifies that the United States has rejected the inevitability of conflict. President Clinton told President Jiang Zemin in 1995 that a ""stable, open and prosperous China-in other words, a strong China-is in our interest. We welcome China to the great-power table.

ENOUGH, America seemed to say, was enough. Thoroughly fed up with Japan's lack of progress in sorting out its economy and its banking mess, and having been forced, oh-so-reluctantly, to step in to stop the yen going into free fall last week, America dispatched Larry Summers, the number two at the Treasury, to read the riot act to the Japanese government. He did not bother with subtlety. The yen will fall again, and soon, Mr Summers said, unless Japan takes immediate steps to reform and resuscitate its economy. Chief among these is to cut out, once and for all, the cancer at the heart of the Japanese economy: the country's tottering banks. 
The breathing space has indeed been brief. This week the yen tumbled again, breaching Y141 to the dollar on June zq th. Bond yields have again started to fall, a sign that the markets believe the economy is going nowhere. Although the government is urgently preparing a ""total plan"" to solve the problems of the banking system, the details will not be announced until July 8th. That may not be soon enough: the stockmarket reckons that Long Term Credit Bank is in imminent danger of collapse. If it goes, others will follow. Timidity and prevarication increase the chances of a collapse in confidence of all banks, shares in which have already fallen sharply in recent weeks (see chart on page 73). 
The latest estimate from the Finance Ministry is that the problem loans of the banking system amount to some 77 trillion ($548 billion). Already an underestimate (the number was based on banks' unaudited self-assessments last year), this sum is still being increased by the onset of recession, a record number of business bankruptcies and the banks' exposures elsewhere in Asia, which total $z49 billion, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Some analysts think that the true amount of non-performing loans is more than 100 trillion and climbing. 
True, Japanese banks have been putting aside reserves against these bad loans. In the past year the biggest banks alone set aside 12.31 trillion; over the past seven years, they have used up their equity twice over in reserving. But these reserves pale against the mounting losses. Worse, rather than writing their bad loans off, Japanese banks have merely written most of them down. A Bank of Japan official guesses they have treated 70% or more this way. This is not mere hair splitting. When a loan is written off, its accounting value is reduced to zero so the bank can suffer no further losses. 
Writing a loan down, on the other hand, means that it stays on the bank's balance sheet at a reduced but perhaps still inflated value, and the collateral backing the loan is not sold. The bank must then set aside yet more reserves if the collateral-mostly raw land-falls further in value. 
The banks' ability to write off or down is fast diminishing. Banks' operating profits have risen sharply in recent years as they have invested in long-term government securities and funded these with deposits for which they have had to pay almost nothing. But the spread between short- and longterm interest rates has narrowed sharply. Throw in deregulation, which gives depositors other places to place their cash, and a weak share market, which eats away at banks' unrealised gains on their equity portfolios and thus at their capital, and it is clear that many banks are in dire straits. 
To solve Japan's banking problems, the government needs to do a number of things, and fast. It must close down insolvent institutions, transferring good loans to healthy banks and bad ones to a loanrecovery agency; remove many non-performing loans from even healthier banks' balance sheets; beef up regulation, supervision and disclosure; improve the ability of banks to sell the collateral that backs soured loans; and recapitalise the banking system. All of this will require oodles of public money. 
The government has long since promised Y30 trillion for this, but details of how it plans to spend the money are still sketchy. So far it has spent only Y1.8 trillion, much to the delight of officials at the Bank of Japan, who fretted that public money would be pumped into all banks indiscriminately. The talk is now that the government will use its cash more carefully, perhaps by forcing weak banks to merge and giving injections of capital to those that take them over, but none of this is clear. 
The government also wants to improve financial supervision. 
This week the Financial Supervision Agency took over thejob of supervising the country's banks from the Finance Ministry's banking bureau. The agency's new boss, Masaharu Hino, says that it will start investigating all of the top 19 banks (implying, presumably, that this had not been properly done before). Unfortunately, Mr Hino has a staff of only 400, and a senior official at the Bank of Japan worries not only that the banking bureau has, to all intents, imploded, but that the new agency lacks expertise. One essential step would be to tighten banks' bad-loan disclosure. Although the Finance Ministry boasts that Japan's disclosure requirements are now as demanding as those in America, the banks themselves still classify whether their own loans are good or bad; there are no external auditors. 
Building bridges 
But all of this leaves unanswered the question of what will happen to the bad loans. There is already a body, the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, which buys bad loans from solvent banks. This group, which is owned by the banks themselves, is designed merely to crystalise accounting losses so that the banks can receive tax breaks; it does not remove the bad loans from the banking system. In any case, dealing with loan losses is difficult in Japan because of a quagmire of conflicting claims on collateral and a cumbersome process for auctioning it off. The government wants to make it easier for banks to seize collateral and to set up a body to mediate among creditors over its ownership. But without an organisation to buy banks' bad loans outright, the banks will not gain the cash flow that many need to survive. 
In April the law was changed to allow an institution, called the Resolution and Collection Bank, to take over such loansbut only from banks that have failed. It has so far not been very energetic in selling the assets it has taken on. 
The biggest test of the government's resolve will be its willingness to shut insolvent institutions, thus removing overcapacity in the banking system and allowing healthy banks' margins to rise. As yet, only one big insolvent bank, Hokkaido Takushoku, has been closed, along with some smaller ones. Both the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan insist that no other big institutions are insolvent. 
The main reason that both government and bureaucrats have not been keener to shut down insolvent banks is the ill-effects they fear this might have on the economy in the short term. Shutting a bank could hurt borrowers, for the simple reason that potential replacement lenders are few and far between. Even the healthier banks do not have the capital to make fresh loans, and the capital markets are too backward to take up the slack. In the medium term, closing weak banks would boost market confidence and thus make it easier for banks to raise money, but this would not help borrowers immediately. 
Hence discussion this week has been dominated by talk about the creation of a so-called ""bridge bank"". Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, affirmed on June 24th that such a body would be set up. This, it is proposed, would lend to healthy, or at least healthyish, borrowers of failed banks, to stop them perishing. The trickiest of these are ""category two"" borrowers, companies that are behind on their debt payments but may yet pull through. Some Y65 trillion of the Y77 trillion of officially admitted problem loans are to such companies. The government wants to keep as many as possible alive. 
But a bridge bank is at best unnecessary and at worst a step in completely the wrong direction. Its job, in essence, would be to keep the banks' borrowers in business. It would almost certainly lend at rock-bottom rates to companies, such as over-extended construction contractors, that heartily deserve to fail. And its very existence would block the emergence of a proper credit market in which banks charge higher rates for lending to riskier borrowers. This, points out Jim McGinnis, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, will prevent the better-run banks from improving their own profitability. All in all, a strange way to make the banks healthy.

In the medium term, closing weak banks would boost market confidence and thus make it easier for banks to raise money, but this would not help borrowers immediately. 
Hence discussion this week has been dominated by talk about the creation of a so-called ""bridge bank"". Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, affirmed on June 24th that such a body would be set up. This, it is proposed, would lend to healthy, or at least healthyish, borrowers of failed banks, to stop them perishing. The trickiest of these are ""category two"" borrowers, companies that are behind on their debt payments but may yet pull through. Some Y65 trillion of the Y77 trillion of officially admitted problem loans are to such companies. The government wants to keep as many as possible alive. 
But a bridge bank is at best unnecessary and at worst a step in completely the wrong direction. Its job, in essence, would be to keep the banks' borrowers in business. It would almost certainly lend at rock-bottom rates to companies, such as over-extended construction contractors, that heartily deserve to fail. And its very existence would block the emergence of a proper credit market in which banks charge higher rates for lending to riskier borrowers. This, points out Jim McGinnis, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, will prevent the better-run banks from improving their own profitability. All in all, a strange way to make the banks healthy.

But attempts by foreigners to bully Japan into getting to grips with its economic woes look like back-firing badly. Until a few weeks ago, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was set to clinch a landslide victory in the crucial upperhouse election on July 12th. Having finally achieved a majority (albeit a slim one) in both houses, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, could then push through reforms needed to clear up the banks' bad debts and kickstart the economy properly. Instead, something else could happen. Mounting pressure from Washington and Brussels has forced the LDP leadership to set aside its carefully-laid election plans to focus on crisis management. As the latest polls show, Japan's large mass of floating voters (nearly 60% of the electorate) look as though they may seek greater revenge than expected on Mr Hashimoto's party for its mishandling of the economy. 
The number of people voting is still likely to be low by Japanese standards, though perhaps not quite as bad as the 44.5% turnout at the last upper-house election in 1995. Half the chamber's 252 seats are contested every three years. To regain the majority it lost in 1989, the LDP would have to win an additional eight seats on top of the 61 that it has up for re-election. 
Over the past few weeks, its chances of doing so have dwindled as the government was forced to promise foreigners permanent tax cuts and then pretend to cynical voters that this did not amount to bowing to overseas pressure and backtracking. Confusion, especially over whether the economy-boosting tax cuts that foreigners have urged on Mr Hashimoto should be made permanent or not, has only made the government look more incompetent. As worsening polls set off alarm bells in LDP headquarters, Mr Hashimoto finally announced on July 8th that the tax cuts would indeed be permanent. 
Though failure to win a majority in the upper house is not going to force a change of government, the election has turned into a referendum on Mr Hashimoto's leadership. Odds are he will survive. Recent polls by Japan's leading newspapers suggest that the LDP should win 63-65 seats-enough for it to claim victory if not an overall majority. Among the opposition, only the Japan Communist Party is expected to gain much ground through its slick grassroots machine pulling in the protest vote. 
All eyes, however, have been on the Komei. This is the second largest opposition party in the upper house after Naoto Kan's ragtag collection of politicians who recently banded together under the banner of the Democratic Party of Japan. The Komei, backed by the Buddhist-affiliated Soka Gakkai support group, which has some 8m family members, is fighting an election under its own name for the first time since the former Komeito merged with Ichiro Ozawa's now defunct New Frontier Party (NFP) back in 1994. 
The Soka Gakkai threw its vast resources behind Mr Ozawa's band of LDP rebels, hoping that the newly formed NFP would offer a serious challenge to the Liberal Democratic Party's long-standing monopoly of power. Instead, Mr Ozawa's motley crew either jumped ship for more promising opposition camps or slunk back to the LDP once they realised they were out in the cold. A disillusioned Soka Gakkai has no intention of making the same mistake twice. 
That has not stopped the LDP from paying court to the Buddhist support group. With its chances of an outright majority in the upper house fading fast and its former coalition partners (the Social Democrats and the Sakigake)vanishing from the scene, the LDP has been casting round for some other source of upper-house support. The Soka Gakkai's two dozen Komei members in the senior chamber would provide Mr Hashimoto with a handy margin for pushing through necessary reforms. Unfortunately, the Soka Gakkai has not forgiven the ruling party for accusing its honorary president, Daisaku Ikeda, of sexual improprieties. The LDP has even apologised profusely, but to no avail. ""That would be impossible,"" said Toshiko Hamayotsu, the Komei leader, when asked whether her party would join a coalition with the LDP. 
All of which means Mr Hashimoto could be in a bit of a quandary after the election. If the worst came to the worst, the ruling party would have to start talking quickly to those independent members in the upper house whom it backed as a safeguard. At least three could be arm-twisted without too much trouble into joining the LDP proper. Then it would be up to Koichi Kato, the ruling party's indefatigable secretary-general, to sweet-talk opposition members one at a time into changing sides-just as he painstakingly rebuilt the LDP'S majority in the lower house two years ago.

1998-07-18,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224100186/fulltext/46EDB7E7B2564077PQ/20?accountid=14657,"Japan's voters protested and Mr Hashimoto resigned, but can the powers behind the scenes produce a better leader? 
SAY what you will about Ryutaro Hashimoto, the outgoing prime minister had a vision of sorts about how to reform Japan and drag its fossilised financial systems and bureaucracy into the next century. True, he misread the economic signals disastrously and taxed the country into its worst recession since the second world war. With no power base inside the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he relied too much on an ineffective civil service demoralised by blunders and shenanigans. Above all, he was guilty of equivocating when action was called for. But for all his faults, Mr Hashimoto was head and shoulders above his probable replacement. 
No one expected the scale of the ruling party's defeat in the election on July 12th for half the 252 seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament). Flush from recent byelection successes, the LDP faced a handsome victory. Some in the party had begun to think it might regain the overall majority it lost at the height of the Recruit (shares-forfavours) scandal in 1989. Coupled with its majority in the more important lower house, the LDP could then rule without watering down legislation for the sake of its coalition partners. 
The upper house actually has more clout than most people realise, through its ability to block some legislation. Although the LDP has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it has nowhere near the twothirds necessary to overturn an upperhouse veto. So it has relied for the past two and a half years on the help of two small opposition groups, the Social Democratic Party and the New Party Sakigake, to ensure that its bills were never mired in the upper house. All that will now change for the worse, causing serious setbacks for Japan's economic and financial reforms, as well as its foreign relations. 
The surprise about the outcome had its origins in the turnout. At the upper-house election in 1995, the turnout fell to a record low of 44.5% This time, with the voting hours extended and postal-voting restrictions relaxed, the figure was expected to rise. It did-and how. With unseasonably mild weather and nothing much on television, an almost unprecedented 58.8% of Japan's 100m eligible voters cast their ballots, one for the candidate of their choice under the prefectural system and one for the party of their choice under the proportional-representation system. 
According to the exit polls, the additional votes came almost exclusively from the uncommitted (close on 60% of the electorate), especially in the cities. What seems to have stirred people were noisy demands by foreigners for Japan to make recent tax cuts permanent to help revive the moribund economy. Mr Hashimoto had hummed and hawed about this suggestion because of worries over the country's soaring budget deficit, and agreed to it only on the eve of the election. 
The protest votes went almost exclusively to independent candidates in the prefectural poll and to Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in the proportional-representation part. Overall, independents now account for 25 seats (up from 13) in the upper house and the DPJ for 47 seats (up from 38) Meanwhile, enough of the ruling party's faithful vented their anger by staying at home-causing the LDP to end up with only 103 seats (down from 118). Mr Hashimoto duly fell on his sword in the traditional fashion. 
The front-runner for his job as party president (which, because of the LDP's lower-house majority, also means prime minister) is the pleasant but ineffectual Keizo Obuchi, who has been whiling away his time as foreign minister. Mr Obuchi's sole qualification is that he is the nominal head of the largest faction within the LDP, and it wants its man in the Kantei, the prime minister's residence, so that it can have the plum jobs in the cabinet and party executive. But there are other shadowy forces thrusting Mr Obuchi forward. 
The ""Gang of Four"", which has managed party affairs and set the government's agenda for most of Mr Hashimoto's term, is loth to lose its grip on power. Headed by Koichi Kato, the party's secretary-general, this group includes Hiromu Nonaka, the acting secretary-general, Taku Yamazaki, the party's policy chief, and Yoshiro Mori, chairman of the LDP'S general council. 
With the exception of Mr Nonaka, who is 72, the gang are in their late 50s or early 6os-and anxious to keep their places in line for the leadership. Mr Nonaka, a senior statesman in the Obuchi faction, wields awesome political clout behind the scenes thanks to his close ties with Noboru Takeshita, the faction's former boss and prime minister a decade ago-and nowadays the ""Shogun in the Dark"" whose approval is needed for most things. But whereas none of the other members of the gang owes any allegiance to the Obuchi faction, each is prepared to back Mr Obuchi for other reasons. One is that, having little himself to offer, Mr Obuchi would allow them to wield even greater influence over party and government affairs. The other is that the alternative, as they see it, would be disastrous. 
That alternative is Seiroku Kajiyama, a former chief cabinet secretary and powerbroker within the Obuchi faction. The 72year-old Mr Kajiyama would at least liven things up. Though no expert in finance or economics, he is a rocket scientist compared with Mr Obuchi. But because of his enthusiasm for an alliance with Ichiro Ozawa's right-wing Liberal Party, the LDP barons fear that Mr Kajiyama's appointment could be too divisive. Some fear it would lead to the break-up of the LDP. Mr Kajiyama has the support of his party's old brigade, but he is dreaded by younger members who fear he would cost them their seats. Mr Kajiyama's chances took a turn for the worse on July 15th when the LDP decided that its new leader would be chosen by a secret ballot, rather than the usual behind-the-doors deals. 
The vote means that other candidates are expected to throw their hats into the ring. The health and welfare minister,Junichiro Koizumi, is one. Mr Koizumi has impeccable credentials as a reformist and is a favourite among the party's younger generation. He is also the only weapon the ruling party has for countering the populist Mr Kan, whose DPJ looks like providing the LDP with its biggest challenge. Other names being bandied about include Yohei Kono, who served as the LDP chief, but not prime minister, from 1993 to 1995. A long shot is Sadakazu Tanigaki, the director-general of the science and technology agency. 
With no one candidate having emerged as an obvious replacement for Mr Hashimoto, the vote on July 24th is shaping up to be a classic LDP battle of the generationswith the geriatric right favouring Mr Kajiyama-if he still insists on standing-and the younger members voting with the Gang of Four for Mr Obuchi, unless a reformer such as Mr Koizumi joins the race. Although a general election will have to be held within two years, and may take place as early as next January or February, the betting is that the dull Mr Obuchi will win the party presidency and thus become prime minister-and that the LDP will come to rue the day. ","Japan 's voters protested and Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned , but can the powers behind the scenes produce a better leader ? 
 SAY what you will about Ryutaro Hashimoto had a vision of sorts about how to reform Japan and drag its fossilised financial systems and bureaucracy into the next century . True , Ryutaro Hashimoto misread the economic signals disastrously and taxed the country into its worst recession since the second world war . With no power base inside the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , Ryutaro Hashimoto relied too much on an ineffective civil service demoralised by blunders and shenanigans . Above all , Ryutaro Hashimoto was guilty of equivocating when action was called for . But for all Ryutaro Hashimoto's faults , Ryutaro Hashimoto was head and shoulders above Ryutaro Hashimoto's probable replacement . 
 No one expected the scale of the ruling party 's defeat in the election on July 12th for half the 252 seats in the upper house of the Diet ( parliament ) . Flush from recent byelection successes , the LDP faced a handsome victory . Some in the party had begun to think it might regain the overall majority it lost at the height of the Recruit ( shares - forfavours ) scandal in 1989 . Coupled with its majority in the more important lower house , the LDP could then rule without watering down legislation for the sake of its coalition partners . 
 The upper house actually has more clout than most people realise , through its ability to block some legislation . Although the LDP has a comfortable majority in the lower house , it has nowhere near the twothirds necessary to overturn an upperhouse veto . So it has relied for the past two and a half years on the help of two small opposition groups , the Social Democratic Party and the New Party Sakigake , to ensure that its bills were never mired in the upper house . All that will now change for the worse , causing serious setbacks for Japan 's economic and financial reforms , as well as its foreign relations . 
 The surprise about the outcome had its origins in the turnout . At the upper - house election in 1995 , the turnout fell to a record low of 44.5 % This time , with the voting hours extended and postal - voting restrictions relaxed , the figure was expected to rise . It did - and how . With unseasonably mild weather and nothing much on television , an almost unprecedented 58.8 % of Japan 's 100 m eligible voters cast their ballots , one for the candidate of their choice under the prefectural system and one for the party of their choice under the proportional - representation system . 
 According to the exit polls , the additional votes came almost exclusively from the uncommitted ( close on 60 % of the electorate ) , especially in the cities . What seems to have stirred people were noisy demands by foreigners for Japan to make recent tax cuts permanent to help revive the moribund economy . Ryutaro Hashimoto had hummed and hawed about this suggestion because of worries over the country 's soaring budget deficit , and agreed to it only on the eve of the election . 
 The protest votes went almost exclusively to independent candidates in the prefectural poll and to Naoto Kan 's Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) in the proportional - representation part . Overall , independents now account for 25 seats ( up from 13 ) in the upper house and the DPJ for 47 seats ( up from 38 ) Meanwhile , enough of the ruling party 's faithful vented their anger by staying at home - causing the LDP to end up with only 103 seats ( down from 118 ) . Ryutaro Hashimoto duly fell on Ryutaro Hashimoto's sword in the traditional fashion . 
 The front - runner for Ryutaro Hashimoto's job as party president ( which , because of the LDP 's lower - house majority , also means prime minister ) is the pleasant but ineffectual Keizo Obuchi , who has been whiling away his time as foreign minister . Mr Obuchi 's sole qualification is that he is the nominal head of the largest faction within the LDP , and it wants its man in the Kantei , the prime minister 's residence , so that it can have the plum jobs in the cabinet and party executive . But there are other shadowy forces thrusting Mr Obuchi forward .

The three countries are the founders and signatories of a 1994 convention that is supposed to conserve stocks of the southern bluefin tuna, a fish much prized by lovers of Japanese sushi and sashimi. But even though the southern bluefin is considered by Australia and New Zealand to be an endangered species, a fleet of 65 Japanese fishing boats has set sail to catch more than the conservation agreement allows. 
On July 13th, after a protest to the Jap anese ambassador, New Zealand closed its ports to all Japanese tuna fishers. Australia had done likewise earlier this year. Both countries are angry at Japan's decision to begin an ""experimental"" programme to catch an additional 1,400 tonnes of southern bluefin in the southern stretches of the Indian Ocean. Japan already has a 6,065-tonne share of the total quota of 11,750 tonnes. 
The row has been simmering for months. During a visit to Tokyo in March, New Zealand's prime minister, Jenny Shipley, raised the issue with the now outgoing Japanese prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto. She argued that southern bluefin were an international resource and that Japan should stick to the agreement to allow stocks of the migratory fish to recover. Japan, however, claims there is no scientific evidence to show that the species is endangered. 
Many Australian and New Zealand tuna fishermen believe Japan has simply bowed to pressure for a bigger catch from its powerful fishing industry. The market for tuna is lucrative. A southern bluefin can fetch vim ($7,100) in Tokyo's fish market, and top specimens much more. Australian exports of southern bluefin are worth an estimated $A100m ($62m) a year and New Zealand's about a quarter of that. The idea of the convention is to create a healthy long-term future for the fishermen of all three countries. 
The issue could grow into wider trade row. A tuna war with Japan would be an awkward forerunner to a plan to create free trade in food products, which is supposed to be launched at the APEC summit in New Zealand in 1999.

EVEN before Japan's new prime minister is officially anointed in his job in an extraordinary session of the Diet(parliament) on July 30th, expectations are rising. The hope is that action will at last be taken to stir the world's second-largest economy from the coma that it has been slipping in and out of ever since the country's ""bubble"" economy collapsed seven years ago. While the world waits to discover exactly what the new prime minister intends to do, it has become clear that a fundamental change in Japanese political life is now gaining pace. 
Some believe it will not matter all that much who turns out to have won the secret ballot held on July 24th by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to become the LDP'S new president, and hence prime minister. On the face of it there was little difference between the three candidates who had thrown their hats into the ring: Keizo Obuchi, the polite but bland foreign minister; Seiroku Kajiyama, a former cabinet secretary; and Junichiro Koizumi, the health and welfare minister. 
All three had offered only variations on the same theme-tax cuts, a more relaxed fiscal policy, attempts to boost growth with public spending and a clear-up of the banking mess. The aim, common to all three, had been to prevent the country from sliding into a deflationary spiral, with falling prices and a rapidly shrinking economy (see page 74). Once Japanese consumers start spending again, so the theory goes, not only will Japan's economy start to recover from its worst recession since the second world war, but it will help pull the rest of East Asia out of its troubles too. 
Yet even small variations in policy could make a difference. That is why any indication about what the new prime minister may try will be of so much interest to ministers from the countries where East Asia's economic crisis began. They are gathering in Manila this week for a meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, and on July 27th delegates from Japan, China, Russia and the United States will join them. 
Many of the policies Japan's new prime minister is likely to put in place would lead to higher inflation. Indeed, a bit of inflation could work wonders for the Japanese economy, it is argued. Politically, however, it could backfire badly on the LDP. Voters dealt the party a big defeat at the recent election for the upper house, the less-powerful chamber in the Japanese parliament. This reverse not only brought about the resignation of Ryutaro Hashimoto as prime minister, but also made it painfully clear where the LDP's principal source of support now lies: more than ever before, it is primarily in the countryside and among the older people in Japan's rapidly greying society. Such people are also the main savers, and many-especially the elderly-live on fixed incomes. They would be enraged if their standard of living were made to suffer and their savings reduced in value in order to help foot the bill for the banking industry's follies. 
That thought ties the hands of the new prime minister somewhat, and largely leaves him with tax cuts and other traditional fiscal methods for getting the economy moving again. It is clear, however, that the first thing he will have to do is to shelve Mr Hashimoto's fiscal-reform law. This has already been relaxed once. It puts a cap on government spending by imposing a strict schedule for eliminating the issuing of deficit-covering bonds by 2003. By then, the budget deficit will, with luck, have come down from nearly 7% of GDP to 3%.All three candidates had promised to loosen or even discard this financial corset. 
Japan's opposition parties would happily go along. They would not quibble either with all three LDP candidates' proposals for cutting individual and corporate taxes. After zigzagging all over the place, Mr Hashimoto eventually agreed just days before the disastrous election to make a permanent tax cut-though, over-cautious to the end, he refused to say by how much.The largest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has already called for an annual Y6 trillion ($43 billion) reduction in taxes. The DPJ did well in the upperhouse election, and its leader, Naoto Kan, is surging in popularity. 
For its part, the LDP has pushed through a once-and-for-all v4 trillion cut for this year. But because of the party's hammering in the election, its new leader will have to up the ante considerably. The stickingpoint with the opposition will be over how the individual tax cuts are introduced. Any attempt to reduce the top rate and broaden the tax base, causing richer households to pay less and poorer ones to enter the tax bracket for the first time, will be resisted tooth and nail by the opposition. 
It is now apparent that Japan's new prime minister is set to face a Diet that is a good deal more confrontational. As it is on a roll, Mr Kan's Dr) will pick fights at every opportunity, hoping to force an early general election before it runs out of steam. Meanwhile, Japan's steadily expanding Communist Party, which has developed a strong grass-roots machine, is talking for the first time about co-operating with other opposition parties to put an end to the LDP's long-standing grip on power. 
All of which spells trouble for the LDP's new leader. With the party now much weaker, its bills-especially the enabling legislation needed for its ""total plan"" for restoring the debilitated financial system, as well as the coming budget and proposed tax cuts-are likely to be held hostage in the upper house by an opposition that smells blood. The upper house, for all its relative weakness, can frustrate legislation. 
So the LDP's new man will find that governing Japan is more difficult than it has ever been before. The country is entering an era of dysfunctional politics, with the possibility of one political order passing to another-providing the world with plenty of worries about Japan's politics to add to its more familiar concerns about its economy.

The ballot on Junly 24th for a new LDP leader to relace Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was stepping down after the party's poor showing in the election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament), was, she said, ""a stockclearing garage sale"". The threeway race between Keizo Obuchi, Seiroku Kajuiyama and Junichiro Koizumi was a contest ""between a bonjin [mediocrity], a gunjin [soldier] and a henjin [crackpot]"". In the event, the goodnatured bonjin easily won the stage-managed contest for the party president. 
Mr Obuchi's election as prime minister on July 3oth was then a foregone conclusion, since the LDP has an overall majority in the more powerful lower house of the Diet. But mediocre or not, Mr Obuchi's government will be quite different from its predecessor. 
The first thing to note is that Mr Obuchi won the job of party leader not thanks to the 225 party members who ostensibly voted for him (out of 414 eligible to do so). Rather, he was picked by a party boss who decided it was time to call the shots againand, above all, to get the LDP back to its old way of doing things. He is Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister who disposes from the shadows. 
Mr Takeshita was the young Mr Obuchi's mentor upon entering the Diet in 1963. Mr Takeshita later gave him his first big break, making him cabinet secretary in 1987. And it was to Mr Obuchi that Mr Takeshita handed his ruthlessly efficient Keiseikai-then, as now, the largest faction within the LDP-after his anointed successor, Ichiro Ozawa, made an abortive bid for power in 1992 and split the faction. 
The outgoing prime minister, Mr Hashimoto, had been a thorn in Mr Takeshita's side. Mr Hashimoto may have been one of Mr Takeshita's factional lieutenants. Yet he had his own way of doing things: he would ignore the party hierarchy, working closely with bureaucrats instead. For Mr Takeshita (who was forced to cut short his own term as prime minister at the height of the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal in 1989), the pliable Mr Obuchi is a far better prospect for the exercise of power. 
Mr Takeshita's hand is apparent in the LDP's new executive line-up. The choice of Yoshiro Mori as the party's new secretarygeneral, together with Yukihiko Ikeda as its policy chief and Takashi Fukaya as chairman of its general council, follows Mr Takeshita's insistence that high jobs should be handed round with regard to seniority and factional strength. 
The same factional politics have governed the way Mr Obuchi has chosen his cabinet. Here, again, it was Mr Takeshita who got another former prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, to become finance minister. Mr Miyazawa had the same job in Mr Takeshita's government a decade ago. 
Mr Miyazawa has held 13 cabinet posts over the years, and he is unquestionably the best man for the present job. He worked in the finance ministry before entering the Diet, where he went on to become head of the Economics Planning Agency at the unheard-of age of 42. His efforts to stabilise the world's currency markets in the 198os won him international respect. Even today, Mr Miyazawa's is one of the sharpest minds in politics. He is the only person in the Diet able to get the American treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, on the telephone for a technical discussion in fluent English. But it speaks volumes about the LDP's shortage of financial talent that it has to drag a 78-year-old out of semi-retirement. 
Still, the LDP bigwigs have persuaded Mr Miyazawa to take the job (against, it should be said, his own better judgment) more for his credibility with foreigners than for the ideas he may bring to the table. Both the yen and the Nikkei stockmarket index promptly rose on the first hint that he might become finance minister. However, there is no getting round the fact that Mr Miyazawa will inherit a set of fiscal and financial plans that were hurriedly drafted for Mr Obuchi's election campaign. 
As the ruling party reverts to form after its brief fling with reform, it will set out to bury many of the policies introduced during Mr Hashimoto's reign. Mr Obuchi's blueprint (or, rather, the one handed to him) requires bank failures to be avoided at any cost. Meanwhile, the economy is to be propped up with public works. Mr Hashimoto's deficit-reduction laws are to be frozen, and at least 6 trillion ($43 billion) of permanent tax cuts introduced, along with a further rio trillion in fresh spending. In short, Mr Takeshita, a firm believer in the power of public works, is taking the LDP back to pork-barrel politics. 
Will Mr Obuchi, let alone Mr Miyazawa, go along with that? They may have little choice. Unkindly, the Japanese media have started referring to Mr Obuchi as Mr Takeshita's ""goldfish shit""-a common, if vulgar, phrase used to describe someone who is forced to tag along.

Rather , he was picked by a party boss who decided it was time to call the shots againand , above all , to get the LDP back to its old way of doing things . He is Noboru Takeshita , a former prime minister who disposes from the shadows . 
 Mr Takeshita was the young Mr Obuchi 's mentor upon entering the Diet in 1963 . Mr Takeshita later gave him his first big break , making him cabinet secretary in 1987 . And it was to Mr Obuchi that Mr Takeshita handed his ruthlessly efficient Keiseikai - then , as now , the largest faction within the LDP - after his anointed successor , Ichiro Ozawa , made an abortive bid for power in 1992 and split the faction . 
 Ryutaro Hashimoto , had been a thorn in Mr Takeshita 's side . Ryutaro Hashimoto may have been one of Mr Takeshita 's factional lieutenants . Yet Ryutaro Hashimoto had Ryutaro Hashimoto's own way of doing things : Ryutaro Hashimoto would ignore the party hierarchy , working closely with bureaucrats instead . For Mr Takeshita ( who was forced to cut short his own term as prime minister at the height of the Recruit shares - for - favours scandal in 1989 ) , the pliable Mr Obuchi is a far better prospect for the exercise of power . 
 Mr Takeshita 's hand is apparent in the LDP 's new executive line - up . The choice of Yoshiro Mori as the party 's new secretarygeneral , together with Yukihiko Ikeda as its policy chief and Takashi Fukaya as chairman of its general council , follows Mr Takeshita 's insistence that high jobs should be handed round with regard to seniority and factional strength . 
 The same factional politics have governed the way Mr Obuchi has chosen his cabinet . Here , again , it was Mr Takeshita who got another former prime minister , Kiichi Miyazawa , to become finance minister . Mr Miyazawa had the same job in Mr Takeshita 's government a decade ago . 
 Mr Miyazawa has held 13 cabinet posts over the years , and he is unquestionably the best man for the present job . He worked in the finance ministry before entering the Diet , where he went on to become head of the Economics Planning Agency at the unheard - of age of 42 . His efforts to stabilise the world 's currency markets in the 198os won him international respect . Even today , Mr Miyazawa 's is one of the sharpest minds in politics . He is the only person in the Diet able to get the American treasury secretary , Robert Rubin , on the telephone for a technical discussion in fluent English . But it speaks volumes about the LDP 's shortage of financial talent that it has to drag a 78 - year - old out of semi - retirement . 
 Still , the LDP bigwigs have persuaded Mr Miyazawa to take the job ( against , it should be said , his own better judgment ) more for his credibility with foreigners than for the ideas he may bring to the table . Both the yen and the Nikkei stockmarket index promptly rose on the first hint that he might become finance minister . However , there is no getting round the fact that Mr Miyazawa will inherit a set of fiscal and financial plans that were hurriedly drafted for Mr Obuchi 's election campaign . 
 As the ruling party reverts to form after its brief fling with reform , it will set out to bury many of the policies introduced during Ryutaro Hashimoto's reign . Mr Obuchi 's blueprint ( or , rather , the one handed to him ) requires bank failures to be avoided at any cost . Meanwhile , the economy is to be propped up with public works . Ryutaro Hashimoto's deficit - reduction laws are to be frozen , and at least 6 trillion ( $ 43 billion ) of permanent tax cuts introduced , along with a further rio trillion in fresh spending . In short , Mr Takeshita , a firm believer in the power of public works , is taking the LDP back to pork - barrel politics . 
 Will Mr Obuchi , let alone Mr Miyazawa , go along with that ? They may have little choice . Unkindly , the Japanese media have started referring to Mr Obuchi as Mr Takeshita 's "" goldfish shit""-a common , if vulgar , phrase used to describe someone who is forced to tag along .",740,Japan,A29-8197,POST TERM,True,"Ryutaro Hashimoto , who was stepping down after the party 's poor showing in the election for the upper house of the Diet ( parliament )",8,True

SOUTH KOREA and Japan commemorate August 15th-the end of the second world war-for different reasons. Since 1945, South Koreans have celebrated it as a day of liberation from 36 years of Japanese rule. In Japan it is seen as a day of surrender, and cabinet ministers sometimes visit shrines to honour the memory of fallen soldiers. This has long made relations between the two countries rather delicate. With South Korea's new president, Kim Dae Jung, due to visit Tokyo in October, old wounds could again be opened. 
One of the thorniest issues Mr Kim may raise is that of hundreds of young Korean girls sent to Japanese army brothels during the second world war. ""We were liberated 53 years ago, but we have yet to receive rep aration from Japan,"" says Kim Bok Dong, one of about 150 surviving ""comfort women"" forced into sexual slavery. The Japanese government argues that the $5oom it paid the South Korean government in 1965 (when the two normalised diplomatic relations) extinguishes all claims, including reparations to the comfort women. Many Koreans disagree and say a suitable apology has never been made. 
The antagonism of the past spills over into present-daydisputes. For instance, in a row over fishing rights in January, Japan terminated an agreement with South Korea and seized some of its fishing boats. In Seoul this was seen by some as an act of aggression by a former coloniser. And even though the fishing dispute may be resolved by the time Mr Kim arrives in Tokyo, there will be other touchy subjects to discuss. 
Many expect Mr Kim to ask Japan to make some sort of official apology for its war crimes, such as sexual slavery. Historians reckon that perhaps 200,000 women and girls around Asia were put into brothels by Japanese forces. Women's groups in other countries, including Taiwan and the Philippines, have also claimed compensation. Japan's leaders, however, usually maintain that enough regrets have been offered. But many South Koreans are unsatisfied. Most appear to want something like the tearful apology made in Poland in 1970 by Willy Brandt, the West German chancellor of the day, for his country's war crimes. Yet a performance like that from a Japanese leader seems unlikely. 
The South Korean government paid comfort women 35m won ($27,000) each in April. Some have also received money from a Japanese fund which is formally private, but in fact was set up with Japanese government backing. Payments were also accompanied by a letter from Japan's then prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, expressing an apology. But the comfort women's leaders want the Japanese government to pay compensation directly and openly, and have even obtained a ruling in a lower court in Japan that the government should do that. 
The Japanese government admitted the existence of the comfort women only in 1993, and issued an apology then. Yet some Japanese ministers have since annoyed South Koreans by denying the existence of sex slaves and trying to have references to them removed from history books. When he goes to Tokyo, Mr Kim is likely to invite the Japanese emperor to visit South Korea. But acceptance is uncertain. The emperor would almost certainly receive a far more hostile reception in Seoul even than he did when he visited London in May, where former British prisoners of war demanded apologies and compensation.

THE people of Osaka are famous for their sense of humour. For those in charge of the city's finances, which are a bad joke, that is just as well. ""Our situation is very, very worrying,"" grins Masaji Hashimoto, who heads the city's budgetplanning department. ""The central government has to understand that all we can do is cut, cut, cut."" 
The government sees little to laugh at. With the economy slipping deeper into recession-this week the government gave up hope of economic growth for this year, predicting that GDP would shrink by 1.8%-the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had hoped that a public-works programme announced in April would help stop the rot. That overlooked one small detail, however: local governments were asked to do much of the spending. Instead of forking out more, some of the most financially imperilled ones, such as Osaka, are planning cuts. 
The immediate problem is the LDP's supplementary budget, passed in April, which promised 7.7 trillion-worth ($58 billion) of public-works projects. Of this, Y3 trillion was to be financed jointly by central and local governments, with the cost split 50-50. A further Y1.5 trillion, said the LDP, would be ""independent"" public works, wholly paid for by local governments. 
These promises were, it transpires, hopelessly optimistic. Miyagi, Yamagata and Iwate prefectures in northern Japan are unlikely to push through even half their independent projects, according to the Bank of Japan. Tokyo and Osaka have refused any increase in independent projects and made only modest rises in subsidised spending. Although the LDP is planning a second supplementary budget, local authorities will find it hard even to maintaining spending at current levels. Osaka, says Mr Hashimoto, faces ten years or more of intolerably large deficits unless it cuts spending. In the next fiscal year the prefecture plans to lop 10% off subsidised public works; money for projects financed locally will be halved. 
Until now, relying on local governments to carry out spending plans has suited the Tokyo bureaucrats nicely. Localgovernment debt is not counted in centralgovernment figures because the government offers no explicit guarantee that creditors will be repaid. By shifting the financing burden for deficit spending to the provinces, the central government has been able to improve its books. 
But as in all of Japan's 47 prefectural governments, Osaka's finances have been squeezed mercilessly by central demands to step up spending just as tax revenues have collapsed. They have been forced to tap rainy-day funds and to raise vast amounts of debt, which has nearly tripled in ten years (see chart). Thus impoverished, local authorities have become increasingly dependent on subsidies from Tokyo; this year, for example, four-fifths of the interest payments on shared projects will come from central-government coffers. 
Not all of it, however; and local governments still have to foot the bill for projects not shared with Tokyo. They are running out of money. Osaka has exhausted its Y100 billion of reserves. Tokyo's metropolitan government has only vi billion left from a fund that contained 35o billion a few years ago. And to make matters worse, as local authorities' debt burden has increased, investors in their bonds have begun to fret about the lack of an explicit government guarantee. At an auction in Tokyo last month, investors demanded o.3 percentage points above the ""suggested"" coupon for local-government bonds. 
Parsimonious provinces 
So the subsidies that once persuaded local officials to fall into line may no longer work. Mr Hashimoto says that any centrally inspired increases in subsidised public works will be met with cuts in independent projects. In Tokyo, the rhetoric is more strident still. ""The government is not satisfied with what we are prepared to spend,"" says Yasushi Nakamura of the city's budget bureau. ""But that is what they will get."" 
That still leaves the centre with a few options. The prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, promised this week an emergency spending package of at least io trillion. This could be explicitly financed by the central government. But that would require Mr Obuchi to take on the finance ministry's mighty budget bureau, and he is no match for it. Alternatively, the money could be used to reinvigorate personal consumption. Some of the ideas floating around Tokyo-making temporary income-tax cuts permanent, giving house-buyers tax breaks, even issuing free shopping vouchers-seek to do that. 
The likes of Osaka, though, plan to cut spending regardless. If they are to be persuaded otherwise, their battered finances need to be repaired. Some prefectural governors, for instance, are calling for a doubling of the local-government share of consumption taxes collected at the checkout. Mr Hashimoto is hopeful that, for once, the government is listening to their demands. If he is wrong, Japan could be in for a new and painful bout of belt-tightening.

Big Mac index offers a guide to whether currencies are at their ""correct"" level. It is based on purchasing-power parity-the notion that an identical basket of goods and services should cost the same in all countries. The Big Mac PrP is the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the same in America as abroad. The chart calculates the under- or overvaluation of emerging-market currencies against the dollar. Thus, dividing the local-currency price of a Big Mac in Malaysia by its American price produces a dollar ,pp of 1.63 ringgit. The actual dollar rate is 3.80 ringgit-ie, the currency is 57% undervalued. The other Asian currencies are also undervalued. At the other extreme, the currencies of Venezuela, Argentina and Israel are overvalued. The chart also shows that the yen is 9% undervalued against the dollar; the r-mark is 14% overvalued.  1999 2000 will be a year in which the world shifts its balance. America's magnificent economy will slow; Europe and Asia will pick up the slack. Overall, the world will increase its wealth by 3.5%: a fine achievement. For the third of our population that lives in China and India, prosperity will grow at twice the speed of the rich world, to all our benefit. It will be the first year in which the majority of people on the Internet do not speak English: in America the web will be used as much by women as men. The Internet will become the language of the world. There has never been a revolution of this speed. The marriage of mobile phones and the Internet will give it a new twist. 
Many of the gloomy predictions-and gloomy realities-of the 20th century will be happily left behind. So too, for a while, will be that greatest curse: war between nations. There will be conflicts as some nations break up-in Central Asia and perhaps in Western Sahara, after a referendum on independence in July. But no wars. To be cheerful about 2000 consider only this. Of the 30 major elections that will be held, 16 will be in countries that 25 years ago were dictatorships. There will be four elections to watch. In March, Taiwan will hold an open and free vote; it will expose as humbugs all those Asian autocrats who hold that the East requires a Confucian and necessarily authoritarian (or corrupt) way of government. In July, the Russians go to the polls: an exercise that will prove the futility of democracy at the ballot box without a rule of law in the land. Russia's misery will continue. Look to Mexico on July 2nd. A country that has been a byword for cruelty, chaos and privilege is, not before time, to hold genuinely free elections in a society that is, piecemeal, equally genuinely reforming itself. And on November 7th, there is America's election. Months of scrutiny and campaigning and expense will produce two nearly identical candidates, each of whom will have his views carefully honed to a meaningless average. But lucky America to have evolved a system where leadership leaves its dogmas aside at the winning post. Note that whoever is elected-Democrat or Republican-will be a highly educated man. America's system is easily mocked but it does not produce fools. 
2000 will be a good year for Britain. Its economy will grow rapidly, one of Europe's star performers yet again. This trajectory means that Britain's wealth may overtake that of France for the first time in nearly 50 years. Britain's new-found prosperity comes from its trade with fellow Europeans. It will be a depressing oddity that, for yet another year, public debate in Britain will be dominated by animosity towards its neighbours. Elsewhere nationalism will be healthily relegated to sport. Watch out for the Olympics that start in Sydney in September, if you miss the old tribal certainties of fluttering flags and swelling pride in the home team. 
The World an 2000 is printed in Britain and America. It will appear in 16 languages from Japanese to Greek. Its mistakes, therefore, will be widely disseminated. I hope those things about it that are accurate or entertaining will also be well read and enjoyed. 
Dudley Fishburn  1999 Elections to the White House and the Kremlin will hold the world spellbound, predicts John Parker. Each will produce a marginal improvement. 
In July Russia will elect a new president. On November 7th America will do likewise. These elections mark the passage from the first to the second generation of post-cold war leaders. The two votes could hardly seem more different. One is taking place after eight years of unparalleled economic boom in a country where voters are mostly satisfied with the institutions of state. The other comes after eight years of unparalleled bust in a country where almost every state institution is in crisis. 
Nevertheless, there are links, and revealing ones. Both Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have concentrated on their domestic economies, when they could. Both are ending their presidencies in scandal and disgrace. In both cases, their successors will have to inch their way towards a new international engagement. 
Russia's election is the more uncertain and the more constrained. Whoever wins will want to be a vigorous new broom: more interventionist at home, more aggressive abroad, harder to deal with all round. But at the same time, he will be hamstrung by Russia's enfeebled system of government, its corrupted economy and the calamitous condition of its armed forces. In practice, therefore, the year will see a struggle between the assertive ambitions of the new president and the ruinous realities of the country. This will be unnerving for everyone, Russians most of all. 
The American election is less explosively disruptive. 2000's election is exceptionally open. There is a chance that all three elected institutions of government might change hands. That has not been true for generations. Despite the years of prosperity, the presidential race will be close-far closer than appears from opinion polls. But Republicans have captured seven of the past 12 presidential elections. With the Democrat administration tainted by scandal, they are better placed to win back the White House than any time since 1980: the race is George W Bush's to lose. 
The House of Representatives is also likely to change hands. The Republicans' popularity is abysmal. They are defending the narrowest majority since 1951 (six seats)-and there are at least 30 close races. The Senate, where the Republicans have a majority of ten and are defending only half a dozen open seats, is less likely to change hands. But even here, a strong swing towards the Democrats would be enough to change control. In short, you could have almost any combination of outcomes: a continuation of the current division of government (Democratic president, Republican Congress); the mirror image; or unified government under either party. And as if that were not enough, it is unlikely that anyone will win well enough to dominate either chamber. This leads to the firm prediction that there will be more of the sort of gridlock that has characterised American government for the past few years. This need not be a weakness. There are no urgent matters in American life that require political solutions or sustained leadership. And the American public is too diverse, too splendidly kaleidescopic, to be led by some political or moral dogma, as the Republican right is learning to its cost. (Russia, by contrast, could well fall far such a shallow appeal.) 
The recent huge surpluses on the federal budget have fundamentally altered American politics: they mean there are no dire economic consequences from failure to agree on spending measures. All that happens as a result of gridlock is that the national debt is repaid faster-a desirable outcome. At home, gridlock matters little. But abroad, it matters more. The next ten years are likely to be a time of greater international instability than the past ten. The new Russian president is one reason for that, Chinese assertiveness another, nuclear proliferation a third. Then there is the unending rash of small conflicts that will require American attention and perhaps military intervention. While there is a broad public consensus that the United States should exercise some sort of leadership role in the world, there is no agreement on individual hard cases. This means the new president will face tougher choices, without a popular mandate for any particular action and, very possibly, without much support in Congress. There would be every reason to lament this muddle if the past ten years had not shown that a muddled America can still act swiftly and benevolently-something that will be long denied to a corrupt and bankrupt Russia, whoever its leader might be.  1999 America's slowdown will need to be balanced by growth elsewhere. Financial markets are unprepared for this, warns Clive Crook. 
Not for many years has the fortune of the world's biggest economy seemed so detached from conditions elsewhere. The United States continues to roar along. Early in 2000 it will set a new record for its longest uninterrupted economic expansion. You might have expected this breathless growth to help other countries: when America works up a sweat, as it were, the rest of the world gets a fever. Not this time. Europe, Japan and much of the third world have been growing only slowly of late. The global economy is weirdly out of joint. 
In the coming months this growth imbalance will start to be corrected. One thing is as clear as anything can be in the economic predictions business: the American expansion is going to cool. What is unclear is how abrupt the slowdown will be, and whether it will be offset by faster growth in the rest of the world. Could the braking be so severe as to drag the world back into recession? The odds are against it-but the risk is not to be dismissed. 
To many American economic commentators, this will seem a much-too-gloomy assessment. The recent mood in the United States has been triumphant, and understandably so. Growth in 1999 as a whole will come in at close to 4%, which is remarkable in the eighth year of expansion. But that is not the best of it. After nearly a decade of growth, the unemployment rate has fallen to barely 4%-yet there is no obvious sign, so far, of rising inflation. Many analysts suppose that this stunning performance will continue indefinitely. This year Wall Street raised its valuations of American corporations to levels that make sense only on that very assumption. The old rules say this cannot be right. Of course they do, reply the optimists, but the old rules no longer hold: the revolutions in computing and telecommunications have repealed them. 
Even if such exuberance is justified, the view that growth in America can continue for ever at its present rate is foolish. Suppose that the ""new economy"" is real; suppose that the long-term trend of growth in productivity is markedly steeper than before, thanks to advancing technology. Even this would be too little to sustain the American miracle. The reason is that inflation in the United States has been suppressed in the past couple of years by temporary factors-by those useful imbalances in the world economy, in fact. 
Europe's turn 
Slow growth in Europe and severe recessions in much of the third world have been a blessing in disguise for the United States. They created global spare capacity, pressing down on prices. Oil and other commodities have been dirt-cheap for most of the past two years, reducing consumer-price inflation in America by as much as a full percentage point a year during 1996-98. And sluggish demand outside the United States has also enabled America to finance its current-account deficit (reflecting its excess of investment over saving) at low interest rates and without a depreciation in the dollar. 
Now that demand is picking up in Europe and Asia, both of these special price-suppressing factors will fade: the cost of inputs will rise, and financing the deficit is going to call for higher interest rates or a lower dollar, either of which will push prices up. This is to say nothing of pressure for higher wages, which is also sure to mount (at the present very low rate of unemployment) unless growth cools. So if the economy fails to slow spontaneously, inflation will start to climb; and if inflation starts to climb, the Federal Reserve will have to brake the economy deliberately by raising interest rates. 
For these reasons, American growth will need to slow soon even if the ""new economy"" is real. Nonetheless, the more truth there is to the view that productivity growth has improved, the milder this slowdown will need to be. If the optimists are right about the new supply-side revolution, a soft landing both for the economy and for Wall Street is a pretty safe bet. The trouble is, the evidence so far suggests they are wrong. Growth in American labour productivity has improved in the past two years, as the optimists never tire of pointing outbut this improvement has been entirely concentrated, so far at least, in one small sub-sector of the economy (namely, rc manufacturing). Perhaps productivity growth will improve across the board in the years to come: it has not done so yet. 
This has two disturbing implications. The first is that the slowdown necessary to avoid inflation breaking out in the United States in 2000 will be noticeably large. The most recent iMa forecasts (which do in fact allow for some modest supply-side improvement) show growth slowing by more than a full percentage point, to 2.6%; even so, inflation drifts gently upwards. As it stands, that looks like a soft landing-though Wall Street in its present mood might find it something of a shock. Which brings us to the second worrying implication. If the new economy is a mirage, or anyway much less real than it has been made out to be, then present stockmarket valuations of American companies are indefensible. Once you combine the need for a cooling of aggregate demand with a stockmarket that is both overvalued and seemingly unprepared for even the mildest disappointment, you have the necessary ingredients for a much less graceful touchdown. 
In the past year, the world economy has had a lucky escape, and America's magnificent economy deserves the credit. As economies flagged around the globe, America kept the wheels of global commerce turning. Now a grand rebalancing is needed. If the world's luck holds, the coming year will see gently slower growth in America, a curbing of passions on Wall Street (but no crash), all combined with increasing strength in Europe, Japan and the emerging markets. It could happen-but don't bet more than you can afford to lose.  1999 Muslims will in the 2000s demand and win the freedom that their leaders have long denied them, predicts Brian Beedham. 
With fingers only lightly crossed, it is possible at the close of the 1990s to hope that the decade's biggest geopolitical ogre can now be laid to rest. Since the end of the cold war, with a ruined Russia and a China that still does not quite know what it wants to do in the world, too many people have been willing to believe that the next great danger to global peace and freedom would be the rise of a ferocious new Islamic superpower. As things stand, that looks increasingly unlikely. 
The two major Muslim countries where revolutionary Islam had seemed most dangerous, Iran and Algeria, are in different ways-one much better than the other-probably at last getting it under control. Even in remoter patches of chaos such as Sudan and Afghanistan things no longer look quite as bad as they once did. And, tighten those crossed fingers, quite a few Muslim countries have lately been making their first hesitant experiments with the idea of democracy. 
In Iran, once thought of as the epicentre of the clerical earthquake, something new is happening. A relatively free election in 1997 gave the Iranian presidency, by an overwhelming majority, to the liberal Muhammad Khatami. The ""supreme leader"" who stands above the president, the veteran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, then proved much less intransigent than had been expected. The ayatollah has helped to get Iran back on speaking terms with much of the Arab world and with Europe, and has let President Khatami extend at least a tentative hand of reconciliation towards America. 
The struggle in Iran is not over. Ayatollah Khamenei remains more conservative than President Khatami; liberal newspapers can still get shut down; February's parliamentary election will show whether Iranians can vote as freely in 2000 as they did in 1997. Yet something has changed in the past few years. A middle ground has opened up between the most unbending of Iran's religious fanatics and the irreconcilables at the other end of the ideological spectrum. 
Something similar has happened in Algeria, though in a different way and far more Moodily. The savage civil war which began in 1992, when the army insisted on cancelling an election that a relatively moderate Islamist party looked like winning, seems to be grinding to a close. The army has more or less got on top of the brutally extremist guerrillas the war inevitably created. But the army, or at least its better part, has also been shaken by the war-by the huge casualty list, by the atrocities its own men have committed, by the damage done to the economy, and by the disapproving stares of Algeria's neighbours in Europe. The generals have therefore decided to let the politicians begin a dialogue with the more flexible Islamists the army had spurned in 1992. 
There are new flickers of light in other dark corners. Sudan's Islamists have suddenly accepted the principle of a free press, and have sent a small smile towards the country's exiled opposition. Even the Taliban regime in Afghanistan-the fundamentalists so narrow-minded that even the other fundamentalists noticed-shows some signs of rational thinking. 
The improvement is not confined to the parts of the Muslim world run by religious zealots. There are signs that Jordan and Morocco may grow more liberal under their young new kings; in the Gulf, little Kuwait, Qatar and Oman are letting more people vote, and vote more freely, in their elections; and on the other side of the globe huge Indonesia is currently digesting the consequences of its first real attempt at letting the people choose who will govern them. 
Add what may be the most telling fact of all-that the countries of the Muslim world, even the single-- language Arab part of it, have made virtually no progress towards real political solidarity over the past 50 years-and that nightmare of a pugnacious new Muslim superpower can be seen for what it is: the sort of bad dream you wake up from, shaking a puzzled head. 
The reality is less frightening than the dream for two reasons. The first is that ""the Muslim world"", though united by more or less the same religious beliefs, is otherwise divided into a dozen separate cultures and sub-cultures. Arabs are different from Turks, Turks from Persians, Persians from Pathans, Pathans from Punjabis, Punjabis from Bengalis, Bengalis from Malays and the Muslims of Indonesia. Even the 22 countries that share the Arabic language remain distinct political entities, held apart by disruptive variations of economics and history and by their rulers' desire to keep a grip on local power. It will never be easy to construct a potent international force out of so loose a club. 
The other part of the explanation will make it even harder. Like everybody else, today's inhabitants of all these assorted countries know far more about the rest of the world than their parents did, thanks to the electronics revolution of the late 20th century. The effects are an awkward mixture of envy and distaste; but for most Muslims, poor and unfree, the envy will probably be the stronger. They will increasingly want a richer and freer future than is likely to be provided either by religious puritans or by corrupt army-backed dictators. 
Until now, few Muslims have been able to use their individual judgment about anything. Except for the handful recently made rich by oil, most of them have always lived in rural or pastoral poverty; being poor, they have been easily kept under the heel of dictatorial rulers; above all, the interpretation of Islam-of God's will-has long been the monopoly of a handful of selfselected wise men who believed they knew what others should think and do. 
Now, the economics of the modern world offers an escape from poverty. One group of Islamic revivalists is urging that all good Muslims should have an equal voice in the interpretation of God's will. If individual judgment can be used in religion, it will surely be used in politics too. The same sort of change, for rather similar reasons, began in the Christian world half a millennium ago. Look forward to a Muslim Reformation. 
Brian Beedham: associate editor, The Economist.  1999 The British economy may soon overtake the French, for the first time in a generation, predicts John Grimond. Don't take it too seriously. 
Few rivalries provide as much entertainment for onlookers as that between France and Britain, or rather between their peoples, the Frogs and the Rosbifs. They do not hate each other, as some neighbours do. But nor do they love each other. Each admires certain features of the other: cuisine, chic, paysage on the one hand; dogs, literature, phlegm on the other. But the qualities they respect in each other are far outweighed by those they despise. 
And hence their rivalry, a rivalry made all the more intense by what the two countries have in common: a similar sense of nationhood, a similar proud history, a similar claim to a role on the world stage, a similar diminution of that role, a similar size of population and a similar size of economy. It is this economic similarity that will ere long excite feelings of superiority (among the Brits), derision (among the French) and perhaps amusement (among others): some time in the not-toodistant future, headlines in British newspapers will triumphantly proclaim that Britain's gross domestic product has overtaken France's. 
The claim will be phoney, but never mind, it will have numbers to support it. They will show that when the value of French GDP, measured in euros, is converted into dollars, it is smaller than that of Britain's GDP, measured in pounds and then also converted into dollars. Calculated this way, the two economies are indeed about the same size already: France's GDP was $1.4 trillion in 1998, Britain's $1.37 trillion. Though the French economy has been growing nicely in 1999, at about 2.3%, and is set to do even better in 2000, the euro has been weak and the pound strong. 
The British newspapers that will trumpet Britain's new economic prowess most loudly will be those that also fulminate against the Eu and especially its latest piece of ""integrationist lunacy"", the single currency. Yet if the claim that Britain's economy has overtaken France's can be made at all-and it should be pointed out that, in the foreign-exchange markets, no future event can ever be considered certain-then it will be a claim that can be made only because of the euro. In other words, had it not been for horrible economic and monetary union (so ruthlessly promoted by the diabolical Frenchman, Jacques Delors, when he ran the European Commission), Britain's economy would still be unambiguously behind France's. 
That is where it is, on any sensible reckoning, and where it is likely to stay, at least for a while. To compare economies by valuing them at market exchange rates can give an utterly misleading picture. Exchange rates vary wildly, and are influenced by factors such as interest rates, capital transfers, government policy and so on, not merely by pure international trade. That is why inter-country comparisons are usually based on the concent of purchasing-power parity, which values currenties in terms of how much is required to buy an identical basket of goods and services in the countries concerned. On this reckoning, the British economy (at $1.30 trillion in 1999) is about 4.5% smaller than the French one ($1.37 trillion). 
However, even this calculation may well be inaccurate. In all countries, plenty of economic activity, from building and baby-sitting to prostitution and drug-dealing, goes unrecorded. It is conceivable that, if all of this were taken into account, Britain's economy might turn out to be genuinely bigger than France's. 
Conceivable but unlikely. It is widely believed that it was a decision to include the underground economy in the official figures that lay behind il sorpasso, Italy's celebrated, yet shortlived, overtaking of Britain back in 1987. But the underground economy is almost certain to be larger in a highly taxed and highly regulated country, such as France, than in a laisser faire country such as Britain. 
But does size matter? Since the two countries' populations are virtually the same-France's is smaller by less than half a million people, unless the overseas departments are included-a bigger economy means bigger GnP per person, so the French are, on average, richer than the Brits. This will not come as a surprise to the millions of Britons who go to France for their holidays each year. They may not be able to see that the French have more telephones and more washing-machines, or even that they have lower infant mortality and deaths from cancer. But they can hardly help but notice that the French have swankier clothes, smarter trains and proportionately more cars. Competitive Brits may, however, take comfort from the latest Human Development Report issued by the United Nations. In 1999, its annual ""human development index"" put Britain ahead of France for the first time. So there.  1999 The Spanish-speaking world is acquiring a style, sophistication and influence that, says Daniel Franklin, will affect all our lives. 
Starting in 2000, would-be American presidents will be at a dangerous disadvantage unless they can appeal to voters in Spanish as well as in English. Hispanic-Americans are growing rapidly not only in numbers (31m and rising) but in confidence and clout as well. Beyond the United States, too, the Spanish-speaking world, which extends across more than 20 countries in three continents and includes over 350m people, is set to become a force to be reckoned with once again. Prepare for a new breed of cultural and commercial conquistadors. 
This may sound implausible to those who have come to take inexorable Anglo-Saxon pre-eminence for granted. A crude but credible view of the Hispanic world's history is that, after Spain's imperial power peaked, it has been downhill for much of the past 400 years. As the Spanish-speaking world's influence declined, that of the English-speaking world rose, carried ever higher first by the British empire and then by America. Even now, it would be easy to look at the troubles of Latin America and conclude that it is too early to talk of a turn in fortunes. You will see guerrilla insurgency (Colombia), debt default (Ecuador) and economic recession (much of South America). Swathes of Spanish-speaking countries are still desperately poor and plagued by high crime. In too many of them, scant regard for the rule of law holds back development. 
Yet look again, and you will see that many of the pieces are in place for a powerful Hispanic resurgence. One of the pieces is democracy. All but one of the Spanish-speaking countries are now democracies of sorts, the exception being Fidel Castro's Cuba. Democracy, of course, is no guarantee of good government. But it is an improvement on dictatorship. The countries with the deepest democratic roots, from Chile to Costa Rica, tend to have the strongest civil institutions. 
Next, there is trade. The inward-looking, import-substituting model of economic development having failed, Latin Americans have sensibly abandoned it. They have opted instead to open markets and enter into trade-liberalising agreements, whether with one another (Mercosur, the Andean Community, the Central American Common Market) or, in Mexico's case, with its North American neighbours. Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico's economy has boomed with America's. 
Hip, hip, Hispanidad 
In the United States itself, it is demography that is giving Latinos a lift. By 2050 the country's Hispanics may number as many as 100m, perhaps a quarter of the population (compared with 11% now). Today's Latinos are young and proud of their roots. All of a sudden, Hispanic is hip, from musica to movies, from la vida Iota to Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek. The influence is spreading beyond the obvious Spanish-speaking areas: hence the popularity of salsa clubs across Europe and the enthusiastic crowds for Ricky Martin in London. An upwardly mobile ""Generation N"" (the Latin equivalent of Generation X), which was invented and copyrighted by a Miami entrepreneur, is starting to flex its muscles. 
The final piece of the puzzle lies across the Atlantic. Since the end of the Francoist dictatorship in 1975, Spain, too, has swapped dictatorship for democracy and opened itself to the world through its memberships of NATO and the Eu. It is reaping the rewards. A foundermember of the single currency, it is now in Europe's super-league, gaining in wealth, weight and prestige. The centuries-long downward trend in Spanish fortunes has turned sharply upwards. Newly confident, Spaniards are increasingly looking not just to Europe but beyond, to Spain's former colonies. 
All this creates a potent mix for Hispanidad. Companies can expand their horizons across the continents. There will be a growing number of Spanish-accented multinationals, both spreading from Spain (like Telefonica, a telecoms giant, Repsol, an oil company, and Banco Santander Central Hispano) and from Latin America (like Mexico's Cemex). Publishers and Internet adventurers will flock to exploit an increasingly enticing Spanish-speaking market. Spanish speakers themselves will start to wallow in the attention and spread their influence far and wide-through trade, music, family values, and Spanglish words that enter into common usage-like true children of Columbus. Before long, the world will realise that globalizacion is a Spanish word.  1999 JANUARY

Compiled in association with The Economist eCalendar Companion. Software to personalise your electronic diary. wvu.bookshop.economist.com  1999 On Tuesday November 7th, America will probably follow Mae West's dictum: ""When forced to choose between two evils, I pick the one I have not tried before."" A full year of campaigning, in which none of the serious protagonists is anything but decent, responsible and colourless, will have left American democracy dull but in good shape. America's tedium will be the world's respect. 
Two parts of the American system, however, are going seriously wrong. First, despite all the hoopla, only around half of America's population will vote (compared with 72% in British and 95% in Australian elections). The winner will be lucky to have the backing of 25% of the public, and so will have no firm mandate. When the electorate is so little involved it is no wonder that new presidents enjoy so little popular loyalty or goodwill. 
Second, the election will produce, once again, a Congress that will soon find itself at odds with the White House. A recent poll showed that only 14% of the electorate wanted a divided government. The 2000 elections definitely give voters the opportunity to try a new arrangement: to have both the White House and Capitol Hill in the hands of the same party. Control of Congress is up for grabs. In the House, the 26-seat Republican majority installed in 1994 has dwindled to just five. In the Senate, Republicans have held a 55-45 advantage since 1994 and are favoured to retain control, but Democrats have at least a mathematical chance to take over. Yet these numbers disguise the truth: Capitol Hill has evolved into an institution that can define itself only through its arguments with the White House, regardless of which party has nominal control. 
Not so the Supreme Court, where change is also afoot. Three of the justices are over 70-Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor. With a fourth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, having undergone surgery for cancer, the prospects are that the next president will be able substantially to reshape the judiciary. More than 70 other federal judgeships are vacant and unlikely to be filled before 2001 owing to conflicts between the president, who nominates judges, and the Republican Senate, which must confirm them. (The political hijacking of the appointment process is another troubled element in the constitution that needs sorting out.) 
The presidential election campaign has been under way for most of 1999 owing to the decision of several states to move their primary elections to the early months of 2000. A majority of the delegates to both national conventions will be selected by March 15th. 
Among Republicans, it would take a cosmological intervention to deprive George W Bush of the nomination. He is 30 points ahead of any rival in national opinion polls. He has the support of a majority of his fellow Republican governors and of members of Congress. And he has collected three times as much in campaign contributions as his nearest rival, billionaire magazine publisher, Steve Forbes. The only suspense on the Republican side is whether Mr Bush will somehow stumble. 
The Democratic contest, on the other hand, has become intense, with the front-runner, Vice-President Al Gore, strongly challenged by a former senator, Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Mr Gore is both blessed and cursed by his eight years as Bill Clinton's loyal vice-president. He is blessed because he has cemented ties with powerful Democratic interest groups, because Mr Clinton will use the powers of his office to help him and because, if the American economy stays strong, Mr Gore will be seen as part of a winning team. 
But Mr Gore is cursed by the fact that the Clinton presidency has been stained by multiple scandals. The public seems anxious to move on to cleaner pastures. As the joke goes, ""After Clinton, the United States wants to take a shower, and poor Al Gore is going down the drain."" Mr Bradley, a former professional basketball player who spent 18 years in the Senate, has based his challenge to Mr Gore on two arguments: that he is not an ""inside"" politician and that he will address problems-child poverty, the 45m who lack health insurance-that he alleges the Clinton-Gore administration has neglected. 
Despite Mr Bradley's progress, Mr Gore retains institutional advantages in the nomination struggle. It will take 2,189 delegate votes at the August Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles to win. The party reserves 18% of those ballots for ""super-delegates""-governors, members of Congress and members of the Democratic National Committee, who are free to vote as they wish. They are overwhelmingly in Mr Gore's camp. The other 80% are awarded according to state primary results. 
Along with the presidency, separate races will be under way for House and Senate seats. (Watch out for Hillary Clinton's run for the New York Senate seat.) Congressional Democrats, with help from the White House, have paid almost exclusive attention to winning back control of the House by framing issues, raising money and recruiting candidates. The most contentious issues arise from the inability of a divided government to pass major items on the national agenda-Social Security and Medicare reform, tax reductions, gun control or patients' rights legislation. 
There will be two other important twists to look for in the 2000 elections. First, the governors and state legislators in office over the next few years will redraw electoral boundaries in the wake of the decennial census, possibly handing an advantage to one party or another for the next decade. Second, these elections will be the first in the world in which the Internet will play a crucial part. All the tricks of democracy-from policy initiatives to character assassination-will move on to the net.  1999 For the past couple of years, America's economy has basked in luck. It has grown robustly, while a combination of low commodity prices and a strong dollar have kept inflation out of sight. Foreigners' willingness to pour capital into America has funded the spending spree. In 2000 this luck will be severely tested, since the economy is beset with two big weaknesses: stock prices are too high and savings are too low. These problems pose a nasty threat to the country's nineyear expansion. A market crash would leave bubbly consumers feeling suddenly less wealthy: spending would plummet, and so would the economy. 
The fear of that kind of ""hard landing"" will give rise to some anxious moments in 2000. But although the economy will slow from a gallop to a trot, and although the stockmarket and the dollar will show some humility, the chances are that America's luck will hold. There will be no Armageddon on Wall Street, no dramatic dollar crisis, no collapse of consumer spending, and certainly no recession. Unless Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, makes some grave errors, America's economy has every chance of achieving a ""soft landing"" as it slows to a more sustainable pace. 
Two related factors will force a slowdown from the near record growth rates that have been the recent norm: foreigners and fears of inflation. Foreigners have been bankrolling America's recent spending spree. While the rest of the world looked in turmoil, investors were happy to pour their money into America's booming markets. As a result, the country's current-account deficit-which reflects the difference between how much America saves and invests, and is funded by capital inflows from foreigners-has ballooned. 
In 2000, this deficit will reach nearly $400 billion, or 4% Of GDP, a record level, higher than that of the Reagan boom of the mid-1980s. However, after 2000 the current-account deficit will slowly fall. Foreigners will see improving opportunities for their cash elsewhere in Japan and Europe, and they will worry that America is using their capital to finance low savings rather than booming investment. As a result, they will start to shift their money elsewhere. Scarcer capital in America will mean higher interest rates; growth will slow. 
America's mind-boggling consumer spending (which has jumped by an average of 5% in 1998 and 1999) has been fuelled by a huge fall in personal savings. As their stock portfolios have fattened, Americans have felt wealthier and saved less. In 1993 households saved around 7% of their disposable income. By 1999 the figure was barely above 2%. Were this decline to continue, Americans would soon be spending more than their disposable income. Clearly this trend is unsustainable, which is why 2000 will see much slower growth in spending, thus slowing overall growth some more. 
As foreigners shift their money to other economies, the dollar will fall. A weaker dollar will boost America's exports (export volumes could grow by over 8% in 2000, more than twice as Fast as 1999). Import growth will slow, as foreign-made products become relatively more expensive in dollars. But a weaker dollar will also aggravate fears of inflationary pressure, which will be rising anyway for other reasons. 
The spectacularly benign performance of prices-consumer-price inflation is near 30-year lows despite booming demand-has a variety of causes. In part it is due to increases in the productivity of American workers; in part it is the result of lucky breaks such as falling commodity prices and the strong dollar. But the dollar's weakness in 2000 will carry the threat of higher prices in the shops; so too will higher commodity prices. At the same time, the cost of labour may pick up. By early 2000 the unemployment rate will be pushed below 4% and the scarcity of workers will eventually push hourly wages upwards. 
If inflation suddenly accelerates, the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates sharply, popping the bubble on Wall Street and bringing about the hard landing that investors fear. But the likelihood is otherwise. 
Even so, tight labour markets, a weaker dollar and firmer commodity prices will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term interest rates modestly. The result will be higher costs for borrowers throughout the economy. This in turn will trigger a gentle slowing in spending and investment, together with a modest and overdue correction to the excessive prices on Wall Street. And yet, even as America slows down, American triumphalism will remain undented. By accomplishing a soft landing, America will have pulled off a miracle as remarkable as the past years of unbroken growth. 
Zanny Minton-Beddoes: Washington correspondent. The Economist. 
United Nations subscriptions go up for Japan and down for America, though it still owes $1.2 billion. Is Uncle Sam world policeman or a free-rider?  1999 America's pockets will feel the weight of change in the early months of 2000, when a new dollar coin is placed in circulation. The coin, which is set to replace the rarely seen Susan B. Anthony dollar, will once again be graced by the figure of a woman. Unlike her predecessor she'll be a native American. On the obverse side of the coin will be the figure of Sacagawea, the Shoshone teenage mother who travelled from the Northern Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean with the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1805. Strapped to her back will be her son, Jean-Baptiste. The design marks a radical departure from the harsh profiles of previous American presidents. Despite the failure of the Susan B. Anthony coin, which remains in use only for vending machines, the us mint is confident that the Sacagawea coin will succeed. With its distinctive gold colouring and smooth edge, it is expected to be popular in the pocket. It will not be possible to confuse it, as the Susan B. Anthony coin could be, with the nickel. And there is a widespread feeling that the single dollar bill has become too bulky and difficult to pocket. Its face value is too low for a paper note. Few other wealthy countries have such small units of currency expressed in paper. So, does this mean the demise of the dollar bill? The government certainly intends to give wide circulation to the new coin as it will cost less to maintain and will last longer than the paper note. This time the betting is that the dollar coin will take hold. While in this reforming mood, how long will it be before the one-cent coin is phased out?  1999 In 1790, the United States became the first modern nation to undertake a comprehensive count of its population as a routine responsibility of government. The constitutionally mandated decennial census was part and parcel of a revolutionary concept in government. If the new nation's democratically elected governments were to be truly representative of the people, then the government itself would have to make regular efforts to determine just how many of those people there were. 
Whereas the Senate was established to represent the interests of the states, the House of Representatives was designed to represent the interests of individuals. The Constitution dictates that every decade a census be used to apportion representatives among the states according to the relative size of their populations. 
From the very beginning, the American nation has been characterised by rapid population growth and movement. Hence the census has as much to do with political power shifts as it does with population shifts. With so much at stake, the census has always been a magnet for controversy. George Washington was unhappy with the first ever count of the American people. (He thought that it was too low.) True to tradition, the 2000 census, which will be conducted on April 1st, will be greeted with grumbling from all sides. 
Indeed, over the past few years the 2000 census has been shaping up as the most contentious since 1920, when rural lawmakers refused to reapportion House seats based on data showing that more Americans lived in cities than in the countryside. On the surface, contemporary Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over methodology: whether the Census Bureau should employ sophisticated statistical sampling techniques or an old-fashioned head count. 
But the real battle has been over who will be counted. Despite its $2.6 billion price tag, the 1990 census was a debacle, leaving an estimated 10m people uncounted, many of them members of Democratic-leaning minority groups. To avoid repeating such a massive undercount in 2000, the Census Bureau had been advocating the use of sampling-a process whereby 90% of people are physically counted and the remaining 10% are statistically inferred. Hoping a higher tally of minorities would help them create new friendly political constituencies, the Democrats championed the bureau's cause, but to no avail. 
Citing the Constitution-and not so secretly wishing for another undercount-the Republicans opposed sampling. They demanded the actual (and perhaps impossible) enumeration of every person in the country. A former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, went as far as to call sampling a ""dagger pointed at the heart"" of the Republican majority and filed suit against the government to stop it. The Supreme Court ruled in his favour and ordered the Census Bureau to conduct a traditional enumeration. 
Therefore it is a foregone conclusion that the 2000 census will vastly undercount the American people. Despite a scheduled $100m national ad campaign to ""make everyone count"", Americans of all stripes will duck census counters out of a distrust of government and a growing concern for privacy. 
The variety of recent immigrants means that language barriers will pose significant challenges to the Census Bureau in 2000. Nonetheless, the new data will reveal a nation that is becoming more racially and ethnically complex than ever before. In the 2000 census, America will be more heavily Latino than it was in 1990. And in part due to the anti-immigrant fervour in the first half of the decade, more immigrants will be naturalised American citizens than ten years before. 
Yet, even while documenting the diversification of the American people, the 2000 census will also mark the beginning of the end of America's archaic official racial accounting scheme. 
In 2000, for the first time, Americans will be able to identify themselves as multiracial. While not necessarily the best solution, the Census Bureau will nonetheless allow respondents to tick any or all of the four primary racial boxes: African-American, white, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native. In the past, the Census asked respondents to pick only one of the above categories. (Hispanic remains a separate ethnic-and non-racial-classification.) 
The multiple-race option came after three years of emotional public debate between multiracial activists and traditional minority civil-rights groups. The Clinton administration rejected a proposed self standing ""multiracial"" category that would have included all people of mixed racial background. 
Lobbied hard by ethnic advocacy groups that feared the diminishment of their constituencies if a multiracial category had been approved, the White House stumbled on the multiple race option as a political compromise. Census 2000 will acknowledge multiracial Americans even while upholding the old classifications. 
However modest, the change in rules will affect policies like affirmative action or the drawing of minority legislative districts. But the most long-lasting consequence of the new census form is likely to be administrative confusion. It is not at all clear how the multiracial data will ultimately be used. Will the daughter of an African-American father and a white mother be considered black when state legislatures are attempting to forge black-dominant political districts? And what about a citizen who says he is a combination of black, Asian, and white? Will the government consider him all or none of the above? 
Despite the steady increase in Asian immigration to the United States, the 2000 census might very well count fewer Asian-Americans than in 1990. In a 1996 test run, 30% of Asian-American respondents identified themselves as multiracial. 
And although the Census Bureau does not expect many Americans to tick more than one box in 2000-past policy has encouraged people to choose one heritage over the other-multiracial Americans will increasingly make their presence felt. Since 1970, the population of multiracial children has quadrupled in the United States. Between 1960 and 1990, the number of once-illegal unions between races increased 900%. In contemporary California, one in every six births is a mixed-race child. However flawed, the 2000 census will officially mark America's new found freedom not just to acknowledge its past, but also its future heritage.

Imagine: planes flying above cities beaming down radio, video and data communications. Experiments begin in 2000 that might give satellites a run for their money.  1999 Yachting's grandest trophy, the America's Cup, will be up for grabs in a series of nine races off New Zealand starting on February 19th. This cup always brings out wallets, egos, national pride, skulduggery and skill. Just to enter you have to post a $250,000 bond. But this is nothing compared with the cost of developing a yacht and professional team, which is upwards of $35m. Yet no less than 11 syndicates will have their keels in the water, representing six countries: France, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. (Note the shameful absence of Britain, which founded the competition in 1851 but then repeatedly lost it.) The cup has been won away from the United States only twice, the first time in 1983 by Australia and the second time by New Zealand in 1995.  1999 Americans will reach deep into their pockets in 2000 and give $200 billion to charity. This will not just be an unprecedented amount; it will be more than all the other 5.8 billion citizens of the world put together will donate. Britain, which does not think of itself as a mean-spirited country, will give just over 44 billion ($6.4 billion). 
Americans give to charity for many reasons. The first and foremost of them is that they are a generous and civic-minded people-words that many other countries find hard to say. There are secondary reasons: the tax system encourages philanthropy, not because it is lax but because it is wise. There is a recognition that individuals give more shrewdly than the state. In Britain, by contrast, the state believes that it alone should be bountiful-and the recent arrival of the national lottery, whose earnings are, in part, allotted to charities by state-appointed bodies, illustrates the point. Since the lottery began, personal giving in Britain has declined. In the past 20 years the proportion of households in Britain giving to charity has declined from 34% to 29%. 2000 will see Britain giving less, in real terms, than five years ago. 
In the United States giving will surge. The two most popular beneficiaries will be religious organisations (they will receive nearly $80 billion) and educational charities, notably universities ($28 billion). But the fastest-growing charities will be the wildlife organisations and those concerned with protecting the environment. America's huge personal wealth is a guarantee that this trend will continue. Many of the country's older millionaires will choose not to pass all their money on to their already rich and middle-aged children. And many of California's computer millionaires actually feel that it is morally wrong to do so. This is a trend that will gather pace in the years ahead-but not outside America.  1999 Eight short centuries ago, in the summer of 1212, many thousands of children, most of them boys around the age of 12, set out from France and the Rhineland to reconquer the Holy Land by the force of their love. The children fared miserably, but some adults did rather well: many of the relatively few young crusaders who got as far as Italy were captured by merchants and sold into slavery. The episode may be worth recalling as a new children's crusade, of a different sort, gathers force in America. 
In 1996, few people noticed when the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Cancer Society spent $30m to establish a new activist campaign. The National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, as it was called, opened a fresh front in what it called the ""war on tobacco"". The new breed of activist noticed that most smokers first pick up a cigarette when they are minors (16 years old, on average). Never mind that 16 is not most people's idea of a ""child"", and that most teenagers who try cigarettes soon drop them: by concentrating on smoking and ""kids"", the activists thought, they could change the tenor of the public debate. 
So it was that anti-smoking campaigners characterised smoking as a ""pediatric disease"", and tobacco merchants as predators upon the young and helpless. The children's crusade against tobacco was not, by itself, decisive, but it went far to create the political climate that produced a settlement, in late 1998. Tobacco companies will now charge American smokers more for cigarettes while furnishing $246 billion-a fortune by any reckoning-to state governments, lawyers and anti-smoking campaigners. 
Humbug for all 
This success in 1998 was not lost on others in 1999. The supporters of stricter controls on guns in America-like the anti-smoking activists-had long been stymied by the political ferocity of their opponents and by the public's philosophical qualms about restricting law-- abiding adults' access to legal goods. In 1999, after several horrific episodes in which boys committed mass shootings in schools, activists began portraying guns as specifically a threat to children. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president's wife, reflected the tone when she proclaimed: ""Guns and children are two words that should never be put together in the same sentence."" 
In fact, children (meaning adolescents, mainly) and guns have mixed comfortably in America for many years. A study for the American Justice Department has reported that young people who are given guns and taught to use them are less likely to commit crimes, including crimes involving firearms, than are young people who lack access to guns. The problem in America is not children and guns, but adults and guns. Turning the argument into one over ""kids"" did not, in reality, have as much to do with the welfare of children as with the ambitions of adults. 
In August 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency> America's main environmental regulator, announced its first restrictions intended speciFically, the agency said, to protect children. The link between the restricted pesticides and children was not altogether convincing: children eat more fruit and vegetables than adults (so the argument went), and their bodies are still developing, so pesticides would hurt them disproportionately. 
At about the same time, a report issued by congressional Republicans called for new measures restricting and otherwise discouraging violence in films, television shows, music and other media of mass communication. This, too, was pitched as a children's crusade. ""We must now devote ourselves"", said the report, ""to reducing the amount and degree of violence in our media and to shielding our children from such harmful depictions."" 
If 1999 saw the formula for children's crusades refined to a science, 2000 presents boundless opportunities to generalise its application. For example: 
Al Gore, Bill Clinton's vice-president and would be successor, hopes to move towards a broad national health insurance-succeeding where Mr Clinton failed-by promising health care for all children. 
As 2000 approached, Congress was considering seven bills-such as the ""Children's Protection Act,"" the ""Children's Defense Act,"" and the ""Protection of Children from On-Line Predators and Exploitation Act""-to regulate the Internet in the name of children. 
Firearms regulation, newly a ""kids""' issue. will heat to a boil as the lawsuits that dozens of states and cities have brought against gun manufacturers move: to trial. 
In the longer term, the repetition of ""Protect the children!"" as a rallying cry for activist adults spells its own undoing. Usually, however, gimmicks succeed for a while before ennui sets in. That should make 2000 a good year for campaigners of all stripes to see how many causes can be sent through the American legislatures and courts on the backs of innocent children. 
All change on Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest, will become a forprofit business with its own stock listing. Shares will be quoted in decimals, not fractions.  1999 Robert Rubin, former secretary of the United States Treasury, gives warning that conventional wisdom is not a good guide to the future. 
There are two widely accepted ideas concerning economic matters in the years ahead. First, that there are powerful new forces at work-especially globalisation and the technology of the information age-that are creating immense change at a rapid pace and that this constitutes a new paradigm. And, second, that financial markets and market-based economics have replaced dirigiste economics and relegated government to a relatively minor role in economic affairs. 
Having spent 26 years on Wall Street and six-and-a-half years in government, living all of these changes first-hand, I believe that each of these statements is both powerfully right and powerfully wrong. 
Clearly, barriers to capital and trade flows have greatly decreased; the movement of capital, as well as goods and services, across borders has greatly increased; and technology is advancing rapidly and in profoundly important ways. The result seems almost surely to be significant productivity improvements, especially in America, though the official numbers do not yet appropriately show them and some of the claims being made may well be excessive. All of this holds great promise for the economies of all nations that are open to change and to trade, and that have sound policies in areas ranging from fiscal discipline to education. 
However, there are increasing numbers of commentators who extrapolate from all of this the idea of a new paradigm that is thought to lead to unprecedented conclusions with respect to business cycles, market valuations and the like. They are advocating a modern-day version of the famous thesis set forth in 1928 by Irving R. Fisher, a noted Yale economist, that we have reached a ""permanent plateau of prosperity"". 
I share the view that economic change is producing great benefits, and that the improved understanding of economics should lead us to better responses than the monetary and fiscal policies in the years following the 1929 crash. But everything I have experienced suggests that, at core, economic conditions and markets are grounded in the human psyche. That is, confidence or the lack thereof profoundly affects markets and economies, and confidence in turn has throughout the history of markets and economies tended to swing from excesses in one direction to excesses in the other. 
Perhaps the commentators are right and this is no longer operative, for the first time in human history. But the alternative is also possible. And our actions should reflect that alternative possibility. Public policymakers must continue to work intensely at the longterm project of reforming the architecture of the global financial markets. Private-sector managers must do what the private sector never does during good times: identify and weigh risks appropriately in decision-making. My impression is that the long period of good times in the industrial nations, and the rapid recovery when markets faltered, in 1987 and 1998, have dulled concern about risk. 
Another important piece of the great change taking place is the move towards market-based economics and away from dirigiste economics. This has led many commentators to say that financial markets, trading markets and the market-based economy have become so much more powerful than governments that public policy matters relatively little. 
There is no question, in my view, that government efforts to determine market prices in opposition to market forces cannot prevail over any period of time, and there is no question that global financial markets have become a powerful disciplinary force with respect to fiscal discipline, and monetary and other policies. 
On the other hand, that is only part of the story. Government still has a critically important role: different but no less important than the central planning and state ownership roles of yesteryear. 
We need governments 
Government must perform the functions that markets by their nature cannot or will not perform optimally, and these areas provide the underpinnings and framework for the market-based economy. Economists capture this idea with concepts like externality and market failure. Examples are public education, environmental protection, national defence and social safety nets. Of course, government can also mismanage, as by undue regulation, or by unsound fiscal or monetary policies, and that can be highly damaging. 
A critically important debate for the years ahead will be where this line between what markets do and what government does should be drawn. And this debate will be about not only what functions government should be involved with, but also, when government is involved, to what extent government should perform a given function itself and to what extent it should provide incentives or subsidies for the private sector to perform that function. School vouchers, private-sector prisons, trading markets in pollution rights, are good examples of battlegrounds in this debate in the United States. 
So, the more things change, the more things stay the same, in the sense that in the final analysis markets are about human beings and human nature. We should act to realise fully the potential for good in these powerful changes, but we must also eschew complacency and, in both the public and private sectors, realistically appraise risk and act accordingly. We must also allow market forces to operate where they can maximise our well-being, but support the government in performance of its critically important role. 
The future of the global economy is most promising, but to realise that promise the public and private sectors must act wisely on many fronts, sometimes in conflict with the conventional wisdom of the moment. the ambitions of adults. 
In August 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency, America's main environmental regulator, announced its first restrictions intended speciFically, the agency said, to protect children. The link between the restricted pesticides and children was not altogether convincing: children eat more fruit and vegetables than adults (so the argument went), and their bodies are still developing, so pesticides would hurt them disproportionately.

This, too, was pitched as a children's crusade. ""We must now devote ourselves"", said the report, ""to reducing the amount and degree of violence in our media and to shielding our children from such harmful depictions."" 
If 1999 saw the formula for children's crusades refined to a science, 2000 presents boundless opportunities to generalise its application.

Firearms regulation, newly a ""kids""' issue will heat to a boil as the lawsuits that dozens of states and cities have brought against gun manufacturers move to trial. 
In the longer term, the repetition of ""Prefect the children!"" as a rallying cry for activist adults spells its own undoing. Usually, however, gimmicks succeed for a while before ennui sets in. That should make 2000 a good year for campaigners of all stripes to see how many causes can be sent through the American legislatures and courts on the backs of innocent children.  1999 In 1986 the price of oil plummeted from $30 to $10 a barrel, and Texas quaked in its oversized boots. Businesses went under, cities became virtual ghost towns, and oil men cut down their prime rib consumption at Houston's posh Petroleum Club. In 1998 oil prices once again tumbled through the floor, yet the Lone Star state barely noticed, having branched out from its monogamous relationship with oil towards one with software and semiconductors. It's not just Texas. Throughout America's south-west and mountain region states that were once at the mercy of commodity prices have undergone a high-tech revolution, creating thousands of new jobs and transforming themselves into America's new technological hubs. It is now the fastest-growing region in the country, and in 2000 it will flex its muscles, finally emerging as a political and economic powerhouse, which the two coasts can no longer ignore. 
While a booming economy lifted all American boats during the 1990s, the rising tide was perhaps most beneficial to the interior West region. The region led the nation in job creation and personal income growth during the decade, as cities such as Denver, Austin, Boise and Salt Lake City, once sleepy and regionally focused, emerged as global centres for telecommunications, software and biotechnology. By embracing new technologies, the region has stabilised its economic base, no longer the victim of boom-and-bust cycles in industries such as oil, copper and silver. It is now home to high-tech powerhouses such as Dell, Intel, USWest and Compaq. Technology companies will continue to move into the area in 2000, taking advantage of the region's low tax, pro-business climate. 
Another reason for the economic surge can be seen at the 37 border crossings between the United States and Mexico. The elimination of trade barriers after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 has brought a rapid expansion of trade between the two countries, with all of the new commerce flowing through the American south-west. According to Philip Burgess, president of the Denverbased Centre for the New West, NAFTa has created a ""border economy"", growing 10% each year, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean, with border areas in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Southern California joined in an economie alliance with northern Mexico. 
Fueled by new industry and a burgeoning job market, the region has experienced the fastest population growth during the 1990s, with almost 21% growth during the decade compared with the national rate of 9%. Of the 25 fastest-growing cities in America in 2000, 15 are located in the interior West. The Census Bureau predicts the booming growth will continue well into the 21st century. This growth is far from evenly spread, however, as the vast majority of the economic and demographic expansion has been in the cities. In Arizona, 80% of the state's (largely technology based) job growth is in the Phoenix area-evidence of what many experts see as a problematic ""digital divide"" in the region. 
The changing demographics are partly due to what Marc Perry of the Census Bureau calls the ""All the way there, half the way back"" phenomenon, That is to say, easterners who migrated to California and have become disillusioned with the state's urbanisationand for some, with California's growing Latino population-have sought new frontiers in the interior states. This demographic shift will benefit the region politically in the census, as six of the nine congressional seats expected to migrate as a result of the census will go to the interior West. More people means more money, as federal funds to the states are determined by census estimates. 
In addition to increasing its presence on Capitol Hill, the region will have a significant impact on the presidential election, having developed into the most solid Republican block in the nation. Despite predictions a decade ago that diversified economies in the west would attract more eastern liberals to the region, population growth has not altered the region's traditional conservatism, long fuelled by scepticism of federal government and regulation. The Republican Party now holds 14 of the region's 18 Senate seats, and all nine of the governors' mansions. 
In an attempt to boost the region's clout over the presidential nomination process, several western politicians pushed for an early ""Big Sky"" primary in 2000, in which the western states would all hold their primaries on the same day, as the southern states do on Super Tuesday. It failed, so most of the western states will now hold their primaries too late in 2000 to have an impact on who earns the two parties' nominations. On election day, however, the impact will be unmistakable. The betting is that all nine states will vote for the Republican nominee in November 2000. 
Mark Mazzetti: south-west United States correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Americans will look on with seeming carelessness as their political system appears to be hijacked in 2000 by the power of money. They will know perfectly well that their democracy is being distorted by vast payments of cash from ""special interests"". They will accept with insouciance the most cynical view of politicians selling their souls and votes to the highest bidder. But they will convey little sense of urgency to their elected representatives of the need to fix the role of money in elections. And they will place campaign-finance reform near the bottom of their ranking of domestic public policy priorities. 
The political elites are likewise in no hurry to mend things. Saturation press coverage of fund-raising scandals during the 1996 presidential election and a deluge of emotional newspaper editorials since then have been insufficient to embarrass Congress into patching the most gaping loopholes in current law. 
Political financing has already become a major focus of newspaper reporting during this election cycle. The phenomenal early fundraising success of George W. Bush, the Texas governor, drew the spotlights. (He raised $37m in the first half of 1999, almost three times the previous record.] His subsequent decision to forgo public matching funds (making him only the third candidate to reject the public money that has been available since 1974) was the signal political event of the pre-primary presidential campaign. A close second was how easily Bill Bradley, a former senator, raised $12m in contributions. This has immediately made him a credible challenger to Vice-President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. 
Both parties have announced that they hope to raise over $200m for their non-federal or ""soft money"" accounts. These funds have the virtue of being able to receive donations from corporations or trade unions that would otherwise be prohibited; and there are none of the limits on the size of contributions from individuals that apply to federal or hard money accounts. During the 1996 and 1998 elections, the parties discovered ever-more creative ways of spending soft money, thus craftily avoiding the restrictions embedded in federal campaign finance law. 
Campaign-finance reform will get more attention because two presidential aspirants, John McCain, a Republican senator, and Mr Bradley, have made it centrepieces of their campaigns. Mr McCain's decision to scale back his reform bill, by abandoning efforts to regulate election-oriented ""issue"" advertisements but retaining the ban on soft money, was not sufficient in the autumn of 1999 to garner the 60 votes needed to end the Republican filibuster and pave the way for some changes in the law. But it will provide a platform for Mr McCain and his allies to try to shake the public from its lethargy. Even in the unlikely event that those efforts were successful and the current Congress enacts campaign-finance reform, it would be too late to have any effect on the 2000 campaign. 
The prominent role of political money hardly makes America unique among the world's democracies. The experience of other countries in grappling with these problems suggests that the rules of political finance are important but secondary in shaping democratic accountability. Indeed efforts to deal with it have often yielded disappointing results. Scandals have arisen in many countries before and after reforms were adopted. Levels of corruption are not strongly related to the extent of public subsidies or the intensity of regulation of party and campaign finance. 
Idealism or reality? 
This is not a counsel of despair. It is a brief for realism. There is a tension between the reality of economic inequality and the ideal of political equality. Political parties and candidates for office need money to compete successfully in elections. Relatively few citizens have the personal means or desire to contribute to political campaigns. Under these circumstances, efforts to prevent concentrations of wealth from undermining political equality may conflict with freedoms of speech and association. The challenge in future will not be to eliminate the tension altogether but to manage it better. 
In the case of America, that means first of all restoring credibility to campaign-finance laws, some enacted as long ago as 1907, that have in recent years been shredded beyond recognition. First eliminate soft money and restore the long-standing prohibition against political financing from corporate and union treasuries. More controls on election-oriented ""issue"" advertisements would sharpen the transparency of campaigns. Adequately funding the account for public financing of presidential elections would avoid a repeat of the embarrassment of 2000 when the Treasury will be unable to meet its legal obligations to match the private contributions of presidential candidates. 
Beyond these immediate but critical fixes, reformers will continue to wrestle with slowing the money chase. They will want to foster the participation of small donors and grass-roots organisations. They will call for an appropriate role for political parties in campaign finance that does not relegate them to mere instruments for money-laundering. But these reforms will fail to balance the interests at stake. In short there seems to be no alternative to muddling through-which is exactly what will happen. 
Thomas E. Mann: W. Averell Harriman Senior Fellow in American Governance, the Brookings Institution.  1999 Hollywood will turn its gaze upward to the heavens and forward to the future. Two of the biggest blockbusters of 2000, both due out in March, will examine bids to colonise the most fashionable of planets, Mars: Walt Disney's ""Mission to Mars"" and Warner Brother's ""Red Planet"". In ""Space Cowboys"", another Warner Brothers film, ""a bunch of old guys"" led by Clint Eastwood venture into outer space, while in ""Titan AE"" (Fox), a teenager goes in search of a spacecraft that can save the world. Steven Spielberg reheats an old Philip K. Dick science-fiction story, ""Minority Report"", about a judicial system in which potential murderers are arrested before they can do any harm and, in its third sci-fi blockbuster of the year, ""Battleship Earth"", Warner Brothers succeeds in finding a new backdrop for John Travolta. 
Hollywood's other great inspiration at the millennium will be the past. Two of the best historical blockbusters for years will be Sony's ""Patriot"", a CivilWar epic starring Mel Gibson, and DreamWorks' ""Gladiator"", directed by Ridley Scott. Miramax is capitalising on its successful ""Shakespeare in Love"" with souped-up versions of Hamlet, Othello and Love's Labour's Lost. (The studio has wisely avoided overstraining the public's appetite for doublet and hose: Kenneth Branagh has turned ""Love's Labour's Lost"" into a 1950s musical.) 
The history that Hollywood is happiest with, however, is its own. Disney opens the year with 
""Fantasia 2000"", with seven new pieces set to music, including one by Shostakovich, and closes it with ""102 Dalmatians"". There will be sequels to ""Mission Impossible"" (which, if we are lucky, may explain what was going on in the first film), ""Beavis and Butthead"", along with ""Scream 3"" and a prequel to the Flintstones series. Those quintessential 70s figures, Shaft and Charlie's Angels, will return. Hollywood is also making yet another attempt to revive the musical, not only with ""Love's Labour's Lost"" but also with ""Moulin Rouge"", starring Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. 
There will be the usual rash of adaptations of best-selling novels. Mr Spielberg will lay a practised hand on ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", George Clooney will wrestle with the ocean in ""A Perfect Storm"" and Leonardo Di Caprio will discover that a Thai paradise is not all it is cracked up to be in ""The Beach."" 
The most unexpected development of the year will be Hollywood's loveaffair with hairdressers. In January, Warner Brothers will release ""The Big Tease"" (motto: ""he came, he coiffed, he conquered""), about a gay Glaswegian hairdresser who takes on the Los Angeles hair establishment. (The studio is showing the film to hairdressers before its official release, on the grounds that nobody is better placed to generate word-of-mouth publicity.) Later in the year Miramax will release ""Blow Dry"", the story of the rivalry between two hairdressing salons in a small town, written by the author of ""The Full Monty"". 
Adrian Wooldridge: West Coast correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Canada is arguably the world's most successful country: year after year it tops the United Nations' Development Index. But year after year-and 2000 will be no exception-it becomes a little more like the United States. (It is, after all, slightly less wealthy than California.) Indeed Canada's politicians will spend the coming months promoting themselves with an enthusiasm seldom seen north of the border. They may not outdo their electioneering colleagues further south, but open displays of political ambition are hardly what Canadians have come to expect from their leaders. 
The prime minister, Jean Chretien, tired of being underestimated by friend and foe alike, will strive for a place in the history books alongside more flamboyant predecessors such as Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney. The opposition leader, Preston Manning, will risk his leadership of the Reform Party with continued attempts to forge a nation-wide coalition with the Progressive Conservatives (the ""United Alternative"") against Mr Chretien's Liberals. Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec, will be tempted yet again to put to a referendum the question of the secession of his francophone province from the anglophone rest of Canada. 
Mr Bouchard has talked of calling a referendum only if there are ""winning conditions"", but until the wording of the cuestion is defined, these ""conditions"" will also remain conveniently undefined. Most francophone Quebeckers suspect they will never get the respect they deserve from their anglophone compatriots, but does that mean they will vote to leave Canada? Most polls suggest that they want to have their gateau and eat it: they flirt with secession but worry about its consequences, and so prefer, in the end, to avoid it. 
Throughout the coming year politicians will be indulging their ambitions just as Canada's economic outlook, so robust at the end of the 1990s, takes on a less favourable aspect. As growth slows in America, so it will in Canada too. The question is how painful the slowing will be. Roughly a third of GDP consists of exports south of the border. In other words, if and when the American economy sneezes, the Canadian economy will catch a cold-especially in Ontario, whose exports to America account for two-fifths of its GDP. 
All of which means that in politics, 2000 will be a frustrating year, especially for those talented Liberals, the finance minister, Paul Martin, for example, and the Newfoundland premier, Brian Tobin, who reckon they, not Mr Chretien> would make better prime ministers. Partly to quieten the rivalry, Mr Chretien has promised to lead his party into the next election, and this need not be until June 2002. Although many analysts reckon that Mr Chretien will use the millennium as a graceful way to bow out early, why should he? After all, he rather enjoys living at 24 Sussex Drive, the Ottawa residence that comes with the job. With the economy slowing, the politicians posturing more than normal and the Quebec issue once again in the headlines, some Canadians will feel their 21st century is getting off to an inauspicious start, not least because unemployment, around 8% for most of 1999, will start to edge up again. 
Yet behind the headlines the reality will be more promising. The competitive spur of NAFTA and the reforming instincts and fiscal rigour of Mr Martin (no respecter of the Liberals' wishy washy tradition) mean that the country's balance sheet will still look remarkably healthy. Canada will be the only G7 country other than America to be in a financial surplus-and that surplus will apply not just at the federal level but also in most of the provinces. Moreover, the effects of America's slowdown will be mitigated (especially for British Columbia) by a recovery in Canada's Asian markets and, at some point, a rise in oil and commodity prices. 
The difficulty will be to persuade Canadians to keep up the good work. The slimming of the public sector will lead to more outbreaks of industrial unrest, such as the 1999 nurses' strike in Saskatchewan, and more worries for the future of Canada's universal health-care system and its publicly financed schools and universities. Yet at the same time Canada's businessmen, conscious that they cannot hide forever behind a weak currency, will clamour for lower taxes. 
And rightly so if Canada is to staunch the ""brain drain"" that flows south each year in the form of thousands of well-educated professionals. Ironically, the greater the flow, the more determined most Canadians-from the prime minister on-will be to distinguish themselves from Americans. (One flow that may stop in 2000 is the flow of Canada's water to some states in America. This is certain to cause a row or two.) 
In some ways this will be an exercise in futility: Canadians watch the soap operas of America's television rather than the worthy offerings of the publicly owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; and they regard recognition in America, not Canada, as the mark of business, sporting or artistic success. 
Yet at the same time, with a defiant glance southwards and regardless of their interprovincial squabbles, they can justly celebrate Canada's many strengths. These include a disproportionately large contribution to international peacekeeping; a sense of social compassion; and a belief that as a nation of immigrants Canada is better served by a policy of tolerant ""multiculturalism"" than the ""melting pot"" notion to which America pretends. 
As more and more of their companies are bought by American investors, Canadians will try to make sure that what is Canadian by nature remains that way. If Ottawa's politicians can be confident about Canada and not defensive, then the country will remain truly distinctive from its neighbour for many years to come. 
Wild salmon will make their last Atlantic run. In 1975 there were 800,000 of these noble fish: 25 years later there will be an unsustainable 20,000. 
John Andrews: correspondent for The Economist, now based in Paris.  1999 Beset by growing social instability, a faltering economy and heightened tensions with Taiwan and America, China will hardly be in a mood to celebrate what it had hoped would be a year for trumpeting the successes of its ""socialist modernisation"". 
Although 1999 was symbolically important in marking the 50th anniversary of communist rule in China, its leaders have long attached even greater importance to 2000 as a target date for achieving key development goals such as the elimination of poverty and the eradication of illiteracy among the young and middle-aged. But it now seems likely that the significant progress that China has made towards achieving these goals will be overshadowed by a host of other problems, some of them threatening the party's survival. China's successful rush to capitalism will demand ever greater freedom that the Communist leadership will be reluctant to give. 
China's leaders will be glad that their bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games in Beijing was narrowly defeated by Sydney. They can look forward now to a year unencumbered by major international events or sensitive anniversaries. They will be relieved to see the back of 1999a year in which they pulled out every stop to ensure social stability during a string of potentially troublesome dates, including the 10th anniversary in June of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests and the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. But the leadership cannot afford to relax. 
The end of 1999 will focus more attendon on a problem that has bedevilled the Communist Party for the past 50 years: the status of Taiwan. Following the return of the Portuguese-administered territory of Macao to Chinese rule on December 20th 1999, the entire Chinese mainland, for the first time since the Ming Dynasty, will be under the control of a single, indigenous government. In Beijing's view, Taiwan will thus become the last remaining holdout in China of an administration that professes no allegiance to the Communist Party. 2000 will be a year of crisis in relations between Beijing and Taipei. 
Storm clouds began to gather over the Taiwan Straits in July 1999 when President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan declared that his island's relations with the mainland should be treated on a ""stateto-state"" basis, thereby brushing aside the longstanding etiquette whereby both sides would say there was but one China. President Lee will stand down in March 2000 at the end of his maximum two terms in office. Beijing will anxiously await the outcome of the resulting presidential election. 
China's handling of the Taiwan issue will have a considerable impact on the volatile relationship between Beijing and Washington. America's presidential election in November 2000 will aggravate tensions, as candidates vie to demonstrate their readiness to deal firmly with Chinese transgressions. President Bill Clinton himself has warned of the danger of a ""campaign-driven cold war with China"". 
Beijing too is heading for a period of heightened political uncertainty as the Communist Party prepares for leadership changes at its 16th Congress in 2002 and at the following year's annual session of the parliament, the National People's Congress, when Jiang Zemin will be constitutionally obliged to step down as head of state. The man to watch in 2000 will be Vice-President Hu Jintao, a colourless technocrat being groomed by Mr Jiang for the presidency. The question is whether Mr Hu will also take over Mr Jung's more crucial post as Communist Party chief, or whether the country is heading for another Deng Xiaoping-style gerontocracy with Mr Jiang-already 73-clinging on into his dotage. 
Anyone aspiring to take over from Mr Jiang as party general secretary would be a brave person indeed. The party is becoming an unruly body. The ""Three Stresses"" campaign to restore ideological, political and moral rectitude among party members will not stop the rot. The root cause of widespread corruption and ill-discipline within the party is that many of its members have little sense of where the leadership is taking them or what their future will be in a country undergoing rapid change. The coming year will inevitably see numerous new cases of top level wrongdoing coming to light. 
It would certainly take a leader of extraordinary vision to steer the country through its economic difficulties. In 1998 Zhu Rongji, the prime minister, called for the fortunes of loss-making state-owned enterprises to be turned around by 2000. Though dubbed China's ""economics tsar"" by his western admirers, Mr Zhu has made little obvious headway. In an effort to revive the economy, Mr Zhu might well try devaluing the currency, the yuan, sometime in 2000. But it is far from clear that this would revive consumer confidence and halt the crippling deflationary spiral that has beset the country since late 1997. 
But it may not be all gloom for China's leaders in 2000. One event that could boost morale is the launch of the country's first manned space vehicle. This would make it only the third country after Russia and the United States to put a person into space. The intended message to the outside world would be that for all its problems, China is a major power with the expertise to match the West in the century to come. 
James Miles: senior Chinese affairs analyst, BBC news.  1999 First the good news. The turmoil that has surrounded the Japanese government ever since disgruntled voters threw the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) out of office in 1993, after 38 years of unbroken rule, is finally coming to an end. The Japanese people still do not believe that the Liberal Democrats have abandoned their venal ways. But they prefer the probusiness conservatives-especially when it comes to sorting out the country's financial and economic woes-to the squabbling ideologues of the opposition. Above all, they prefer to see the LDP in power but kept firmly on a leash, forced to govern through a coalition. 
In the general election that must be held before October 2000, the Japanese people will renew the Lnr-led coalition's mandate for another four years. They may even grant the Liberal Democrats an increased majority in the 500-seat lower house of the Diet (parliament). But there is absolutely nothing that the ruling party can do about its shortage of seats in the upper house for at least two more years-and quite possibly for a further five years given the chamber's distorted demographics. For the foreseeable future, therefore, Japan will be run by a coalition of conservative forces-the LDP plus the hawkish Liberal Party and the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. 
Now for the even better news: 2000 will see Japan, if not quite its old self, at least economically back on its feet again. After suffering its worst recession in living memory-prolonged by the miscalculations of political leaders and compounded by bungling, foot-dragging and denial on the part of the country's once-lauded bureaucracy-Japan should experience real growth of 2% during 2000, with possibly as much as 3% in 2001. This turnaround in Japan's political and economic fortunes owes much to the most improbable of figures. When handed the job by party bigwigs in mid1998, Keizo Obuchi was expected to be no more than a stop-gap prime minister. Pundits gave the uncharismatic leader of the LDP's largest faction months in office at most, as he served out the tail-end of the premiership vacated by the over-ambitious Ryutaro Hashimoto. The Obuchi government currently enjoys one of the highest popularity ratings in ages. And for good reason. The economic turnaround is largely a consequence of actions taken early in the Obuchi government's first term to clean up the country's banking mess and pump liquidity into the parched economy. 
The first glimmer of recovery came between January and March 1999 when the economy surprised everyone by growing by 2%. One by one, embarrassed economists began to revise their gloomy forecasts upwards. Most still believe that Mr Obuchi is a bit optimistic in promising the people that the economy will grow by an annual 0.5% in the fiscal year that ends in March 2000. But the consensus now is that the prime minister will at least be able to claim to have arrested the decline and got the economy growing again. Rather than risk jeopardising the fragile recovery-and alienate voters who will be heading shortly for the voting booths-the Lnr voted last September to give Mr Obuchi a second term. 
A recovery there may be, but that does not mean an end to the pain. Having finally shattered the myth of lifetime employment, Japanese companies will push joblessness-higher nowadays in Japan than in America-to over 6% during 2000 as they slash payrolls and reengineer their businesses every bit as vigorously as American firms did a decade ago. 
Two entirely new factors will keep Japanese managers' feet to the fire in 2000. One is a coming change in bookkeeping. From April, Japanese firms will have to prepare their consolidated accounts according to international standards, forcing them to close loopholes which allowed them to hide losses from their investors and profits from the taxman. Proper consolidated accounting will also reveal the full horror of their pension nightmares. Even among Japan's most respected companies, unfunded pension liabilities are going to be taking large bites out of profits for many years to come. 
The second factor that will make corporate Japan mend its ways in 2000 is the wholly new attitude that has been forced on the banks by their own troubles. Gone are the days when the Ministry of Finance could protect Japanese banks from the worst of their follies by ensuring that even the most incompetent remained profitable. Instead of doling out loans blindly to all and sundry, Japanese banks will henceforth have to weigh up the risks involved in each loan, using alien yardsticks such as a company's return on assets, its corporate strategy, its product development and its market record as guides to its credit worthiness. And bank loans will be priced at internationally competitive rates. Starting in 2000, the cost of capital for Japanese business will go through the roof. The wave of business mergers that will follow could easily send unemployment soaring towards 10%. Fortunately, from 2000 onwards, the hardship will be mitigated by an economy that has begun to grow. 
Nicholas Valery: Tokyo bureau chief, The Economist.  1999 The race to succeed Lee Teng-hui as Taiwan's president will be lively. Taiwan has truly taken to democracy, to the embarrassment of many of its neighbours. The wooden but competent vice-president, Lien Chan, is the official candidate of the ruling Kuomintang in the March 2000 election. The charismatic former mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian, is carrying the flag for the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party. Adding spice is the participation of a former provincial governor, James Soong, who, after falling out with Mr Lee, is standing as an independent. 
Mr Soong is the front-runner but faces a tough race, partly because of his mainlander background. China was angered by the Taiwan government's redefinition in July of cross-Strait links as ""state-to-state"". Any further rise in tensions between the two sides-- caused, say, by Chinese attempts to intimidate Taiwan militarily-would damage Mr Soong, Mr Lien, perceived as a safe pair of hands, would benefit from a rise in tensions with China, as would Mr Chen. Mr Lien will also benefit from the vast finances of the Kuomintang. 
Attempts by China to intimidate Taiwan would drag down economic growth and cause tremors on the stockmarket. In the absence of such distractions Taiwan's GnP, estimated to have grown by 5.5% in 1999, will surge forward again in 2000, fuelled by the exports and investment spending of the island's high-tech manufacturers. 
Look out for the start of Taiwan's state lottery. It will raise $3 billion a year, mostly for new pensions and health. One area of concern is the general government deficit, which was 3.3% of GDP. As a result of the devastating earthquake on September 21st the deficit is likely to rise in 2000. The deterioration will, however, be limited by the government's privatisation programme, when onethird of the largest state-owned enterprise, Chunghwa Telecom, is sold, raising $6 billion.  1999 To judge from the commotion going on, visitors to Okinawa could be forgiven for thinking that the Olympic Games were being staged there this summer. All the construction, preparation and disruption on Japan's most southerly island prefecture is actually for the three-day summit meeting between the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries plus Russia on July 21st-24th. To keep everyone cheerfully loquacious, local distillers of awamori-a rice-based spirit that has been produced in Okinawa for more than 500 years-have formulated a special brew to be served at official receptions. 
Public handouts have been a way of life for Okinawans since the end of the second world war. The chain of subtropical islands, 1,600km south-west of Tokyo> was governed by the American military until it was handed back in 1972. It has remained Japan's poorest and most heavily subsidised prefecture ever since. 
The one big stick locals have for beating the authorities in Tokyo is the fact that, despite accounting for no more than 1% of the Japanese land mass, Okinawa provides 75% of the facilities used by American forces in Japan and accommodates 29,000 of the 47,000 soldiers stationed in the archipelago. So whenever Okinawans feel they need something from the central government, they bring out the ""Yankee Go Home"" signs. It never fails. 
The chance to host the summit was part of a government bribe to get the local community to accept a new site for the huge Futenma helicopter station used by the American marines. No surprise then that it is to Nago-an hour or two's drive to the north-east of the prefectural capital of Naha and its airport-that the leaders of the industrial world will congregate for three days.  1999 One of the remarkable features of Japan in the 1970s and 1980s was that it seemed impervious to goings-on in the outside world. High dollar or low dollar, detente or evil empire, booming Asia or stumbling Asia, Japan just kept rolling on. The 1973 oil shock did knock it over for a year, but it clambered upright more quickly than any other developed economy. It did have to make appropriate foreign-policy noises at appropriate moments to please the Americans, but without any great effort. In 2000, however, it will be acutely vulnerable to events in the outside world. Its fate in the coming few years will depend, more than anything else, on what happens in three other countries: the United States, China and North Korea. 
The reason for this is more than just the banal reality of international interdependence. As the world's secondlargest economy and as Asia's most developed and richest country, you would expect Japan to have more control over its own fate than this. When, in the late 1980s, it looked destined soon to overtake America, it was widely assumed that political power-which, really, means the ability to influence events-would soon follow. It hasn't, because Japan's economy has stagnated for a decade. That stagnation has exposed the inability of any political party to take effective charge of domestic policy. Which, in turn, has left foreign policy dangling in the wind. 
The very thing that seemed to explain Japan's success-that politicians stayed out of the way of bureaucrats and businessmen-has in the 1990s prolonged its weakness. Businessmen became burdened with debts, and throttled by a collapsed financial system. Bureaucrats were discredited by corruption, and by their own initial attempts to lie about the financial crisis in the hope that it might soon mend itself. For once, politicians were needed, to make the hard choices that financial and economic restructuring required, and to restore control over the bureaucracy. By and large, however, they failed to rise to the occasion. 
That was why Japan was hit so hard by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. At the time its economy was just struggling back to its feet, but without having had any proper financial restructuring. So this new blow, which would have bounced off the Japan of the 1970s or 1980s, toppled it back over. Its exports were hit, its banks' bad-debt burden increased, the nervousness of its consumers merely heightened. In 1999, its economy has again been struggling to its feet. But, again, there has not yet been any fundamental reform. So a new financial crisis, especially one sweeping across the Pacific from the United States, would knock it down again. 
Meanwhile, short of any clear political leadership, this rich but vulnerable country is living in an increasingly tense neighbourhood. China, Japan's traditional rival for regional leadership, is going to pass through some sort of economic and thus political crisis as the strains in its fairlyfree-market economy put pressure on its very-unfree communist dictatorship. That will mainly be a domestic affair. But it is bound to have repercussions for Taiwan, which is the cause celebre of Chinese nationalists, especially those in its armed forces. If so, that will affect us all but especially Japan, which has been Taiwan's strongest supporter in the region. 
A new nationalism 
Japanese politicians, particularly in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, are quite hawkish about Taiwan. It is the one topic on which Japan's foreign policy could reasonably be called brave in recent years. Will they remain brave if, in the next few years, China steps up its rhetorical attacks on Taiwan, imposes a blockade or even invades? One cannot know in advance, but it looks quite likely. Domestic economic weakness may even make a hawkish response more probable. Japanese politicians have their idiosyncracies, but in one way, they are similar to their counterparts elsewhere: in the face of trouble at home, they are likely to be tempted by a unifying cause abroad. 
North Korea is the other possible such cause. Already, in 1999, the threat of North Korean missiles suddenly made it possible to break a long impasse over co-operation with the United States in developing and deploying (around 200710) a theatre missile defence shield. The North Koreans are past masters at using brinkmanship as a negotiating ploy. Japan's problem is that the Koreans, to make this ploy work, need to keep coming up with new threats. It is Japan that is the obvious target for such threats, be they from terrorism, or missile tests, or something new. 
The upshot of all this is an apparent paradox. Once-proud, independent Japan enters the 21st century in a vulnerable state, its fate worryingly in the hands of outside forces. The paradox is that this, at last, could well stir the politicians into life, offering them a unifying cause. 
That cause will be nationalism, and much of the Japanese public will be susceptible to it. Is that a scary prospect for the outside world? Nationalism is the sort of brew that can always boil over into something unpleasant. But in today's and tomorrow's Japan, that is unlikely. It is much likelier to be positive: finally waking Japan up to play its proper role as a regional power. 
Bill Emmott: editor, The Economist.  1999 Remember the books that predicted the dawning of an Asian century that would eclipse the western world? Pull them down again. One day it will happen. In another 25 years Asia will dominate more than half the world's economy. By then the financial crisis that began in 1997 will be seen as no more than a downward blip in a long period of sustained growth. Instead of the decade of gloom that many feared lay ahead, East Asia will be bouncing back in 2000. Some of the tigers will again roar. But the sound they will make will be different, and in many ways more frightening to westerners. 
The shocks to the financial and business environment over the past three years have been so enormous that the region's economies will not resume all of their old exuberant ways. Consumer spending will be the thing to watch. It accounts for more than half the region's economic activity. Increases in consumer spending will show that the recovery is sustainable. But the details will be important. Although some people will be splashing out on new Mercedes-Benzs and Gucci handbags, much of the growth in spending will come from more modest purchases that reflect an end to the belttightening. People will want to do up their homes, replace worn out domestic appliances and perhaps take an overseas holiday. These are mostly things put off for the past two years. 
So growth will be tempered and might top out in 2000. One of the most important factors is that many East Asians remain worried. Two generations have grown up only ever knowing their incomes grow. Now they have experienced declining standards of living, or even unemployment. This has come as a shock and, as Asia recovers, many will be cautious. They will not borrow so much money-especially in foreign currencies-or invest so haphazardly. Caution, the result of hard lessons, is not necessarily a bad thing in the short term. 
Of course some people will desperately cling to the worst features of Asian business: a lack of transparency with too much cronyism and corruption. This is why there are good reasons for caution. Many problems have been hidden. This is particularly so with bust banks and debt-laden companies that have not restructured or closed down. The cracks have simply been papered over in the hope that, as the good times return, the difficulties will not seem so large and may even fade away all together. Some banks and firms will be unable to keep up the pretence. Companies that have put their houses in order will provide increased competition and attract the most interest from local and foreign investors. This will put more pressure on problem firms, and some will fail in 2000. 
The tremors from the banking world will be particularly strong. Many banks are still sitting on frightening amounts of bad loans which, even in improving economic conditions, are never likely to be repaid. One reason for this is that the speed of the recovery has meant that tougher bankruptcy provisions planned by some governments have not been fully implemented. If companies cannot be easily wound up, their debts pile up and their assets cannot be put to use by others. Scandals, wrangling over who is to blame for past problems and political interference will also continue to take its toll on the Asian recovery. 
Meanwhile the chant of reformasi, the rallying cry of the Indonesian students that brought down President Suharto in May 1998, will echo around the region. Indonesia, the giant in SouthEast Asia with a population of 200m, will continue on the path to democracy under its new president, Abdurrahman Wahid. As East Timor struggles to become an independent nation, it will stir fears about a break-up of the sprawling archipelago. Politicians from some of Indonesia's neighbours, in particular the generals who run Myanmar, will try to present the problems facing Indonesia as evidence that only strong governments work in the region. This view will sit even more uneasily with a group of increasingly democratic and open governments led by South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand. 
None of these headwinds will be lost on Singapore, which proved to be one of the most resilient economies throughout the crisis. Although it is virtually a oneparty state, Singapore's leaders have well-tuned antennae. They will liberalise the island's economy even further and try to attract higher-value industries. At the same time, Singapore's leaders will allow the boundaries of personal freedom to be pushed wider than ever before. The reasons go beyond simply allowing Singaporeans to do more before they demand more: the government wants to encourage more entrepreneurial activity, but cannot orchestrate that without dismantling the nanny state. The lesson that Singapore can teach the rest of the region (and also China) is that capitalism has to be an honest system to work. A lack of corruption, transparent accounts, Anglo-American corporate governance-these are the things that will create wealth in Asia. 
Even where democracy has a firm hold people will demand a greater say in running their country. In South Korea, one of the leaders in reform, there will be pressure on the president, Kim Dae Jung, to deliver more accountable government. Mr Kim will have his hands busy battling to reform the chaebol, the conglomerates that have increased their grip on the nation's economy during the financial crisis. 
The one thing that was always true about East Asia will be more true than ever: it is a region of very different economies and policies. This will become more apparent in 2000. Those who have reformed the most will do best. 
Paul Markillie: Asia editor, The Economist.  1999 India enters its 50th anniversary as a republic in high spirits. Its people take pride in having humbled Pakistan in Kashmir, in the stunning success of Indian businessmen overseas, in recent breakthroughs in literacy and population growth, in respectable though not tigerish economic growth and in the slow sloughing off of socialist regulation. Yet they will rightly moan about worsening governance, growing corruption and crime, and shortages of basics like water and electricity. 
The jingoism generated by the confrontation in Kashmir, which flared after Pakistani-backed separatists crossed the ""line of control"" into Indian territory and occupied heights near the towns of Kargil, will resonate in 2000, and keep the subcontinent an area of tension. Expect defence spending to rise officially from 2.5% of crrr in 1999 to 3.0% in 2000 (3.5% if you include some secret purchases). Kargil exhausted much of India's stock of artillery shells, and showed how difficult it was to throw back even a modest number of infiltrators. So India's venal politicians will strike big new arms deals, combining patriotic fervour with lucrative kickbacks. 
Expect the Indian film industry, the biggest in the world, to churn out several movies depicting heroic Indian soldiers thrashing slimy Pakistanis. Expect Pakistan to produce its own movies depicting courageous Kashmiri freedom fighters being gunned down by slimy Indians. Expect the two countries to jam one another's satellite broadcasts of these propaganda efforts. 
According to some official estimates, the billionth Indian was born in 1999. But most demographers believe the event will take place only in 2000, thanks to India's success in slowing population growth over the past generation. Contraception has reduced the birth rate from 48 per 1,000 50 years ago to 27 per 1,000 now, but improved health care has simultaneously reduced the death rate just as rapidly, so for decades the population kept growing at 2.0% per year. However, the death rate is levelling off while the birth rate continues to fall. So population growth is now down to 1.6% annually, and could fall to 1.0% by 2010. 
Expect continuing improvement in literacy too. In 1991, adult literacy was only 52%, well below the level in many African countries. But new political awareness of the importance of primary education has helped the literacy rate to shoot up to nearer 64%. Both the urbanrural gap and male-female literacy gap have shrunk faster than the national average. Education will become a hot political topic in coming years, now that the information revolution is reaching villages through the extension of telecoms and the Internet. 
With the 50th anniversary of India's birth as a republic on January 26th, there will be many long speeches on the country's success in staying democratic in the face of huge strains. Yet critics will say this deserves maybe two cheers but not three. Fifty years ago politicians were viewed as heroes who had won India independence. Today they are viewed as corrupt and criminal. Expect researchers to celebrate the anniversary with fresh data on the number of criminals in the country's many legislatures. (The last estimate, made two years ago by a member of the Election Commission, put the number of criminals at 40 in Parliament and 700 in the state legislatures.) The judicial system is so slow and the police system so incompetent that not a single politician has been convicted of corruption through all stages of appeal. A former prime minister, Narasimha Rao, is still defending a case of alleged cheating in 1984: the complainant has already died of old age. 
When India became a republic, politicians declared that Indians could at last succeed in ways that were impossible under white rule. But today Indians are achieving stunning success not at home, but abroad. Ron Dutta has become head of the world's biggest airline, United Airlines, and Rakesh Gangwal is boss of us Air. Sabeer Bhatia invented Hotmail, the most popular form of Internet based email, and sold it for $400m to Microsoft. Silicon Valley overflows with Indian entrepreneur millionaires. None of these gentlemen would have fared anywhere near as well in India, where talent does not take you far. Fifty years after becoming a republic, Indians are faring better in countries ruled by whites than in their own. Expect politicians to do absolutely nothing about it. 
Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar: consulting editor of the Economic Times, India.  1999 It will be another tense year. The ruling military junta has promised to hold an election once a new constitution is finished, but progress will remain painfully slow. In the meantime, the junta will continue its efforts to smash the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). Tensions will be particularly high in late May, the tenth anniversary of the NLD's 1990 election victory-a result that the military rulers never implemented. Opposition, which comes not just from the NLD but from student, religious and ethnic groups as well, could turn violent. 
But the junta should retain control. It has a vast military and intelligence network, backed by its political wing, the Union Solidarity Development Association. It is unclear how much real support the junta enjoys even within these groups. However, its oppressive tactics have resulted in what the leader of the NLn, Aung San Suu Kyi, has termed a ""blanket of fear"" settling over the country. 
Desperate to break the deadlock, foreign governments will repeat their calls for dialogue between the junta and the opposition. American sanctions will be up for renewal once again in May 2000, and there is also the possibility that the multilateral institutions will again offer to release aid in exchange for steps towards political reform. If the junta grasps the nettle, Myanmar's economic prospects will improve considerably. 
But a change of heart is unlikely. In the absence of reform, efforts to boost agricultural output will be hampered by a shortage of fuel, pesticides and fertiliser, while a dearth of foreign investment will hurt industrial output. The free-market exchange rate will depreciate further. 
Myanmar is a country that, like Cuba and North Korea, has turned its back on the world. As a result it will be 2000's most needlessly miserable country.  1999 When the Queen of England visits Australia in March, she will find that the ex-- colony's recent vote to keep her on as head of state, and not to declare a republic, has left the nation republican in spirit but monarchist in form. The failed vote for a republic was the result of political division (extraordinarily, Prime Minister John Howard advocated a ""no"" vote) and a high level of public disdain for politicians, rather than enthusiasm for the British monarchy. It leaves Australia with a 19th-century constitution. The big debate for the future will be whether, when the matter eventually comes back on to the agenda, Australians should be considering a much more radical model in which the public would directly elect the head of state. 
This political matter aside-and many Australians clearly do dismiss it as mere politics-Australia is in a confident mood. The economy is strong, its recent reforms have cleared the decks for a prosperous few years as Asia's economies recover. And the advent of the Olympic games gives most Australians the feeling that anything the world can do, they can do as well, if not better. 
The general mood of confidence has its shadows, and these come mostly from abroad. The chaos of nearby Indonesia and the Australian intervention in East Timor have caused immediate concern to Mr Howard. Suddenly defence policy, on which spending had fallen to well below 2% of GDP, has become an issue. A bigger defence spend will mean less money for other priorities if the coalition wants to preserve the healthy budget surpluses that have been the pride of the government, elected in 1996. 
Australia's relationship with Indonesia, the cornerstone for decades of foreign policy, has deteriorated sharply, as both the government and the Labor opposition elevated East Timor from the bottom to the top of their international priorities. Bipartisan pragmatism had dominated relations with Indonesia; suddenly policy is getting a ""moral"" base. This new foreign policy will be dramatically and possibly dangerously tested if the fears of the pessimists are realised and Indonesia starts to break up, with parts such as Irian Jaya pressing for their independence. 
Australia enters the next century economically prosperous and confident. Despite dire predictions, it survived the Asian economic crisis with scarcely a scar. Economic restructuring in the 1980s and early 1990s-financial-sector reform, reducing tariffs and privatisation-will stand the country in good stead for 2000 and beyond. It is now inclined to lecture the Asia region on economic and financial rectitude. Growth continues to be strong; unemployment remains around 7%: only a few years ago it was 11%. 
In mid-2000 a new goods and services tax will begin operating. If the government wins the 2001 election it will have made dramatic tax history, having won an election (1998) on the promise of a new tax and then survived to tell the tale of implementing one. Now decisions are being made on a major overhaul of the business tax system-including reducing capital-gains tax and the company tax rate-to attract extra international capital, especially venture funds. 
There is a mood of optimism in the nation. Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games and the 2001 centenary of the six states joining in a federation will make for two years of world attention and local partying. The only other time Australia hosted the games was the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Then, too, Australia was on a high, enjoying post-war prosperity and building a booming economy on a wave of migration. Now migration is at a low level, but Australia has become a truly multicultural nation, with the ""White Australia"" policy long abandoned, and with Sydney and Melbourne having large Asian communities. 
The raucous and racist One Nation Party, which signified the deep discontent of regional Australia in 1998, will have faded to a minor group by 2000. But the rural areas still feel squeezed and politically alienated, as population and services have drained away from the bush. Primary production, traditionally a big slice of Australia's wealth (especially export wealth) has become riskier. Australia has a touch of the two classes about it, based on geography. 
And on race. The plight of many Aborigines is the national shame, with blacks having high levels of infant mortality and shorter longevity than the general population. Too many Aborigines live on welfare. There are some bright spots: the increasing number of Aboriginal graduates; the election of Aden Ridgeway, an Aboriginal senator; and at the games, the nation's heart will be with Aboriginal athlete Cathy Freeman. 
Michelle Grattan: chief political correspondent, Sydney Morning Herald.  1999 After the corruption scandal that surrounded Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Olympic movement can count itself lucky that the sports-mad Australians will do everything in their power to ensure that the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (September 15th-October 1st) will be a success. One million Australians have already bought tickets. They can expect the 2000 Games to be a superbly organised, highly photogenic event, which will draw a worldwide television audience of 3.5 billion. 
By Olympic standards, the completion of Stadium Australia in the Sydney suburb of Homebush, over a year before the opening ceremony, was unprecedented. Once the Olympic flame finally gets to Sydney after its travels around the Pacific region, the stadium will be packed to its 110,000 capacity. In Atlanta 1996, the gold medal count was, United States: 101, Germany: 65, Russia: 63, China: 50, Australia: 41. As hosts, Australia will again excel, conforming to the formula for home success that is one part inspiration, two parts state injection of finances into sport. Australia is the most successful sporting nation in the world, if you measure its results against its 19m population. Sydney 2000 will act as the stage for established stars such as the women's 400m gold prospect Cathy Freeman and newcomers like the 16year-old wonderboy Ian Thorpe, who has a chance of three swimming medals. Watch out for the triathlon, though the swimming leg may be less exciting now that the authorities have guaranteed that there are no sharks in Sydney Harbour. 
Expect stirring performances from the Greeks where athletics has improved greatly since they won the Olympic bid for Athens in 2004. In the javelin, Mirela Manjani-Tzelili and Kostas Gatsioudis are stars in the making. Conversely, China has scaled down its athletic efforts since its rejection as host for 2000, but should at least achieve one ""track"" gold in the 50km walk. 
American sprinters and African distance runners will provide the classic excitement. The United States sprint trio of Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones in five events (100m, 200m, long jump, and the 100m and 400m relays) will peak in Sydney. Ms Jones intends to go for a record five to better Karl Lewis's record of four sprint golds at Los Angeles 1984. She has already endeared herself to crowds everywhere and will be the face of the games. 
In the men's middle and distance events, the North and East Africans will carve up the medals between them. Classy Kenyan runners are plentiful and would win any long-distance relay race, but don't bet against the constantly improving Hicham El Gurrouj of Morocco in the 1,500m and the peerless Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie in the 10,000m. For students of Olympic history, however, the place to be is at the rowing regatta, where the British oarsman Steve Redgrave, this time in the coxless fours, will be vying for his fifth gold medal in consecutive games, an unmatched achievement in any Olympic sport. 
Sydney's best advertisement is in the number of athletes who will decide to seek residence in the country. Already, four young Romanian wrestlers in Sydney for an Olympic test event have claimed asylum. Olympic officials say they are powerless to prevent athletes from trying to stay in Australia: ""The security fence at the Olympic Village is to keep people outnot to keep athletes in."" 
Matthew Glendinning: freelance sports and business writer.  1999 The Middle East enters the new century with the mould of the past generation cracking, if not yet breaking. Long years of Arab-Israeli conflict, involving five major wars since the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948, may now be drawing to an end, following the election in Israel of Ehud Barak and the relaunch of the regional peace process. A generation of Arab rulers-autocrats to a man even if their despotism has occasionally been benign-has started giving way to a new one, more susceptible to change and less burdened by the failures of their fathers. 
So why is there so little optimism to be found in the region? Mainly because no Arab country has lost its fear of, and innate hostility towards, Israel. This includes Egypt and Jordan, which have peace treaties with the Jewish state that emerged in their midst just over half a century ago. Paradoxically, only among the Palestinians-the people with most reason to resent Israel-can one find significant numbers of people who react with equanimity towards the Israelis. But Israelis themselves are in the main still deeply suspicious of Arabs in general and their Palestinian neighbours in particular. 
All this will be held mercilessly under the spotlight in the coming year. During that time, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) have undertaken to reach a ""final status"" treaty. Mr Barak also aims to reach peace with Syria by withdrawing from the Golan Heights-captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and held against fierce counterattack in the 1973 war-and thereby allow Israeli troops to pull out of south Lebanon, where Israel has been trying to hold a buffer since 1978. 
Mr Barak, a former army chief-of-- staff at the head of a revamped Labour-- led alliance, plays the role of the thinking man's thug-tough on security, but thoughtful about the causes of Israel's insecurity. He believes, for instance, that Israel is weakened by its continuing occupation of Arab land. 
However, he did oppose the 1995 Oslo agreement on interim autonomy for the Palestinians; he is no peacenik. The PLO wants all of the West Bank and the Gaza strip-only 22% of Mandate Palestine-for an independent Palestinian state with occupied Arab east Jerusalem as its capital. Mr Barak has signalled he intends to hand over about 60% of the West Bank-little more than a tenth of historic Palestine. He has declared that none of Arab Jerusalem will be handed back, and no Palestinian refugees-3.6m registered by the urr in the occupied territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and 4.5m worldwide-can return. 
Scepticism about an enduring settlement with the Palestinians-- the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict-is therefore amply justified. Doubly so, when the Syria-- Lebanon ""track"" of the peace process is likely to overtake the Palestinian ""track"". Negotiations with Damascus and its client in Beirut are essentially about security; Israel has no ideological claims on the Golan and south Lebanon, whereas religious Jews regard the West Bank as part of the Land of Israel given to them by God. Once the deal is done with the Syrian president, Hafez Assad, Yasser Arafat and his PLo will be isolated. Except in one explosive respect: the truly millennial issue of Jerusalem. 
Mr Barak wants this off the negotiating table, as though Arabs and Muslims could acquiesce in Israel's continuing occupation of the third holiest site in Islam, the Haram ash-Sharif in the Old City, with the Dome of the Rock and the ancient al-Aqsa mosque, a stone's throw from the Wailing Wall. Mr Arafat, great survivor though he is, could not give away Jerusalem-nor could any Arab or Muslim leader. 
Israel's initial plan was to make three Arab monarchs custodians of the holy sites, while retaining sovereignty: King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of Morocco, both of whom claimed descent from the Prophet Mohammed, and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, protector of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. King Hussein and King Hassan died in 1999, while King Fahd like many of his Arab peers is seriously ill. There was, in any event, no indication that the three would have co-operated. To have done so would have undermined their legitimacy. 
Legitimacy is, in any case, in short supply, highlighted by Arab leaders' seeming need to reassure themselves with 90-99% majorities in spurious plebiscites in countries that include Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen. Republican regimes in the region, paradoxically, appear to have worse dynastic problems than the absolute monarchies most of them replaced. The successions in Jordan, Morocco and Bahrain, and the incipient succession in Saudi Arabia, appear to be going fairly smoothly. By contrast, there are doubts about who will succeed the republican masters of Syria and Iraq. President Assad appears to be grooming his young and untried son, Bashar. Saddam Hussein has long given free rein to his murderous and racketeering sons, Uday and Qusay. Even if there were a peace settlement with Israel, these problems of legitimacy in the Arab world would remain. 
David Gardner: Middle East editor For the Financial Times.  1999 With the aged King Fahd so obviously ill and incapacitated, the transfer of power to the elderly, but less frail, Crown Prince Abdullah will be eagerly watched. He will take over a kingdom not yet in crisis but facing serious economic and social problems that oil earnings-greatly reduced from a decade ago-can no longer disguise. He will need to respond to the discontent of a generation of young people which has grown up amid oil wealth and for which the prospect of unemployment or low-paid work comes as a shock. The Kingdom's young will grow steadily more vocal. 
But those hoping for bold reforms will be disappointed. Fear of popular anger will ensure that the authorities delay the reforms needed to place the economy and state finances on a sustainable footing, and reduce the kingdom's overwhelming dependence on oil. The strength of oil prices in 2000 will provide some, albeit temporary, financial leeway, curbing the current-account deficit and boosting growth. Rather than liberalising the economy and wooing foreign investment, the government will concentrate on mobilising private Saudi capital to invest in new projects. 
Such caution will stem from the royal family's concern that cuts in state welfare could prompt disaffected Saudis to rally behind calls for a brand of Islamist nationalism that blames the country's ills on its political system. This potential will be accentuated by Saudi's increasing access to information on the Internet, and to the controversial talk shows broadcast by Qatar's uncensored Al-Jazeera satellite television channel. On this channel contentious issues, such as the foreign military presence and the state of the economy, get freely aired. The social liberalisation that is so apparent in the Gulf states will put serious pressure on the kingdom's moral rectitude. Yesterday's threat was Islamic extremism, tomorrow's will be a burgeoning young population that wants western-style reforms.  1999 For much of Latin America it will be a year of economic recovery. Growth for the region as a whole should reach 3-4%. This marks an improvement on 1999's sharp recession, which saw output fall by perhaps 1%, the worst performance in a decade. In South America, recovery will be steady rather than swift. Mexico escaped the recession because of its links with the United States' economy, but that in turn makes it vulnerable to any sharp slowdown north of the border. 
The region's economic performance will not be strong enough to sweep away the creeping political disillusion with market economics. But neither will the broad liberal reforms of the past decade be abandoned wholesale: some, such as privatisation, will continue, as will (Venezuela perhaps excepted) openness to foreign trade and investment. And as fiscal constraints ease somewhat, governments will pay more attention to social spending. 
The pace of recovery depends partly on outside factors, such as renewed growth in Europe and Asia offsetting a slowdown in the United States, and thus helping to boost prices for Latin America's commodity exports. Any sharp rise in American interest rates would hurt South America, too. But the key to recovery lies with Brazil (which accounts for two-fifths of Latin American cnr). President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces the challenge of holding his fractious coalition together despite his own deep unpopularity (prompted by the January 1999 devaluation) and the distraction of October's municipal elections. 
That means the government will make little progress with structural reform in taxes, pensions and public finances. But a strong rival to Mr Cardoso is unlikely to emerge. Instead, Brazil will muddle through (as it has done for much of the 500 years since the Portuguese arrived there, an anniversary it will commemorate in April). The government should manage to keep reasonably tight control over public spending. That, together with improvised revenue-raising measures, will allow it to meet, more or less, the fiscal targets agreed with the iMF, and its own target of 4% growth, helped by an increase, at last, in exports, as they respond to devaluation. 
Recovery in Brazil will help its neighbours in the Mercosur trade block. Presidential elections in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in the final months of 1999 were likely to usher in presidents of the centre-left in each country. Of the three, Argentina's Fernando de la Rua, a cautious radical, inherits the trickiest challenge. Argentina's rigid exchange-rate peg to the dollar was the cause of its rollercoaster economic progress during the 1990s under Carlos Menem. But if the arrangement is to survive (Brazil and Chile abandoned their less rigid currency pegs during 1999), Mr de la Rua will have to move quickly to lower business costs through fiscal, labour and anti-monopoly reforms. For these, he will need Mr Menem's support, since he will lack a congressional majority. Even if he fails, a weaker dollar might still let Argentina off its self-imposed hook. Otherwise it will face an unpalatable choice: adopting the dollar outright, or a devaluation that would be more traumatic than Brazil's. Each would constrain growth. 
The main threat to Latin American democracy will remain in the northern Andes. Colombia's civil wars will escalate. The army's new anti-drugs battalion, trained and financed by the United States, will enter combat against the leftwing guerrillas (but not the right-wing paramilitaries, even though both groups have links with the drug trade). America will pump money and, perhaps, military advisers, into helping President Andres Pastrana's government, but will not send in its own troops. The guerrillas may respond by using missiles against government aircraft. Peace talks will not be formally broken off, but will get nowhere. Slowly the guerrillas will start losing the war. 
In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez will win a referendum approving his new constitution, and go on to get himself reelected in a fresh presidential election, in the sixth national vote in 18 months. Higher oil prices mean the economy may temporarily recover, prolonging Mr Chavez's popularity. But his regime will be marked by populist gestures and creeping militarism. In Ecuador, general political chaos could see President Jamil Mahuad not only unable to nail down the iMF's support but overthrown by Congress, with a subsequent search for a strongman in the Chavez mould. Yet even so, constitutional appearances would probably be preserved. That is the fashion pioneered by another elected authoritarian, Peru's Alberto Fujimori, who since 1990 has successfully reformed his country's economy in a way Mr Chavez seems unlikely to do. Having brushed off legal objections to his candidacy, Mr Fujimori will try for a third term as president in April. Renewed economic growth, his government's influence over the media and the opposition's weakness ought to guarantee Mr Fujimori victory. But Peruvian voters, often unpredictable, may suddenly decide they have tired of him, and turn to Luis Castaneda Lossio, a canny centrist. 
In Cuba, Fidel Castro does not allow such uncertainties. His dictatorship will survive yet another year. The United States will relax its 40-year trade embargo against Cuba, allowing food and medicine sales into the country. But do not expect any liberalising gestures from Mr Castro in return. 
Michael Reid: Americas editor, The Economist.  1999 Chile's reborn democracy is limbering up for its tenth birthday in March 2000, battered and bruised from hefty blows in the previous two years. The extradition proceedings against General Augusto Pinochet, a former dictator, have reopened old political wounds. And the economy is still suffering from the effects of the emerging markets' crisis and the adverse weather that accompanied El Nino. In an attempt to revive output and employment, the government has allowed the fiscal accounts to slip into the red for the first time in 13 years. 
There is work to be done if Chile is to shake off its recent grogginess. The new government, which takes office in March, following an election in December, will have little time to enjoy the anniversary celebrations. Continued co-operation between the right and left will be crucial to maintain the consensus which has formed the cornerstone of Chile's economic success during the 1990s. Whatever the outcome of the Pinochet extradition saga, complete national reconciliation will be achieved only once the past is revisited without fear of recrimination. 
On the economic front, the first set of challenges for the new government appears straightforward. Given an improving external environment, relaxed monetary conditions and a low basis of comparison, GDr growth could reach 5% in 2000, while moderate import prices and spare capacity will restrain inflation. 
But to convince investors that it has truly returned to winning ways, Chile will need to overcome two stronger challenges: rebalancing the fiscal accounts; and restraining consumption to keep the currentaccount deficit at a sustainable level over the medium term. Success in both these areas would pave the way in 2000 for faster growth and development, and confirm Chile's (unofficial) status as Latin America's top-rank performer.  1999 Africa will amble through 2000 with an uneven gait. Its athletes will sweep up plenty of medals at the Olympic Games, again showing their world calibre. African footballers will score many goals in the Euro 2000 football championship. But many African economies will barely hobble past the starting line, compared with their competitors in Asia and Latin America. The brave hopes for an African economic revival have foundered as several regions' conflicts-in Ethiopia-Eritrea, Sudan, the giant Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola-have drawn in many of their neighbours. 
A tough triumvirate of African leaders will try to end the chaos. South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo and Algeria's Abdelaziz Bouteflika will cajole Africa's warring states into negotiations and peace deals. They will dominate Africa's continental club, the Organisation of African Unity (oAU). With their good political and diplomatic track-records, the three will be taken seriously in Africa and in the West. 
Their priority in 2000 is to consolidate a tentative peace in Congo. Closely related to this is the need to put new pressure on Jose dos Santos's government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITa rebels to end the latest round of Angola's 25year civil war. But progress here requires them to convince the uN Security Council to send international troops to Angola alongside local African peacekeepers. Angola and Congo will be the weariest of the world's warring states by 2000, and therein lies hope. 
Apart from diplomacy, Mr Bouteflika and Mr Obasanjo will be busy at home. Both are veterans of their countries' Byzantine politics; both returned to power in 1999, inheriting deeply fractured societies and weakened states. Algeria and Nigeria have enough gas and oil to finance much of their own economic recovery and to bring in foreign capital for the rest. They will be helped by the upswing in oil prices. Along with South Africa, they will be the key countries to watch for signs of any genuine African revival. 
Another prominent African, the urr secretary-general, Kofi Annan, will spend much of 2000 thinking about his troubled continent. The scheduled referendum on Western Sahara's independence in July will be a major test. Can the urr prevent a re-run of East Timor in North Africa? Certainly Morocco's new King Mohammed VI is no more eager to countenance losing the referendum than was Indonesia's General Wiranto in East Timor. The most likely outcome in Western Sahara is, therefore, continued Moroccan obstructionism. Perhaps the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, who talks to both Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front, will offer to mediate. Either way, expect to hear plenty about Western Sahara in 2000. It will be on every foreign editor's list. 
Egypt, Africa's fourth heavyweight, will grow at some 5% and its stockmarket even faster. A parliamentary election must be held in Egypt by November 2000. But do not expect much change as a result. To little surprise, President Hosni Mubarak was elected to a fourth six-year term by a familiar huge majority in September 1999. Exuding a pharaonic interest in the rest of Africa, President Mubarak will host a grand Europe-Africa summit in Cairo in April which promises to go beyond the usual pious hopes. Britain and France will make much of their new entente cordiale in Africa. 
Mr Mubarak is also keeping a close watch on Sudan and Somalia. Much as he distrusts the Islamist regime in Khartoum, which backed an attempt to kill him in 1995, Mr Mubarak does not want to see it forced to concede an independent Southern Sudan. That would challenge Cairo's control of the Nile. But the Khartoum regime will face a new wave of regional and international pressure to end its war with the south that has claimed more than 2m lives in 30 years. In Somalia, there will be almost no outside pressure, except from regional predators such as Egypt and Ethiopia. The rest of the world is still faintly embarrassed by the failure of the multi-billion-dollar efforts to intervene in the country. Somalia will show the world one thing in 2000: that it is quite possible to have a nation without any semblance of a government to run it. Across the continent, Charles Taylor's regime in Liberia is also a proponent of small government and big militias. Mr Taylor and his ally Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso will show that gangster politics is still pervasive in Africa. 
Democracy spreads 
A trio of more constitutionally minded governments along West Africa's coast-Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal-face elections in 2000. Incumbents Henri Konan-Bedie and Abdou Diouf are odds-on favourites to win in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal. Ghana's poll is harder to read. Jerry Rawlings, an ex-military leader and elected president, may confound the sceptics and step down after his statutory two terms. If he does such an unAfrican thing, he will set an example to the continent and his well-resourced National Democratic Congress Party should win. 
Successions will also dominate politics in Kenya and Zimbabwe where presidents Daniel arap Moi and Robert Mugabe must leave by 2002. Neither leader seems inclined to go. Neither has yet indicated successors. Both have aged badly. For the first time since independence in 1980, Mr Mugabe will face a serious opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, in parliamentary elections in mid2000. Most hopefully, both countries have a bright new generation of African entrepreneurs-working in information technology and telecommunicadons-who are launching companies on western stock exchanges. 
Both Tanzania and Namibia are on the up. They go to the polls in 2000 and will probably re-elect the incumbent parties of presidents Benjamin Mkapa and Sam Nujoma (even though Mr Nujoma had to change his country's liberal constitution to squeeze in a third term for himself). Promised elections in GuineaBissau are more problematic. The regime came to power after a coup. But elections in nearby Niger, which has a similar history, passed off in 1999 without trouble. 
Africa's coup-makers will find life tougher in 2000. Under Algerian President Bouteflika's chairmanship, the onu is to expel all regimes which come to power through force of arms, discreetly casting a veil over the political history of most of the continent's governments. 
Patrick Smith: editor, Africa Confidential.  1999 On July 2nd Mexico will hold a presidential election that will be the most hotly contested-and fairest-in its history. For the past 70 years, under the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power has changed hands through backroom deals; before that, it was often by the passage of arms. Now, the voters will be the arbiters. And they will probably choose to keep the PRi in power for another six years. 
Such an outcome is far from automatic. Thanks to the setting up of an independent electoral authority, and Mexico's slow but steady democratisation, the opposition has its bestever chance of winning. But the opposition is divided, between the socially conservative freemarketeers of the National Action Party (rAN) and the left-of-centre Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Efforts to unite them behind a single candidate will fail. 
Even without an opposition coalition, the PAN's Vicente Fox, a charismatic campaigner and former manager for Coca-Cola, could still mount a powerful challenge. Even so, provided the ruling party avoids splits, a narrow PRI victory is the likeliest outcome, not least because the party's influence over the media and its scope for making handouts to poorer voters still give it a residual advantage. 
But assuming it does win, which Par will it be? Certainly not the party of old, in which the outgoing president named his successor, whose victory was then assured. In November 1999, the PRi chose its candidate in its first-ever open primary election. 
The intense power battle within the rai could spark violence (as in 1994, when its presidential candidate and general-secretary were both murdered). The election will strain the stability of Mexico's still-evolving democracy and market economy. The defences look stronger than in 1994 (when for the fifth time in a row, presidential succession was accompanied by devaluation), but talk of Mexico gaining an investment-grade credit rating sounds premature until the next presidency is well settled. 
The economy will be hurt by any slowdown in the United States. It could still be badly shaken by political turmoil. But for all these caveats, Mexico in 2000 will start to look (not before time) like a modern, democratic country, driven by a powerful (and even fairly free) economy. In a country whose capacity for cruelty and chaos is greater than most, there is every reason to believe that 2000 will be a cathartic year of change. 
Students of Mexico quickly learn to enjoy paradox. There will be plenty about. A party that was often hated when it ruthlessly clung to power may now be popularly and freely returned to office. Mr Zedillo, who came to office as a colourless technocrat by the chance of a bullet, will have delivered far more radical reform than his macho predecessors. And a country that for many years relied on a folkloric hatred of America for its social cohesion will discover that it has surreptitiously learnt the gringo's tricks of capitalism and democracy, to its own considerable advantage. 
Whoever he may be, Mexico's next president will be weaker than his predecessors, forced to deal (as Mr Zedillo has been for the second half of his mandate) with a Congress in which no party has a majority. He will have to grapple, too, with intractable social inequalities. 
After a decade of warmth, Mexico's relations with the United States could become decidedly cooler, if economic problems north of the border were to spill over into trade disputes, adding to the rising tensions over the illegal drug trade. But NAFTa will survive. Indeed, it is steadily changing Mexico in ways that are already bordering on irreversible.  1999 As with human health, so with national conflict: prevention is better and cheaper than intervention, argues Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations. 
In the past 20 years we have understood the need for military intervention where governments grossly violate human rights and the international order. In the next 20 years we must learn how to prevent conflicts as well as how to intervene in them. Even the costliest policy of prevention is far cheaper, in lives and in resources, than the least expensive intervention. 
This is why we have been pressing the international community to take prevention more seriously. In cost-benefit terms the case for doing this is compelling. A recent study by the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict estimated that the cost to the international community of the seven major wars in the 1990s, not including Kosovo and East Timor, was $199 billion. Add in these two conflicts and $230 billion seems a likely figure. 
Effective prevention could have saved most of this huge sum. More important, it could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. 
Time and again, differences are allowed to develop into disputes and disputes allowed to develop into deadly conflicts. Time and again, warning signs are ignored and pleas for help overlooked. Only after the deaths and the destruction do we intervene at a far higher human and material cost, by which time there are fewer lives left to save. Only when it is too late, it seems, do we value prevention. 
There are, in my view, three main reasons for the failure of prevention when prevention so clearly is possible. First, the reluctance of one or more of the parties to a conflict to accept external intervention of any kind. Second, the lack of political will at the highest levels of the international community. Third, a lack of integrated conflict-prevention strategies within the uN system and the international community. Of all these, the will to act is the most important. Without the political will to act when action is needed, no amount of improved coordination or early warning will translate awareness into action. 
The founders of the uN drew up its charter with a sober view of human nature. They had witnessed the ability of humanity to wage a war of unparalleled brutality and unprecedented cruelty. They had witnessed, above all, the failure of prevention, when prevention was, throughout the 1930s, still possible and every signal pointed to war. 
Of course, as realists we must also recognise that in some cases the sheer intractability of conflicts and the obduracy of the warring parties will make intervention unlikely to succeed. But even wars that cannot be stopped once started might well have been avoided with effective preventive policies. 
We are under no illusion that preventive strategies will be easy to implement. For a start, the costs of prevention have to be paid in the present, while its benefits lie in the distant future. And the benefits are not tangible-when prevention succeeds, nothing happens. Taking such a political risk when there are few obvious rewards requires conviction and considerable vision. 
Second, there are real institutional barriers to the institutional co-operation that prevention requires. In national governments and international agencies, departments responsible for security tend to know little about development or governance; those responsible for the latter rarely think of them in security terms. Identifying such constraints is not a counsel of despair. It is a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for progress. 
The UN has long argued that good governance, democratisation, respect for human rights and policies for equitable and sustainable development are the best form of long-term conflict prevention. The changing patterns of global conflict and governance in recent years, particularly with respect to democratisation, provide ample evidence to support our conviction. 
More votes, less war 
During the 1990s there has been a remarkable and little-noticed reduction in global warfare. More old wars have ended than new ones begun. Between 1989 and 1992 on average eight new ethnic wars began each year; today the average is two a year. Between 1992 and 1998 the scope and intensity of armed conflict around the world declined by about a third. The number of democratically elected governments increased by about the same proportion. 
We cannot leap to the conclusion that the increase in the number of democracies has caused the decrease in warfare. Other factors, such as the end of the cold war, surely also played a role (although the two are obviously related). 
But the evidence is in line with the well-established, if little publicised, finding that democracies have far lower levels of internal violence than nondemocracies. This is not really surprising. The non-violent management of conflict is the very essence of democracy. In an era when more than 90% of wars take place within, not between, states, the import of this finding far conflict prevention should be obvious. 
Prevention is no panacea. It requires that governments act in good faith and place the welfare of citizens above narrow sectional interests. But we know that some conflict-prone governments see prevention policies, particularly those which stress democratisation and good governance, as a threat to their own power and privilege. For that reason, they are likely to reject them. 
The fact that prevention will not work everywhere is an argument against naive optimism, but not against actively supporting democratisation, good governance and other preventive policies. These are not only important goods in their own right. They are also among the most potent and costeffective antidotes to the scourge of war.  1999 Water shortages will grow ever more serious; the stuff of future wars. Levels in aquifers, the underground layers of porous rock which hold most of the world's supply of fresh water, are dropping. By 2025, there will not be enough water to supply the basic needs of 18 nations, including Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Jordan and the Palestine area. Look out for tension between Turkey, Syria and Iraq over the Euphrates and between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the Nile. With 3.5 billion people affected by water shortages by 2050, conditions are ripe for a century of water conflicts. Curiously, these may well begin in the rich world. Canada is getting upset about losing its water to America. And within America quarrels between the states will grow more acute.  1999 Five main issues will dominate European Union business in 2000. The first will be trade. A new millennium round of world trade talks, launched in Seattle in November 1999, will mean a fierce and deserved assault on the Eu's protectionist farm policies. America, Australia and New Zealand will lead the attack. 
The Eu has no good arguments left to justify its farm subsidies, which cost taxpayers about $50 billion each year (half the Eu budget). They survive mainly because governments fear to offend riotprone Mediterranean farmers. All eyes will be on the defensive tactics devised by the Eu's newly appointed trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, a Frenchman. France is the most instinctively protectionist country in the Eu. It is the staunchest defender (and, not coincidentally, the largest recipient) of farm subsidies. But Mr Lamy may yet surprise. Some say the new president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, gave him the trade job because it will take a Frenchman to persuade France to accept a farm deal that includes the necessary cuts in subsidies. 
Second on the agenda is the need for administrative reform. The owlish Mr Prodi has promised to purge the European Commission of sleaze and waste, following the shamefaced resignation in March 1999 of the previous commission led by Jacques Santer. Reform is also necessary to cope with new members, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe. The Eu institutions-mainly, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers-were designed for six member states. A few tweaks have helped them accommodate a current membership of 15. But with the prospect of at least a dozen more countries joining the Union in the coming ten years, changes of substance will be needed. 
This will mean a new au treaty. To prepare it, governments will send ministers or ambassadors to a constitutional conference that will begin in the first half of the year, when Portugal holds the Eu presidency, and which will end in the second half of the year, when France is in charge. The talks must agree to cap the number of European commissioners at the present 20 (or less), however many more countries join the Union. The commission is the Eu's civil service. The commissioners who head it also have a strong policymaking role. At present, big countries send two commissioners each to Brussels and small countries send one. The big countries are resigned to losing their second commissioners as part of the effort to cut numbers. The question is how to persuade the small countries to accept a new system in which at least some of them may have no commissioners at all. 
A way must also be found to allocate voting power more fairly in the Council of Ministers. This body (and not the European Parliament, despite its name) is the Eu's legislature. Big countries have more votes in the council than small ones: the minister representing France has ten votes, his counterpart from Luxembourg has two. But additions to the council down the years have been dealt with ad hoc, and inequalities have accumulated. Governments need to agree on general rules for voting power when any new country joins. 
A new treaty must also widen qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers. The more countries join the Eu, the more national vetoes may be wielded. That argues for taking more big decisions by qualified majority voting. (Qualified means that more than a simple majority is needed to pass a law. The present formula demands 62 votes out of a possible 85.) But opinions differ sharply as to the areas where more majority voting should be used. 
The Eu must keep sight of its third big bit of business in 2000: the enlargement process itself. Of the 12 countries recognised as possible new members (13 if Turkey is added), the six most promising will complete a first phase of negotiations with the European Commission by the summer. Each will have measured its national legislation minutely against all Eu legislation, and will have drawn up a plan for dealing with shortfalls. But each will have a few last points on which it wants special treatment-a waiver to run a heavily polluting power station, or permission to bar foreigners from buying farmland. These differences are meant to be settled in the second half of the year. 
The closer the first candidates edge towards readiness (Estonia, Poland and Hungary will probably be the leaders), the greater the pressure on Eu governments to give firm dates for entry. Even the most polite countries in the queue are losing their patience. They say that the longer entry dates are withheld, the harder it becomes for them to keep up the momentum of reforms needed to deliver on their side of the bargain. 
The fourth big Eu project for 2000 will be a charter of fundamental rights for all Eu citizens. This will be drafted by a diverse committee of worthies and reviewed by national leaders at a summit in December 2000. It is hard to say in advance how much impact this document will have. It may be just flimflam. It may have all sorts of practical consequences if the rights it enshrines are enforceable directly in law. In Brussels jargon, the charter of rights is meant to bring the Eu closer to the citizen. And too bad for the citizen who craves only the right to keep his distance. 
The final theme for 2000 will be that of European defence, a theme so important that it is dealt with separately in the article that follows. 
Robert Cottrell: EU correspondent for The Economist.  1999 In the coming year, the European Union will move decisively on to new terrain: it will adopt a common and assertive defence policy. In December 2000, at the Eu's Paris summit, heads of government will endorse a plan to give the Eu a military organisation. The Western European Union, a defence club of ten states that is currently semi-detached from the Eu, will be merged with it. The Eu will then be able to undertake small-scale military missions in its own name. 
The rationale of these plans is that Eu diplomacy would carry more weight if underpinned by the ability to deploy force. The initiative is not only about new European institutions, but also more capable armed forces. The Kosovo war reminded Eu governments that they cannot do a great deal without American support. They lack sophisticated command, control and communication systems; enough ships and aircraft for transporting men and equipment; precision-guided weaponry; and the airborne surveillance systems which can monitor events on the ground. 
Thus in the autumn of 1999, when the British government proposed that the Eu should adopt ""defence performance goals"" as a means of improving military capabilities, most other Eu governments welcomed the idea. The point of these performance goals would not be to get Eu states to increase defence budgets, since that is not politically feasible. It would rather be to encourage governments to spend their defence budgets more wisely. 
At present, for example, the combined defence budgets of the Eu governments amount to about half of the $290 billion that the United States spends on defence. But their ability to project force, away from home, is perhaps 10% that of the United States. Too many European governments spend their budgets on large conscript armies, rather than modern equipment and training. Governments need to keep their soldiers at a higher state of readiness; to provide them with the means to be mobile; and to be able to sustain them at a distance. 
Thus Eu defence ministers will agree to set goals (both for the Eu as a whole and for individual countries) on, for example, the numbers of soldiers they could deploy outside the NaTO area, and the length of time for which the force could be sustained. The Eu will not attempt to enforce these targets through centrally set rules. But there will be a process of peer review and exchange of best practice, perhaps supervised by the Eu's new high representative for foreign and defence policy, Javier Solana. 
Britain and France (which is introducing a professional army) already perform quite well; many other Eu countries do not. The Germans have a particular problem, with a large, ill-equipped conscript army that is geared to territorial defence. The leading role of Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, in this defence initiative is crucial, for the British will have to convince the Americans that European defence is good for the Atlantic alliance. The British must point out to the Americans that the initiative is not designed to weaken NATO. For the Eu is unlikely to act on its own, unless the Americans do not wish to take part in a military enterprise. For example, if the Europeans wished to rescue Eu nationals from a civil war in North Africa, or to deploy peacekeepers in part of the Balkans, Americans might easily decline to take part. The Eu would then take political responsibility for such a mission, while using some of NATO's assets and command structures. 
The French like to talk about the Eu acting ""autonomously"" (a word that annoys the Americans), but even they do not want the Eu to build military organisations that duplicate what NATO does; they know the Europeans do not have the money. Many American policymakers admit to being in two minds about European defence. On the one hand, they would welcome a Europe that could do more militarily, and thus be of more help to the United States when it tries to sort out world crises. On the other, they worry that a more effective European foreign and security policy would sometimes oppose American interests. 
In practice the United States has little choice but to support this European defence initiative, while asking that its particular concerns be addressed (for example, that Turkey, in NaTO but not the Eu, should not be excluded from the new European defence arrangements). For if it opposed European defence in general, or vetoed the use of NATO assets to support the Eu on a particular occasion, this would prompt the Europeans to build military structures that were independent of NaTO, rather than closely linked to it. The United States will almost certainly bless the new European defence arrangements, when they are unveiled in Paris in December 2000. 
The role of individual politicians in making a success of this initiative will be crucial. George Robertson, NATO's secretary-general, Mr Solana, the Eu's high representative, and Chris Patten, the European commissioner for foreign policy, are all pro-European and committed Atlanticists. They will have to make the ""Common Foreign and Security Policy"" effective. And they must convince European governments, as well as Washington, that a strong European security policy is compatible with a solid Atlantic alliance and could even strengthen it. 
Charles Grant: director of the Centre for European Reform.  1999 France will enter a new century as convinced as ever of ""the French exception"", that blend of history and revolutionary culture which the French believe makes them unique-or, as foreigners sometimes reckon, simply awkward. The result will be a year of frequent irritation between France and its allies: there will be rows with America over the ""millennium round"" agenda of the World Trade Organisation; and with the European Commission and fellow members of the European Union over state aids, market access, institutional reform and the pace of the Eu's expansion eastwards. 
Indeed, when France assumes the Eu's rotating presidency in the second half of the year, its central role may increase rather than lessen the frictions. Yet it would be wrong to exaggerate France's awkwardness. On defence, for example, France is well aware, especially after the wars in the Gulf and in Kosovo, of its deficiencies, and so will lead the drive for a co-ordinated European capability. In this, it will build on the agreement reached with Britain at St Malo in December 1998. 
Moreover, many of the irritants in France's outward behaviour will stem from the histrionic nature of its domestic politics, in particular the campaign for the presidential election due in May 2002. President Jacques Chirac, a conservative, is determined to win a second seven-year term; the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, is determined to thwart Mr Chirac by winning the election for himself and his left-wing coalition. 
This ""cohabitation"" of a president and prime minister in opposition to each other is something French voters have seemingly grown fond of. A charitable explanation is that it forces politics to seek a middle ground; a cynical explanation is that it forestalls much needed reforms-of the tax system, for example, or education or trade union powersthat voters might individually find uncomfortable. 
Whatever the explanation, one of the big tests for Mr Jospin in the coming few months will be the implementation, from January 1st 2000, of a programme that helped win the left's surprise victory in 1997: the 35-hour week for firms employing 20 or more people (smaller firms will have to implement it from 2002). Rather than taking on new workers-the purpose of the programme-employers have tended to react by investing in productivity-raising technology. The consequence is that unemployment has stubbornly remained at over a tenth of the workforce. 
Mr Jospin claims this will change as robust economic growth (forecast at perhaps 3% in 2000) continues. If he is wrong, however there is likely to be a severe backlash from disappointed workers-and damage to several political reputations, especially that of the left-wing labour minister, Martine Aubry. By contrast, the influence of France's employers would increase. In any event, more follies of this kind are unlikely from the Jospin government. 
The debate, however, somewhat misses the point. France remains one of the most state-dominated nations in the Eu, with a costly welfare state (obligatory social charges are around 45% of GDP, compared with about 35% in America), a large public sector and a generous provision of public services. It is this structure, with its rhetoric of ""solidarity"" between social classes, that helps identify the ""French exception"". 
Yet the truth is that France is becoming less exceptional. The nationalisations of the early Mitterrand years have been transformed into a sustained programme of privatisation from which few state firms-not even France Telecom-have been exempted. Indeed Renault, once an emblem of the state sector, has become a private-sector leader confident enough not just to take control of Japan's Nissan but to cut a swathe through its workforce. Meanwhile, hostile takeover bids are no longer inconceivable. French companies, such as Vivendi, seize markets overseas; and stock-options are the required reward of a new generation of senior managers. 
In other words, for all the strikes-by the left, by the students, by the farmers, and by other interest groups-that are a commonplace of French politics, and for all the populist rhetoric against business, France, it seems, is stealthily adopting some Anglo-Saxon habits.  1999 The Germans are in a paradoxical mood. They say they want reforms, but then rebel against the measures needed to achieve them. Most of them understand that public spending is too high. They have been told over and over again that the public debt has tripled since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and is now above the limit imposed by membership of the European currency union. But presented with a tax-and-spending reform package designed to take DM30 billion ($16.5 billion) off the budget for 2000, they have demonstrated their distaste at the ballot box. In a string of regional and local elections in the autumn of 1999, they have given a mighty drubbing to the ruling Social Democrats and their coalition partners, the Greens. Worse could be to come if the voters in North Rhine-Westphalia abandon their long-standing support for the Social Democrats in key regional elections in May 2000. With nearly 18m people, this state has nearly a quarter of Germany's population. Cassandras are already muttering that if North Rhine-Westphalia goes, then so must the chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. 
It all looked very different in September 1998 when Mr Schroder won a famous victory over the Christian Democrat Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a veteran heavyweight who had lasted 16 years in office. True, in order to get a working majority Mr Schroder had to enter a coalition with the small Green Party, a combination that had never before been tried at federal level, and was clearly going to involve some compromises. Fortunately, the Greens' star turn, Joschka Fischer, who demanded and got the foreign ministry, turned out to be both more reasonable and more capable than many of his new colleagues had feared. He also proved a hit with the public: he is now well ahead of the chancellor himself in opinion polls. Unfortunately his party's popularity with the public is on the wane, casting doubt on the coalition's long-term viability. 
The main problem for Mr Schroder so far, however, has come not from the Greens but from the ranks of his own party. In March 1999, only six months into the new government's term of office, Oskar Lafontaine, the finance minister and Social Democratic Party chairman, resigned from his post after a series of stormy disagreements with the chancellor. But out of office has not meant out of sight or mind: Mr Lafontaine has styled himself as the defender of his party's traditional left-wing values, and continues to snipe at the chancellor from the sidelines. His successor as finance minister, Hans Eichel, is a less mercurial character, and much closer to Mr Schroder. He is widely thought to have made a good start in his job, but his detractors maintain he has the charisma of a paper clip. 
Mr Schroder came to office on the promise of delivering a ""new centre"", a somewhat vague concept apparently similar to the ""third way"" successfully pursued by Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. The two leaders seem to enjoy slapping each other's backs in public, but many of their similarities are only skin-deep. Mr Blair took over as leader of the Labour Party well ahead of the election that brought him to power in May 1997, which gave him time to shape it in his image. Mr Schroder, by contrast, was chosen as the Social Democrats' candidate for the chancellorship only a few months before the 1998 election, so his party remained unreformed and his relationship with the trade unions unresolved. Large chunks of his party are uncomfortable with his attempts to get closer to business, and disapprove of his reform plans. 
For good measure, Mr Schroder is also having more trouble with the Christian Democratic opposition than his majority in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, seemed to indicate. The regional-election defeats the Social Democrats suffered during 1999 have lost them the majority they held in the upper house, the Bundesrat, which matters because Bundesrat approval is required for all major financial legislation, including the proposed budget-reform package. 
So will the Christian Democrats play hard to get? They must be tempted. After all, in their last few years in power they themselves were trying to introduce similar reforms, and were thwarted by the Social Democrat opposition which at that time had a majority in the Bundesrat. In blocking these reforms, the Social Democrats introduced a new word into the German vocabulary: Reformstau (reform logjam). The Christian Democrats, having publicly acknowledged the need for reforms, may not want to cast themselves in such an obstructionist role, so the chances are that they will allow through at least some of the budget reforms (but extract concessions in return). 
If he can get his budget through, Mr Schroder's fortunes may yet improve. The German economy, after growing by less than 1.5% in 1999, looks set for 2.5% or more in 2000, thanks partly to strong exports. Despite Germany's image as an economic tortoise-slow to abandon excessive regulation and introduce market reform-a great deal of restructuring has been going on behind the scenes that is beginning to make industry leaner and fitter. Investment looks set to pick up. Inflation has almost disappeared from the radar screen, but private consumption will remain hesitant, because unemployment-which today's Germans care more deeply about than any other economic issue-is likely to remain above 10%. And that figure is an average for Germany as a whole. In former East Germany, which remains stubbornly poorer and less productive than former West Germany, unemployment is double that in the west, at over 17%. 
There is more cheer to be had from contemplating Germany's place in the wider world. During NaTO's intervention in Kosovo in the spring of 1999, Mr Schroder reassured his partners by his clear commitment to the cause and by his ability to keep his pacifist-minded Green coalition partner on board. Looking ahead, Germany is expected to play a prominent part in the negotiations for enlarging the European Union to the east that are now getting under way. More broadly, the Germans> after decades of trying to live down their recent history, are becoming more self-confident: twothirds of them think that the past is becoming less important and that their country, with 82m people and much the biggest economy of any Eu member, should play a leading European role. With the government's move from Bonn to Berlin now more or less complete, 2000 will be the first year in half a century when a German government has operated from a ""permanent"" rather than a ""provisional"" capital. 
If there were to be an election next Sunday, the Social Democrats would probably see their share of the vote plummet well below that of the Christian Democrats, and their coalition partners, the Greens, might be consigned to electoral oblivion. But the next federal election is not due until the autumn of 2002. Mr Schroder clearly cannot afford to be complacent but nor, as yet, should he allow himself to become unduly depressed. When his predecessor, Mr Kohl, first became chancellor, he slipped on so many banana skins that critics doubted he could last his full term. He went on to become Germany's longest-serving chancellor since Bismarck. 
Barbara Beck: surveys editor, The Economist.  1999 The biggest single happening in 2000 will be the World Exposition that opens in Hanover Germany, on June 1st. Some 40m people will visit it before it shuts at the end of October, over 250,000 a day. The World Exposition movement-now shortened to Expo-was started in London in 1851. Then it was held in the Crystal Palace which was erected by Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's German husband, in Hyde Park. When it came to Paris, the Eiffel Tower was built. In Hanover there will be nothing so spectacular, except the statistics: Expo 2000 will generate $1.7 billion; 191 countries will display their wares, mostly in their own pavilions. This will be the first major international event held in Germany since unification. You can be sure that will be worth the visit: a better bet than London's Dome.  1999 Many people have come to see the Netherlands as a model country. It is the most successful of the core Eu countries. Its economy, which combines market liberalisation with social fairness, remained buoyant when several of its Eu partners struggled in the face of the world's economic troubles. But for how much longer can this social and economic ""bed of roses"", to use a popular Dutch expression, stay in full bloom? 
Paradoxically, flourishing economic conditions seem to present the greatest danger. The Netherlands owes much of its success to its tradition of effective negotiation and consensus between the government, the employer federations and the trade unions. This has produced some excellent policies in recent years, such as restraints on public spending, reforms of the labour market and the social-security system, and wage moderation. But these measures were taken in less rosy economic times. Now the 15-year-old consensus is eroding. 
In boom times corporate profits have risen strongly and trade unions are increasingly unwilling to accept wage restraint for the sake of the international competitiveness of Dutch firms, when executives are rewarding themselves with huge pay rises. Unbridled consumer spending and spiralling house prices have cast further doubts on the sustainability of the Dutch model. 
A period of economic belttightening may be just what is needed. Employment growth, which has been a source of envy for the country's Eu partners, will come to a halt in 2000, weakening consumer confidence and dampening the economy. Meanwhile, spirits could be raised if, as many expect, the Dutch national team wins the European soccer championship, which it is co-hosting with Belgium. The Orange feel-good factor tends to work wonders for Dutch morale and community spirit.  1999 Although they live in a divided country, Belgians have a talent for showing solidarity in times of crisis. When faced with an emergency (not a rare occurrence: a string of scandals has entangled the country in recent years) feuds between the Dutchspeaking Flemish and French-speaking Walloon communities are put on hold and people unite. When an outrage involving an outbreak of food contamination through the mixing of dioxin with animal feed erupted in May 1999, Belgians of all kinds responded by being uncharacteristically decisive. They showed their discontent through the ballot box by throwing out the government and putting an end to 40 years of political domination by the Christian Democrats. 
The question now will be: can the new government, an untried combination of Liberals, Socialists and Greens, pull the country out of its doldrums? It is helped by the fact that the previous government did bring public finances under control. After the setback from the food scare, Belgium is back on track to benefit from a general au-wide and global economic recovery. cnr growth will accelerate to a respectable 2.6%. Inflation will pick up slightly but remain safely below the price stability target set by the European Central Bank. 
But the danger is that, once the initial enthusiasm for change has faded along with the latest scandal, the country's underlying divisions will resurface. The new coalition could split not only as a result of the reemergence of linguistic divisions but also over important policy issues such as privatisation, working time, taxation or social benefits. Above all it will want to avoid another major setback and to improve the international image of Belgium in a year when Brussels will be a European city of culture and Ghent will celebrate the 500th anniversary of Charles V's birth.  1999 Several million pilgrims will pour into Rome during the course of 2000 for the Jubilee of the Catholic Church. Catholic parishes around the world are independently preparing their own groups of pilgrims to St Peter's, making the numbers that will come difficult to predict. No other city, except perhaps London, is taking the millennium so seriously, with many museums being renovated and events planned by no means only at the Vatican. Rome's ability to cope with the crowds will be tested well beyond its limit. So, if you have no religious motives to visit Italy's capital, wait for 2001. 
Waiting may prove difficult, though, for Massimo D'Alema, whose centre-left government does not have to face a general election until 2001. His parliamentary majority is a rowdy bunch which includes Catholic militants and greens, free-marketeers and hard-line communists, former socialists and disgruntled faithfuls of Romano Prodi, the current president of the European Commission, who consider Mr D'Alema responsible for Mr Prodi's abrupt dismissal from Palazzo Chigi (the prime minister's residence) in 1998. This is not new, of course, in a country that has had 56 governments since the second world war. 
Yet Italians are growing impatient with short-lived administrations; they want stability. If the current centre-left majority dissolves because of internal squabbles-and it might-the centreright, led by tycoon-cum-politician Silvio Berlusconi, will easily win the next election, despite its leader's legal tangles (three convictions, appeals pending, more trials coming up). 
Youth unemployment and crime will be the most heated political topics. A short-sighted immigration policy and an uncomfortable geographical position-- the Balkans are just a few miles across the Adriatic-have allowed many illegal immigrants to sneak into the country. Unlike the law-abiding million-odd immigrants, many of these clandestine have set up criminal rings that compete or cooperate with the local mob. 
The economy will grow rather slowly but will become more competitive and transparent. Within the European Monetary Union, export-oriented Italy does not have the advantage of a weak currency; and Mario Monti, the commissioner for competition in Brussels, watches severely over his own country. Some will moan as more of Italy's top brands are snapped up by foreign companies. As outgoing investments are five times higher than incoming ones, nobody should care. The complaints of foreign investors will help to cut down the forest of red tape, still the primary problem for Italy's economy. A guess: Fiat, Italy's largest private group, will find the global partner it is looking for. 
Reform in Italy cannot be delayed, despite years of successful resistance. The list of things needing attention is almost universally agreed: 
Justice. The average time between indictment and a court judgment is ten years; eight out of ten convictions that involve prison terms never take effect. 
Defence. The armed forces are outdated, apart from a few elite corps. 
Transport. There are too many strikes in the public-transport system; the motorway system has become obsolete. 
The health service. Hospitals in big cities are run down; there are too many doctors everywhere. 
Welfare. Pensions eat up too much of Italy's public finances and will bankrupt the government unless there are further reductions. 
Each of these will provide plenty of scandals and general unhappiness in 2000. But ferocious lobbying will prevent much from happening. A small piece of legislation, a magistrate, a political party, a street rally: weapons are not hard to find in Italy if you want to stop something from happening. 
The improvements needed in Italy's civic society are also universally acknowledged; and they will also be slow in coming. Too many Italians will avoid paying taxes in 2000. According to one estimate, 30% of all incomes are hidden from the taxman, and up to 50% in the south of the country. Too few will wear seat belts. On average, according to Automobil Club Italiano, only 20% do, compared with 80% in the rest of the Eu. Stopping at zebra crossings will still be considered bizarre behaviour. 
Nonetheless, a generation of professional people, which travelled and studied abroad in the 1980s, is coming of age, and will leave its mark. English will be more widely spoken. And although several north European countries fear creeping ""Italianisation"", Italy will pick up some northern habits. Some good (a less emotional attitude; more attention to the environment; a desire for more stable government). Some less so (more television-watching, more heavy drinking and violence among young people). 
An easy prediction: il calcio (football) will dominate 2000. The amount of money spent by the teams, the television time and newspaper space devoted to the sport will be staggering-even those Vatican pilgrims will notice that Italy has at least another, more mundane, faith. 
Beppe Severgnini: columnist for Corriere della Sera and Italy correspondent for The Economist. His latest book is ""Italiani si diventa"" (Rizzoli).  1999 Adjourn nowadays to one of the Dublin pubs immortalised by James Joyce for some of that famous chat and Guinness, and there is a fair chance that your barperson will be from Brisbane or Barcelona, unskilled in the great art of pulling a good pint of the black stuff. Ireland's prolonged boom is bringing the world to its doorstep. 
The republic is about to enter the sixth year of a cycle in which Irish economic growth rates have outstripped all Eu and oECD states. In 1999 the economy grew by 6-7%, compared with a eurozone average of 2% and an oECD average of about 2.4%. In 2000, Irish growth will probably be around 6%, with unemployment between 4% and 5%, and a surplus of perhaps IRL2 billion ($1.4 billion) for the exchequer. 
The visitor will hear of Monte Carlo-scale prices for houses in the south Dublin suburbs and sonorous tales of delivery delays for new luxury cars. Friday's Irish Times will come weighted with pages of,job offers for computer engineers, investment analysts and financial-services specialists. And, invariably, the visitor will hear the question posed, ""How long will it last?"" 
The answer in terms of living standards is probably indefinitely, although future growth is not going to be maintained at near double-digit figures and the staggering rise in house prices will tail off. The industries that sustain the Irish economic wonder-computers, electronics, pharmaceuticals and financial services-are well-embedded. Membership of the euro will ensure tight fiscal controls, low interest rates and modest inflation. The biggest threat may be the shortage of skilled employees. Ireland's wealth per head may have edged ahead of the United Kingdom but it still lags behind that of France, Germany, the Benelux and the Scandinavian countries. There should be nothing too remarkable about a small state of 3.5m people, by and large well-educated, achieving mainstream European levels of earnings more than a quarter-century after joining the EEC. But there are more searching questions to be asked. 
Dublin is not Ireland. And the elegant villas of Killiney and Howth are not Dublin. Serious problems of regional imbalance remain, with the midlands and the Atlantic seaboard counties trailing well behind the capital and the eastern towns. There are evident problems. The rail system is poor and unreliable. Modern motorways peter off into two-lane country roads. Dublin's daily traffic tangles are the stuff of urban legend. Under pressure from increasingly impatient business and industry sectors, the Fianna Fail-led government of Bertie Ahern will start a IR33 billion programme of infrastructural investment in 2000 to stretch over seven years. 
The republic's middle classes are doing better but the poor, according to the latest OECD figures, are faring proportionately less well. Almost half a million investors made paper profits-at least in the short term-out of the privatisation of the national telecom company in 1999 and something similar is likely to happen, probably towards the end of 2000, with the flotation of Aer Lingus, the state airline. Notwithstanding the emergence of this new shareowning class and the huge increase in jobs, a core of almost 100,000 long-term unemployed will remain in 2000. In certain bleak suburban wastelands the recurring cycle of poor education, crime, drugs and poverty has yet to be broken. 
The priority for the government in 2000 will be to renew the successful national pay partnerships which have set the framework for economic growth. The unions will probably agree if the government can find ways in which to reduce, rather than exacerbate, social and economic inequity and to even out the growing imbalances in regional development. Efforts to date have not been notably successful. Runaway house prices and speculative investment will see many young couples-even those with good jobs-still unable to buy a home in Dublin. 
Mr Ahern's government depends on the support of the Progressive Democrats and a number of independents in the Dail. Two judicial tribunals, sitting at Dublin Castle to investigate (among other things) the allegations of corruption against a former prime minister, Charles Haughey, will be reporting within the next year. So too will be a special committee of the Dail, investigating the role of the banks and the revenue authorities in tax-evasion. The political and business establishments, many of whose leading lights have been in and out of the witness box, await the tribunals' reports with trepidation. So far, Mr Ahern has remained largely untouched by the tide of sleaze but if this were to change it is certain that his coalition partners would insist on a switch of leadership. In that event, watch for the rise of Charles McCreevey, the finance minister, or the clean-cut, not-yet-40, education minister, Micheal Martin. 
There is also something new in the Irish air. The country's once-undiluted enthusiasm for Europe is on the wane. Ireland will shortly become a net contributor to the Eu coffers, bringing the gravy train, which has undoubtedly contributed greatly to the recent years of prosperity, to a halt. Simultaneously, the government's decision to make a military commitment to NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative will provide a focus to the debate over the increase in these international links, and their threat to Ireland's longstanding and sacrosanct tradition of neutrality. 
The slow, painstaking search for a settlement in Northern Ireland will continue. Few expect a breakdown in the form of a return to full-scale violence. The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, has discovered that not all power grows from the barrel of a gun-and will be busy during the year, seeking to build its future electoral base, north and south. A working settlement in Northern Ireland would greatly enhance Mr Ahern's political prestige. As ever, in 2000, the Irish both north and south will recognise that they are obliged to share life on a very small island. With peace confirmed in one part and prosperity in the other, 2000 will be a year of promise. 
Conor Brady: editor, Irish Times.  1999 Outside observers tend to imagine that the Nordic countries share common ""Nordic values"" and have the same attitudes towards most issues. But neighbourliness does not mean uniformity. Take the crucial issue of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which reveals striking differences between the countries. 
Sweden and Denmark, which have so far opted out of the single currency, will grapple with the issue of joining. Goran Persson, the pro-EMU Swedish prime minister, faces powerful opposition to participation from within and outside his party, making a Swedish move towards membership unlikely. Mr Persson will hope that a party congress in early 2000 will at least lead his party to back his policy wholeheartedly. So much euroscepticism in Sweden makes Denmark, which nearly derailed the Maastricht treaty with its infamous ""no"" vote in 1992, look positively pro-European. Its prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, can expect a majority in favour of EMU membership in a referendum, which could be held in late 2000. 
Finland, by far the most proEuropean Nordic country, was a founder-member of EMU. Finns can therefore worry about other issues, such as electing a new president in early 2000. Elisabeth Rehn looks set to become the first female Finnish president. By contrast, Norway is not even an Eu member (and with oil revenue recovering nicely in 2000 after the 1998 price collapse, Norwegians will be in no hurry to change their minds on Eu membership). That rules out the EMU possibility altogether. 
Whatever the stance on EMU, and despite varying growth prospects (1.8% in Denmark, 4.5% in Iceland), there will be one common Nordic theme in 2000: budgetary virtue. Iceland's budget will be close to balance. And the other four will be able to report a surplus on the general government balance.  1999 An uncanny silence, punctuated by the occasional roar, will fall over Europe for two hours in the early evening of Sunday July 2nd. The continent's lOOm football fans will be glued to their television sets watching the final of the European Championship being fought out in Rotterdam. 
This championship, second only to football's once-every-four-years World Cup, is being hosted by two nations: the Netherlands and Belgium. Ironically, these neighbouring countries have a particular enmity towards each other on the football field; recent matches between them have seen players on both sides sent off, as well as an onpitch brawl. 
For stylish play look to Italy, which boasts the world's costliest player, the 90 billion lire ($50m) Christian Vieri. France, which in a typically centralised French way has a well-financed and well-subsidised development programme for young players, will do well. Not well enough though to beat the Dutch, whose big-name players such as Edgar Davids (Juventus), Japp Stam (Manchester United) and Patrick Kluivert (Barcelona) play in foreign leagues. They have the look of favourites.  1999 The year 2000 will mark the 25th anniversary of the death of General Franco, the autocrat who governed the country for nearly four decades, after scoring a cruel and bloody victory in the Spanish civil war (1936-39). A quarter of a century after the death of the man who dubbed himself ""Caudillo"" (""Fuhrer""), the Spain governed by the children and grandchildren of the civil war bears few signs of the Franco legacy. More than 20 years of parliamentary democracy and a growing openness to the rest of the world have changed the face of Spain. 
Spain in 2000 will be curiously certain as to the role it wants to play: there will be none of the European doubts that there are in Britain> none of the tentativeness about foreign policy still to be found in Germany. Since June 1985, when Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist prime minister, signed the Spanish accession to the Eu, through to its current participation in monetary union, as ratified by the right-wing Jose Maria Aznar, each government has followed the same policy. All political parties have worked for a nation with a capitalist economy, firmly integrated into the institutions of the western world, and all want Spain to be an enthusiastic partner with Europe and with Latin America. The few remaining doubts about the inevitability of these policies have been raised, paradoxically, by more conservative thinkers, the heirs to Franco's power, rather than by Social Democrats. Indeed, the current ruling right-wing party abstained in Mr Gonzalez's referendum on entry into NaTO. Only a few months before coming into power, Mr Aznar had no qualms about declaring his opposition to the euro. Yet today he has emerged as one of its greatest supporters. 
Spaniards seem to feel that international alliances are the best antidote to the devils at home. Spain is anxious to anchor itself in other people's liberalism, lest the ghosts of 25 years ago return. The 20th century started badly for Spain with the loss of the remnants of its colonial empire and its defeat at the hands of the United States. A dogged introspection came into vogue, and Spain distanced itself from Europe. This exaggerated gloom of the past is the intellectual precursor of the equally exaggerated exuberance and internationalism of 2000. 
The enthusiasm shown by some Spanish business executives for globalisation has at times reached ridiculous extremes, with near neo-imperialist overtones. Spain, for example, has become one of the major international investors in Latin America. This has led to considerable resentment from the ruling classes in the so-called sister republics. They welcome the investment, but resent the arrogance of companies such as Telefonica and Endesa. Spain might be their mother country but mother is often best kept 3,000 miles away. 
Spaniards have exploited the unquestionable power of Castilian as the unifying language of more than 20 countries. The cultural unity of Latin America rests largely in the power of Spanish as a common language, in which there are none of the differences or divergences which, for example, separate American from British English. The growth of the Spanish-speaking population north of the Rio Grande gives rise to the hope that Spanish business people and intellectuals may now have an opportunity to flourish in the United States. A number of Spanish media companies are firmly ensconced on the other side of the Atlantic. Seeing this move, many companies from the Eu are now coming to Spain in order to gain a foothold there before leaping across the Atlantic to Latin America. Publishers provide a good example: Bertelsmann, Pearson, Havas and Hachette have all invested in Spain with an eye to the new world. 
The new Spain's global spirit has strange facets. While, for instance, it is considered a sign of modernity to admit to being a Basque, Catalan or Galician nationalist, the old Spanish nationalism hardly dares lift its head at home. It only shows its face, with the arrogance of old, in the American subcontinent. 
Juan Luis Cehrian: founder and publisher of El Pais  1999 After the natural disaster of 1999, a man-made recovery in 2000? Turkey will begin to get its inflationridden economy in order, helped by its first formal iMF agreement since the previous one collapsed in 1995. It cannot afford to do otherwise. 
The 1999 fiscal deficit ballooned into double digits as the economy went into recession and spending ran ahead of plan-first because of government largesse before early parliamentary elections, then as reconstruction got under way in the aftermath of the devastating August earthquake. Spending will have to be checked, but not at the expense of rebuilding the 60,000 homes that were destroyed or damaged in the earthquake. 
Only with speedy reconstruction can the government hope to take the edge off public anger over the authorities' ineptitude revealed by the earthquake. If this does not appear to be working, the government will not hesitate to resort to old-fashioned censorship. With many journalists, politicians and intellectuals already behind bars for no more than voicing their differences with the state, Turks are likely to get on with rebuilding their lives and leave politics to the same tired leaders who have been running the country for years. 
The justice system will come under further scrutiny as Abdullah Ocalan, the head of the Kurdish guerrilla movement, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, faces execution following his June 1999 conviction in a Turkish court. Before the death sentence can be carried out, parliament must approve it. The Turks have not executed anyone for 15 years. Mr Ocalan is, therefore, more likely to rot in jail. Not least, this would help Turkey's relations with the Eu to improve over the coming year. Formal accession talks will not start until human-rights problems are solved. Greece's long-time animosity will fade, but will not disappear altogether.  1999 In 2000, the countries that once loyally orbited the Soviet Union will have much to celebrate. A decade on from communism's demise across Central and Eastern Europe, they have firmly locked on to a new orbit around Brussels. Although hardly paragons of democracy and transparency, they have steered clear of the virulent crony capitalism that has infected Russia and most other former Soviet states. And, for the most part, their economies have proved resilient enough to pull through the Russian crisis and the war in Kosovo relatively unscathed. 
There is still far to go. Even among the frontrunners, such as Poland, Slovenia and Hungary, economic reforms are half finished at best and it is the most socially sensitive of these that have been postponed. Meanwhile, hopes for early entry to the Eu will be dashed again in 2000 despite renewed efforts to speed up the process. As a result, anti-western voices will grow louder. 
The economic picture is mixed, but generally positive. The Czech Republic, the region's fallen star, will start to grow again after two years of painful recession. Now that some of the past governments' sillier plans have been overhauled-including a botched privatisation programme that left insiders, or worse, no one, in control of companies-the economy should emerge more competitive and less prone to currency crashes than before. Still, it will be years before the Czechs can again claim star status in the eastern part of the continent. Overdue corporate restructuring may yet push unemployment over 10%. 
Poland will once again put in an impressive performance. After years of tigerish growth, the economy slowed in 1999, weighed down by the emergingmarkets' crisis. The pick-up it will experience in 2000, registering growth of 5%, will be a testament to its success in moving its trade towards the eurozone, where growth is once again reviving; one-third of Poland's exports now go to Germany alone. 
There is no call for smugness, however. Not even Poland is close to hitting the sort of growth rates that might bring living standards up to European Union levels within another 20 years. Moreover, 2000 will be the year that those countries at the front of the pack have to start grappling in earnest with the second stage of post-communist reform. 
Selling thousands of stateowned companies, cleaning up financial regulation and bringing inflation down to single digits are no mean feats, to be sure. However, the next stage will be even tougher. The region is still full of very big companies in heavy industries that make no profit but absorb plenty of public money. Now that political heads are finally emerging from the sand, the task will be to restructure these, at great cost to jobs, leaving smaller but more competitive industries in their wake. The list stretches from mining (a particular worry in Poland and Romania) to steel and defence. Such restructuring will strain some national budgets to breaking point: for all its economic dynamism, Poland cannot rule out a currency wobble in 2000. 
As governments tackle the most sodaily sensitive areas of economic reform, and jobs disappear in their thousands, public resentment will grow. This will manifest itself in increased scepticism towards integration with western clubs that are seen as driving those reforms, in particular the Eu. For ministers in Prague, Warsaw and Budapest, Eu membership remains the main foreign-policy objective. However, ordinary Central and East Europeans increasingly see the Eu as a protectionist clique that wants to prise open its applicants' markets but is prepared to concede little in return. 
Their distrust of Brussels will spread in 2000, as opponents of membership or those who want it delayed persuade voters that quick accession amounts to economic prostitution. Unease will also grow as it becomes clear that accession talks will get thornier as they advance. Although much ground has been covered, the rockiest areas-in particular agriculture-are yet to be properly discussed. The talks may not founder on farm trade, but they are certain to get heavily bogged down: one reason, perhaps, why the Eu remains reluctant to set firm admission dates for any of the six leading applicants (five from Eastern Europe, plus Cyprus). 
Economic nationalism will grow loudest in Poland. Support among Poles for joining the Eu is dwindling fast, down from 80% in 1996 to 55%. During 2000 that figure will keep falling, to below 50%, as parties that oppose Eu membership, such as the Christian Nationalists in the ruling coalition, strike a chord with the growing number of voters who worry that their country is rushing into a bad deal. The debate over whether Poland has let in too much foreign capital sparked by the sale of most big banks to foreigners, will also intensify. Foreign supermarket chains will come under fire for undermining small local shops. Politicians may be forced to listen. 
Anti-EU sentiment will not be limited to Poland. In Hungary too, there is strong opposition to selling land to foreigners, largely based on fears of German money flooding the market. In the Czech Republic, a kind of cultural nationalism is taking root as intellectuals increasingly criticise the ""mindless"" western films and television programmes that now dominate. Nor is the frustration directed solely at Brussels: in 2000, Eastern Europe's main stockmarkets will lose much of their best business to Frankfurt. 
Some good may come of this. In the mid-1990s, governments in Central and Eastern Europe were able to push through painful economic reforms by blaming them on the iMF. (""Not our fault. Either we do this or we don't get the money,"" and so on.) With the Eu becoming something of a bogeyman in Eastern Europe, the same governments might now be able to use it as a scapegoat for the latest bout of reforms. Take that too far, however, and the reward is entry to a club that your electorate is loth to join. 
Matthew Valencia: Eastern Europe correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Russia will look different next year, but not where it matters. By the end of 2000 Russia will have a new president, a new government, a new parliament and a new image. Its problems, however, will be much the same as before. (This will not bother the stockmarket-at least at first. Expect Russian asset prices to surge in the second half of the year, as outside investors start convincing themselves that the new political leadership makes this vast and cheap emerging market irresistible value.) 
It is true that Russia will sound and feel more consistently governed. The new lower house of parliament, elected (war and bombs permitting) on December 19th 1999, will prove less cantankerous and silly than the one elected four years ago. It will almost certainly get on better with the country's new president, due to be elected on July 3rd. That will avoid some of the crassest squabbles and confrontations of recent years. It will make it easier, for example, to adopt a more rational tax code (the current one offers a bleak choice between insolvency, if followed, and bribes to the tax inspector, if not). Other laws on, say, corporate governance, bankruptcy, or even private ownership of land could all go through. 
There will be other bits of good news. Foreign creditor countries, always willing to give Russia one last chance, will probably negotiate new terms (even a write-off) of the $42 billion state-to-state debt inherited from the Soviet Union. Coupled with a continued high oil price, and perhaps even a new Eurobond issue, that could make Russia's finances look misleadingly rosy. Foreign direct investors, in industries ranging from consumer goods to forestry, will reckon that Russia's 140m population and wealth of raw materials are worth a punt-especially if their investments are underwritten by western governments. 
But the boomlet will be deceptive. Although international goodwill, solvency and sensible laws may be necessary conditions for Russia to prosper, they are certainly not sufficient ones. The biggest problem, of ingrained lawlessness, is the result of centuries of bad government (first feudal, then communist) and will take a generation or more to change. 
This will continue to hit Russia at three levels. First, an alarming overlap between corrupt officials, gangsters and industrialists will remain the central feature of political and economic life. The growth-killing idea that a guaranteed big slice of a small pie is much better than a possible small slice of a much larger one is deeply rooted-and in Russia's dismal condition quite reasonably so. Russia's market will remain oligopolistic-meaning that there is competition of a sort, but only among the limited number of companies willing to bribe their way in. 
Second, Russian banking will remain stunted, unable to channel the country's savings into its industry. A legal system in which a bank can reliably collect the collateral on a bad loan, regardless of the debtor's location or political clout, is still many years away. Timid, underpaid judges inevitably favour powerful local interests. While that continues no sane bank is going to lend much long term. 
Third, everyday life in Russia will remain miserably backward and inefficient. You want a passport? Then go and queue for a couple of days (or slip someone a bribe). You want a driving licence? The same. Or to register your car, pass an exam, avoid military service, start a business? The same. In both the public and private sectors, promises and deadlines are for the most part unenforceable. Every minor inefficiency is somebody's livelihood. In happier coun tries, the public complains by writing to lawmakers or the newspapers-or there may even be an ombudsman, free legal advice or easily accessible courts. Not much sign of that starting in Russia. 
It was these problems that wrecked Russia's economy in 1998. This time the cycle of illusion and disillusion will be shorter. The new authorities will certainly proclaim that a new law-abiding era has begun. There will probably be some show-trials for those figures from the past who have failed to make the necessary arrangements (emigration or switching sides being the two most obvious). But soon enough-by 2001 at the latest-it will be clear that the changes are superficial, and that Russia remains, at heart, as morally and financially bankrupt as before. Investors, remembering how badly they were caught out in 1998, will stampede for the exit. 
Does it matter? Yes. Another crash will underline Russia's isolation from the rest of the world and highlight the gulf opening up, seemingly inexorably, between the eastern and western halves of the post-communist world. 
Edward Lucas: Russia correspondent, 
The Economist.  1999 Like Russia's economy, foreign policy will be deceptive. Under a new president, whether it is the portly Yevgeny Primakov or the steely Vladimir Putin (the latter was President Boris Yeltsin's favourite in late 1999), or some other candidate, the style will be more vigorous and assertive. Alcohol, illness and old age made every public appearance by Mr Yeltsin risky, and sometimes outright humiliating. 
President X will have foreign policy ideas of his own, and will take to the world stage to promote them. This will be something of a shock for western policymakers, used to Russia's role in recent years as a grumpy, unreliable but largely untroublesome force in world affairs. Where Russia still has a few cards to play-with nuclear weapons, or against its even weaker neighboursexpect tough bargaining. The biggest tussle will be over the future of the former captive nations, especially in Central Asia and the Caucasus, and possibly the Baltic states. 
Bad news? Not really. Although some alarmists will talk of a new cold war whenever a row flares up, Russia is so weak that it can advance its interests only if the West loses its nerve. Money matters most to Russia's rulers. Sound and fury are all very well (and so is friendship, although there are few takers on the western side for that now) but making sure that the country stays integrated into the world economy, so as to sell oil, gas, gold and diamonds, to borrow and launder money, and to pay for imports of consumer goods, is most important of all. 
Look beyond the central authorities' stroppiness, and another trend-the decentralisation of foreign policy-will become more visible in 2000. GovernorsRussia's powerful regional barons-are often unsavoury or incompetent (or both). But the brighter ones have already begun to realise the benefits of foreign investment. 
The scores of regional commercial representatives already based abroad will grow in importance. If you want to deal with the men who matter in a country, you end up talking to their representatives. The regions have no nuclear weapons, but on most other questions, the governors' words will count for more, and the central government's for a lot less.  1999 Decommissioning of Ulster's terrorist weapons should be completed by May. Completed? The question is whether the IRA will have started. 
Tony Blair in 2000 will preside over the final destruction of the traditional British constitution. Neither he nor anyone else knows what will emerge in its place. 
The old constitution was highly centralised. In contrast to most democratic countries, there were no autonomous centres of political power. The prime minister and cabinet controlled the legislature. The absence of a written constitution and a bill of rights meant that the courts lacked the power to strike down acts of parliament. Local government was a creature of central government. There was no regional or provincial tier of government at all. 
Centralisation on this scale exhibited all the usual vices: delay, rigidity, excessive uniformity and a tendency towards ""the universalisation of error"", but it had one virtue. Centralisation of power meant centralisation of responsibility. The buck stopped at Westminster. When things went wrong, the British people knew who to blame. If they wanted to throw the rascals out, they knew precisely who the rascals were-as John Major discovered the hard way in 1997. 
No longer. National governments will still come and go, but they now have rivals. The last year of the old millennium saw the setting up of a largely autonomous Scottish parliament and a less autonomous-but still potentially pesky-Welsh assembly. The first year of the new millennium will see the process taken further. 
In early May, London-which has not had a metropolis-wide political authority since Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London Council in 1986-will elect for the first time its own executive mayor as well as a representative city council. The new authority's powers are limited; education, for example, will remain in the hands of the capital's 32 boroughs. But from May 2000 onwards London, like Paris, Berlin and Brussels, will have a highly visible presence in national politics. 
The practice of electing executive mayors, new to Britain, will begin to take hold in 2000 as big cities start to hold referendums to decide whether to adopt a mayoral system. Several will conclude that they should elect prominent local boys and girls whom non-locals, especially in Whitehall, will take seriously. The effect will be the rise of a new class of subnational politicians with large budgets and, more important, ample street cred. Britain will soon have its own Brandts, Chiracs, Daleys and Giulianis. 
The missing tier of regional government is already being partially filled in by Scotland and Wales. In 2000 the English regions will move, cautiously at first, in the same direction. All the regions now have development agencies and indirectly elected regional chambers or assemblies, representing local authorities, business and the trade unions. Some of them will be content for now to remain talking shops, but at least three-those in the north-east, north-west and southwest-will press for direct elections and substantial powers. 
At Westminster, the House of Commons, never one of the world's more powerful legislatures, will continue to dwindle in importance. Prime minister's question time-always more highly regarded by viewers of America's C-Span than by the folks back home-will continue to provide light entertainment on Wednesday afternoons. (Both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, if no one else, will continue to take it seriously.) Elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster life will ebb away, with Mrs spending longer and longer weekends in their constituencies, the chamber itself mostly empty and Commons committees influential, if at all, only at the margins. 
The House of Lords, a charming but normally sleepy body, is going to provide Mr Blair and his colleagues with their one serious in-house headache. The Lords, already shorn in 1999 of most of their 600-strong hereditary element, will require in 2000 to be ""reformed"". The government is committed to reform and by January 2000 will have received a royal commission report detailing proposals for change. How the government deals with the commission's report will constitute a major test of its modernising credentials. 
But the biggest single constitutional change of 2000 will occur on Monday October 2nd. On that day, the Human Rights Act, effectively incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Britain's domestic law, will come into force. The immediate effect will be to enable British citizens who believe their rights have been violated to litigate in the United Kingdom instead of Strasbourg; but the more significant longterm effect will be to tilt the balance of power in the British system towards the courts. Much litigation under the new act will be aimed directly at the government itself. Moreover, although the courts will not, strictly speaking, be able to strike down acts of parliament, they will have the power to embarrass ministers by pointing to discrepancies between the new act and all existing and future legislation. 
Mr Blair thus sees power slipping away from Whitehall to Scotland, Wales, the courts and the various new regional and local institutions. The House of Lords in its new guise-whatever that turns out to be-is bound to become more assertive. The Eu already acts as an effective check on British ministers. 
Unsurprisingly under the circumstances, Mr Blair will use 2000 to consolidate his hold on what remains-quite a lot-of British central power. Ministers will have to take even more notice than they already do of the views of the Cabinet Office and the Downing Street policy unit, which, taken together, already constitute a prime minister's department in all but name. 
The British constitution used to look like an elegant pyramid, with power supported at the base but exercised at the top. By the end of 2000 it will look more like an unfinished building designed by a slightly dotty architect. 
Anthony King: professor of government at Essex University: election commentator for the eec and regular contributor to the Daily Telegraph.  1999 The British economy is looking more invincible with each month that goes by. Britain used to stagger like a drunken sailor from crisis to crisis, but now it has by far the strongest public finances in Europe. Its monetary arrangements are singled out by the tMF as a model for other European countries. The financial markets apparently share the IMF's confidence in Britain's macroeconomic stability. Sterling has been the world's second strongest currency since 1995 and 30-year interest rates are now lower in Britain than they are in Germany or the United States. 
At first sight this all seems too good to be true. Most people in Britain are natural sceptics. As they survey the state of the British economy, the natural inclination is to wonder whether things can really be as good as they seem. After all, Britain has an unemployment rate second only to America's among the G7 countries. Inflation has been within 0.5% of the government's chosen target throughout the past two years. There ic a cast-iron fiscal position and a universally admired monetary framework. 
All this means that the British economy will continue to do well in the next few years. What is more doubtful is whether it will continue to outperform almost all other oEcD countries as impressively as it has done since 1994. For Britain is now entering the phase of the economic cycle in which performance depends less on the skilful management of monetary and fiscal policy than on the economy's underlying structural strengths. And contrary to widespread belief, it is in macroeconomic management that the British economy has lately been particularly successful, whereas Britain's underlying competitive structure still leaves a lot to be desired. 
Let us begin with the good news. Britain has done extremely well since 1993 by the standard criteria of economic analysis. And, just as it was possible to predict that Britain would cope in 1998 and 1999 with the challenges of the strong pound and the emerging markets' crisis, it can now be said with reasonable confidence that Britain will remain one of the healthiest economies in the world in 2000 and beyond. 
The economy will grow by at least 3% in 2000, pushing it even further up the league of industrialised nations to a position very close to that of France. Interest rates will doubtless rise in the year ahead-perhaps to a level somewhat higher than the 7% currently discounted in financial markets. Inflation will remain very subdued because of a structural upsurge of price competition in many British markets which have been cartelised for decades. 
In the second half of 2000 the pound may retreat a bit against the euro as a result of the widening deficit in the balance of payments and the accelerating recovery in Europe. But any such move should be modest, since the deficit itself is likely to stabilise at around 2% of cDr and then shrink gradually as domestic demand in Europe expands. Moreover, the pound's retreat will probably come after a period of even greater strength. In fact, before the upswing that began in 1996 is over, the pound should test its 1988 high point of DM3.25, equivalent to =L0.60. 
Sitting pretty on a fence 
The strength of the pound, along with the public's ambivalence towards Europe, will ensure that Tony Blair will continue to sit on the fence with regard to European Monetary Union (EMU) as he prepares for the next general election in early 2001. Thus a decision on abolishing the pound and joining the single currency is unlikely to be made in the period immediately after the 2001 election. More probably, the whole question of EMU membership will be put off again until Mr Blair's third parliamentary term, from around 2005 to 2009. Given the time required for a referendum and then to make practical monetary arrangements, Britain seems very unlikely to join the single currency for at least another seven years. For practical purposes, therefore, EMU should probably be ignored as an operative factor. Interestrate decisions in Europe will not have much influence on monetary policies in Britain. Speculation about an entry rate for the pound in ENtu will have less and less impact on currency investors. And prudent businesses should make their decisions on investment and trade with Britain on the assumption that the pound will continue to float. 
This freedom from arbitrary constraints on economic policy should be helpful to Britain. Since there is no reason to believe that the Bank of England and the Treasury will suddenly lose the skills in demand management which they have developed since the mid1990s, Britain should outperform its more constrained European neighbours-especially Germany-when it comes to keeping both unemployment and inflation under good control. 
Having said all this, however, there must now be some serious questions about how long Britain can keep its economic lead, especially as other European countries learn from Britain's successes and start to adopt more active monetary and fiscal policies to manage demand. Once this begins to happen the great irony of the British economic miracle may start to be understood. Britain's economic success is usually attributed to its flexible labour markets, its competitive markets, its strong entrepreneurship and its dynamic, liberal financial sector. But this image of humming efficiency in the supply-side engine room of the British economy does not accord with the country's relatively poor statistics on productivity growth. The truth is that the transformation of Britain's economic performance has so far been due mainly to skilful demand management. The widely discussed improvements in Britain's supply side have been less apparent. 
Productivity growth has hardly accelerated in Britain since the mid-1980s and has continued to lag far behind the rates achieved in Germany and France. That this is not just a statistical illusion is suggested by anecdotal comparisons of market structures and corporate performance in Britain and other countries. Far from being a free-market entrepreneurial paradise, Britain actually seems to suffer from more cartelised markets with much higher prices than the rest of Europe. It has fewer small businesses than other European countries; and the City of London, even though it remains the world's leading centre for international finance, is notably weak in supporting financial innovation within Britain. British-owned companies, in sectors ranging from engineering, chemicals and computer services to retailing, entertainment, banking and insurance, have generally proved weak competitors in global markets. More and more have succumbed to foreign takeovers. The undoubted strength of the economy in 2000 will not disguise the many weaknesses that remain. 
Anatole Kaletsky: columnist on The Times and director of Kaletsky Economic Consulting.  1999 There will be a great effusion of what passes for British warmth and emotion on August 4th 2000, when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother turns 100. Unlike the media hype that will go with it, this warmth will be genuine. The Queen Mother is Britain's ""favourite royal"". She has served her country well, most notably standing by her notoriously shy and uncertain husband, King George VI, during the second world war. More recently she has developed the image, with a bright smile and flowery hat, of being everybody's perfect grandmother, or rather, great grandmother. She will be one of about 8,800 Britons to be 100 or over; a reminder of today's longevity. Like all of them she will receive a message of congratulations from her daughter at Buckingham Palace.  1999 Rising crime, hopeless transport, declining services, agricultural crisis-why would anyone want to live in the English countryside? And yet people do: in such large numbers that house-building has become another in the litany of woes afflicting rural areas. According to government calculations, 3.8m new homes must be built in England by 2021 to keep pace with the changing pattern of domestic life. Fine. But nobody has yet solved the question of where to put them. 
On the face of it, it may seem strange that this demand should exist when the British population is more or less stable at 59m. But government demographers base their calculations on changes to the way we live. More and more young people pursue higher education, choosing, in the curious British tradition, universities that are often far away from the parental home. When they finish their studies, they do not return to the nest. Later in life, a third of them will marry and divorce, forcing one partner to set up in a new home. Even the otherwise happy fact that people are living longer has its downside: fewer properties are being released back on to the market through death. Added to these internal changes in demography is the potentially explosive issue of immigration. Official statisticians used to assume that net immigration would fall to zero. Recent figures allow for immigration to rise to an annual net level of 65,000, remaining at that figure until 2036. This alone would create the need for half a million new homes by 2016. Though ministers are loth to discuss such a sensitive matter, and it has generally escaped public attention, the newcomers put extra pressure on the stock of available housing. 
For most of the 1990s, the British domestic property market has been in the doldrums. This has allowed successive governments to put the issue of building new homes from their minds. Building companies were more likely to go bankrupt than embark on ambitious new projects. But in 1999 low interest rates set house prices in southern England fizzing. Soon, no doubt, the chancellor of the exchequer will want to put the cork back into the champagne bottle, but he will find the task even more difficult than did his predecessors if interest rates decline towards European levels. In 2000 prices will probably continue to gush higher, particularly in and around millennium-mad London. House-builders will push hard to be allowed to provide the new homes that are said to be needed, because of the big money to be made from them. The controversial Crow report supports plans to build 1.1m homes in the south-east by 2016. Ashford, Crawley, Milton Keynes and Stansted are targeted for expansion. Councils have vowed opposition. What has been done to ready the planning system for the onslaught? 
The last housing boom came in the early 1980s, when the then Tory government mistakenly believed that the free market would solve the problem. There is not, however, a free market in housing. As a mature country, England and Wales have been subject to planning restrictions since the Middle Ages. By selectively relaxing certain planning controls, the To
ries permitted a rash of low-quality developments, crammed into or around the edges of villages, left floating as detached blobs in the countryside or scrambled into the urban chaos of London's Docklands. 
Margaret Thatcher, when prime minister, had a faith in the motor car as an expression of personal freedom, which meant that many of these 1980s 
developments were inadequately served by public transport. Some ministers of the environment encouraged developers to create new settlements that would provide a large number of dwellings, but they met such public 
resistance that no significant example was actually built. In planning, Thatcherism was a disaster. 
Now, John Prescott, as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, is attempting to promote a new vision. Ironically, given that he is a Labour minister and Old Labour at that, many of his ideas were pioneered by the Prince of Wales, who persuaded the Duchy of Cornwall to create the model settlement of Poundbury Farm, on the edge of Dorchester. Poundbury Farm is an attempt to rediscover the pleasure of urban living, with a far higher density of people per acre than the suburban norm. Residential, commercial and public buildings are mixed together, so that nothing should be more than a stroll away. These blessings could be conferred on some of our existing towns, Mr Prescott and his team believe, if more of the derelict land that makes them disfunction could be developed. On coming into office, he boldly announced that two-thirds of the 3.8m new homes would be built on these brown sites. 
Enter Richard Rogers, newly ennobled architect of the Pompidou Centre, the Lloyd's building and other monumenu to a whizzy technological future. Made chairman of an ""Urban Task Force"", he was charged with quantifying the amount of brown land that exists and has not found enough of it. He judges that it could not accommodate more than half the required homes. Furthermore, it is often in the wrong place-plentiful in Sunderland and the other post-industrial towns of the north, scarce in popular and scenic retirement counties such as Devon. The Rogers solution is to promote a vision of urban renaissance, strikingly similar to that of the Prince of Wales's guru, Leon Krier. It may be no coincidence that Lord Rogers is partly Italian and Mr Krier comes from Luxembourg. Both want to persuade the British public to behave more like continentals, for whom vibrant city culture is more fulfiling than rural isolation. The key to it is forcing motor traffic-particularly commuter cars-out of towns. Unfortunately for the urban idealists, Tony Blair gives every sign of being unimpressed. Voters like cars. Middle England is not yet ready to exchange its invincible green suburbs for a Barcelona-style existence. The pressure for house-building exists in the traditionally Tory and Liberal heartlands of the home counties and the south-west. Labour finds the instincts of the people who live in these areas difficult to fathom. In the year ahead, however, it will hear their complaints mounting in volume and anger.  1999 Dogs and cats from Europe will finally be allowed to walk straight through immigration into Britain-passport in paw. 
Will Britons be healthier, wealthier, wiser or happier in 2000? Patterns of social and economic change are rarely obvious to the anecdotal observer from one year to the next. Yet statistics constantly remind us how much we differ from our former selves in family life, work, leisure and the issues that concern us. Rising prosperity, technological progress, the breakdown of traditional social structures and the influence of (often Americanised) media are stealthily turning many of us into new people. But they are also creating new divides, between those who are changing and those who are left behind. 
Take health, for example: awareness of the health implications of diet and exercise rose steadily through the 1990s, and will continue to grow. More hours will be spent in the gym by both men and women, and health club chains will remain a fast-expanding business sector. With concerns about the safety of beef lingering in the consumer's mind (even after most scientists have withdrawn their reservations) we will eat more chicken and less red meat; more fruit and less dairy produce. Food retailers will compete to emphasise the ""naturalness"" of their produce, and the absence of anything genetically modified. Yet obesity-an indication both of rising affluence and of dietary ignorance-will also continue to rise, afflicting more than 20% of adults: more than four women in five will admit to a wish to lose 10kg. 
Smoking will continue to decline among the middle classes, and will become almost universally unacceptable in offices, restaurants and public buildings. Political correctness will rule on this and many other matters (even extending to the suppression of the word ""British"" by the sBC in favour of ""UK diversity""). Yet incorrectness will manifest itself in just as many ways. Smoking will remain prevalent among young working-class women, who will also drink more alcohol than they used to. Influenced by ""laddish"" role models such as radio presenter Zoe Ball (whom 86% of teenage girls in a recent poll identified as the person they would most like to be, even though Ms Ball herself may be taking time off in 2000 to be a wife and mother), young women will increasingly see it as their right to behave as badly as young men. And incidences of ""road rage"" and other forms of in-your-face aggression-perpetrated by both men and women-will continue to rise. 
As for family life, there will be less than half as many first marriages in 2000 as there were a generation ago, and two marriages out of five will be remarriages. More than a quarter of adult women under 50 will be cohabiting. More than a third of all children will be born out of wedlock (four times the number of a generation ago) and in some ethnic minorities more than half; more than six births in a hundred will be to teenage mothers. Perhaps reflected in those statistics are some other measurable trends: more women will be ""economically active"" in 2000 (though many will be working only part-time) but the number of men in any form of work will be in long-term decline. People in all forms of office work will tend to work longer hours (and take shorter lunch breaks) and more people in all kinds of work will be subject to the pressures of being selfemployed, rather than collecting a company wage. 
As a result of all these factors, more than 50% of men will consider themselves, at some time in their lives, to be suffering from stress or depression. Meanwhile, more than half of the population will go through the year without any participation in religious activity. By choice or otherwise, modern Britons will have to fend for themselves with much less in the way of family, corporate or spiritual support. 
Will children suffer from this disintegration of traditional structures? The statistics do not tell us directly, but they do show that the children of 2000 will spend ten times as much time watching television as reading books, and that 15% of them will leave primary school unable to read or write. Yet school test results will almost certainly continue to improve, and 2 1/2 times as many of the youngsters of 2000 as in their parents' generation will go on to university. 
Britons will abide by at least some of their old faiths in 2000. One is football, for which it will be ever more fashionable for the professional classes to display an enthusiasm. The other is bricks and mortar: relatively low mortgage rates combined with rising earnings will fuel a property boom, and ""equity withdrawal"" will continue to fund other kinds of consumer spending-on foreign holidays, electronic gadgetry, exotic eating out and Manchester United season tickets, for example. Reflecting rising wealth, there will be more second homes-many of them in France. The success of socalled ""makeover television"", in programmes such as ""Changing Rooms"" and ""Ground Force"" will fuel a continuing obsession with home improvement. 
In summary, Britain in 2000 will be richer, fitter and more sophisticated in its technology and tastes. In many fields, women will be in the ascendant. But it will also be a lonelier, more atomistic society, in which traditional pillars of support are atrophying away. And it will be divided: the gulf of incomprehension will widen between the wired and the unwired, the made-over and the unreconstructed, the young and the old. Most significantly in political terms, a gulf will widen between rural and urban Britain. Economically disadvantaged farming and village communities, devoted to the old-fashioned pursuits of fox-hunting, church-going and family life, will see themselves as threatened and shunned by self-confident, second-home-owning, mobile-phone-equipped, politically correct townies. That division, stridently expressed, will be the clearest of all illustrations of the changing nature of the Britons of 2000. 
Martin Vander Weyer: associate editor of The Week.  1999 Chris Patten, Europe's new commissioner for external relations, reflects on the lasting strength of liberal ideas. 
The countdown to the millennium has been accompanied by list-making on an heroic scale-best of these, worst of those. Who, for example, have been the greatest thinkers of the century, or the full thousand years? Who has shaped the world, or rather who has shaped it for better, not worse? 
Most of the lists try to balance the political philosophers, economists and leaders of the left against those of the right. Ideas, apparently, have to be served up on the basis of ""on one hand, on the other"". But if we are concerned about ideas that have survived and prospered, why include Marx and his progeny of Socialist divines? 
The totalitarianism of the left, so frequently investing the mad wickedness of tyrants with a spurious intellectualism, has earned its place in the history books by the death, misery and poverty it caused. Modern scholarship has shredded what were once argued to be the modest triumphs of Leninism. 
So who from the left deserves to be garlanded on the grounds of continuing relevance? The Marxist empire whether of ideas or of military occupation-has collapsed in Europe. 
Socialism in Asia has transmuted into the robber-baron capitalism of China. Those British prophets of socialism, Tawney and the Webbs, are no longer the intellectual godparents of Africa's development economists. Where guerrillas and terrorists still breed in jungles and slums, they are more likely to be motivated by ethnic hatred, nasty populism and the ideals of the Mafia than by the ideas of the old left. 
Even the contribution of social democracy-Dick Crosland, Willy Brandt and all those who sought to civilise rather than overthrow capitalism-is today a questionable commodity. In Britain, the Labour Party's makeover signals the death of any attempt to justify a programme of public ownership and redistribution. New Labour and its Third Way (in one American critic's phrase, ""opportunism with a human face""), recognises that policies and ideas that once promoted social solidarity now help produce social alienation. The challenge in a Europe where the jobless queues stretch around the block is how to strip away the regulation and limit the state intervention that have helped to gum up our economies. 
My own chance progress from Hong Kong to Brussels has strengthened my sense that the intellectual survivors of this century are the champions of the liberal order that was born in the last, those who understood the strong and comprehensive relationship between political pluralism and open markets. 
I lived through a time, when governor of Hong Kong, in which some Asian leaders and many of those who invested in their myth, claimed that the liberal order was not universally valid. It was, they asserted, a western cultural import, rendered irrelevant and out of date by the rediscovery of a value system that drew allegedly on Confucius and justified crony capitalism and authoritarian government. 
The Asian miracle was the cocky answer to the democratic activists and the advocates of transparency and clean government. Question the so-called Asian values and you were pointed towards the cranes, the towering office blocks and the marbled hotel lobbies. 
I was lucky to sail away from Hong Kong the day before the Thai baht crashed, the Asian economies tumbled, and the vanities of authoritarians and their business buddies were deflated. One conventional wisdom arrived as rapidly as its predecessor departed. From Seoul to Bangkok, governments and others understood the relationship between political and economic reform. 
Clean financial regulation, openness and the rule of law became Asia's watchwords. The Asian crash and subsequent recovery have reasserted the validity of classical liberal ideas everywhere. 
Europe can't boast 
That is not a bit of western bragging, less still a European crow. Europe's miserable history for too much of the past century has been the story of liberal values trampled in the mud. No European politician can claim that a belief in markets and moderation is distinctively and uniquely associated with our own conduct of political and economic affairs. 
But despite our own apostasy, liberal values did survive in our continentthanks in part to the generous and visionary leadership of the United States, and to the huge success of Europe's evolving Union. When I left Asia, it seemed to me that a main challenge to the Eu would be how much we would be prepared to stand up for and support proponents of the market economy and democracy in Asia. But now I wonder whether our main challenges may not be rather closer to home. 
How are we to respond to the Europe beyond the Union's boundaries, where many nations desire to join the Brussels club precisely because it best exemplifies the liberal order? How are we to rescue the Balkans from irreversible descent into ancient hatreds and future miseries? How can we assist Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states to build open societies under democratic government. How do we associate the poor countries to our south, along the Mediterranean's shore, with our economic success and political stability? 
What is plain is that we will not be guided philosophically in any of these tasks by the gurus of the left. If we want to know who are likely to be the most influential thinkers of the 21st century, we need look no further than the writers of this century who did most to defend and promote the liberal agenda of the recent past. They have been vindicated. Hayek and Popper, for example, will be of more use during the adventures ahead than any of Socialism's advocates, who will lie forgotten as the millennium turns.  1999 Britain in 2000 will again play host to the world's most exuberant non-stop classical musical festival. The festival has no headquarters, no organisation and no name, but it also has no rivals. Musicloving Brits take it for granted. But foreigners are amazed by it-and increasingly book their tickets from Berlin and Bergamo. 
Pick a date in 2000: say, February 2nd. There is nothing at all special about that date (which happens to be a Wednesday). But that is the whole point. 
On February 2nd the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Emanuel Ax will perform the Brahms D minor piano concerto in London's Royal Festival Hall, followed by a suite from William Walton's score for Laurence Olivier's wartime classic, ""Henry V"". Meanwhile, across the Thames in the Barbican Hall, the London Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Boulez will be playing Boulez's own music together with Stravinsky's Petrushka,the Schoenberg piano concerto (with Daniel Barenboim as soloist) and the world premiere of a new work by the British composer George Benjamin. Anyone not in the mood for orchestral music that night can opt instead for Mitsuko Uchida's piano recital at the Wigmore Hall. 
Opera-lovers are also spoilt for choice on February 2nd. At the newly reopened Royal Opera House, Gianluigi Gelmetti conducts a performance of Otello-no, not the one by Verdi, the much more rarely performed version by Rossini. Less than a mile to the west, at the London Coliseum, the English National Opera that evening will perform another Italian opera-Puccini's La Bohemebut this time in English translation. 
Needless to say, no one planned February 2nd's lush musical offerings. No higher authority decreed which works should be performed or where. Autonomous opera companies, orchestras and impresarios took autonomous decisions. The result will be, as usual, a joyous-and unrivalled-cacophony. An equally wide range of offerings will be available on every evening save one in 2000. Only on December 25th will the national score read tacet. 
Moreover, Britain's year-long festival without a name is not confined to London. Despite Sir Simon Rattle's move to Berlin, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra will continue to flourish in 2000 under its new Finnish conductor, Sakari Oramo. Birmingham's six-yearold Symphony Hall boasts acoustics as fine as any in Europe. 
Further north, Manchester's Bridgewater Hall is home to the city's Halle Orchestra, which fell on hard times during the 1990s but will enjoy a revival in 2000 under its new music director, Mark Elder. Mr Elder is the most experienced of a generation of able British conductors that includes Mark Wigglesworth, Paul Daniel and the young Daniel Harding as well as Sir Simon. 
Opera in the English north will be served in 2000 by the Leeds-based company Opera North, Scotland by Scottish Opera, Wales by the Welsh National Opera, the whole of Britain by Glyndebourne Touring Opera. The ssc maintams orchestras in the north of England, Scotland and Wales as well as the ssc Symphony Orchestra in London. One of the ornaments of Glasgow's cultural life is the Royal Scottish National Orchestra with its Russian conductor, Alexander Lazarev. Another Russian, the violinist Dmitry Sitkovetsky, leads the Ulster Orchestra in Belfast. 
England was once famously dismissed as ""the land without music"", Das Land ohne Musik. England-Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland-will all in 2000 be alive to the sound of music.  1999 In May, on the south side of the Thames, the Tate Gallery will open in the transformed Bankside Power Station. A dramatic home for the Tate's collection of 20th-century art. 
Linking the new Tate with St Paul's Cathedral and the Globe Theatre in Southwark will be the first pedestrian bridge to span the Thames in central London for over a century. It will feel the weight of 4m pairs of feet a year. The British Museum, which attracts some 6m visitors a year, completes a startling renovation with its entire inner courtyard under glass. London's museums have long looked tattier and less loved than their American counterparts. Here, at last, is an improvement. 
Watch out for the arrival of the Gilbert Silver Collection to the newly restored Somerset House (itself a marvel). The gift of Sir Arthur Gilbert, born in London in 1913, the collection, which until recently was on loan to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, comprises some 800 works. It will be permanently on view as of May. 
The world's largest observation whee and the city's fourth-tallest structure will open; it will sweep the skyline at 135 metres, allowing visitors unrivalled bird's eye views of London and beyond. 
Oh yes, the Millennium Dome. It will open amid much hullabaloo. Some of its displays will be intriguing, some tawdry. But this is not something that will swell Londoners' pride. 
There will be a newly elected mayor. Less expensive than the dome but perhaps as big an eyesore.  1999 The 2000th anniversary of Christianity should give ample opportunity for Catholics and Protestants to be encouraged to renew their faith, as church attendance levels around the world continue to fall. Moreover, the year is also the 26th Holy Year, or Jubilee, for Roman Catholics. Holy Years have been announced every 25 years since 1300. 
Many of the religious plans to celebrate the millennium are overt in their commercialism. Some of the projects endorsed by religious leaders have been unorthodox to say the least. Take, for example, the ""Clean the Slate"" campaign in the United Kingdom, endorsed by the Chief Rabbi and the Bishop of London among others, which aims to have a million sins confessed by the end of the millennium. People of all faiths are asked to send details of their transgressions to a post office box in Oxford, or confess them on radio chat-shows. 
In the Vatican the plans are more high-tech. Catholic organisers hope that 13m credit-card devices will be sold to millennium visitors, which will store credit for a wide range of uses from entry to events to phone calls. But then arrangements in the Vatican need to be very slick to cope with the 30m pilgrims expected to visit the holy city. L5 billion ($8 billion) has been spent on preparations for the millennium. 
For Protestants around the world, June will see the millennial version of the annual ""March for Jesus"". Expect 30m Christians on the streets but little media coverage. They will be happy celebrants, in contrast to the thousands of pilgrims suffering ""messianic madness"" in Israel. The year is so significant that many pilgrims will be expecting the Battle of Gog and Magog, and even the second coming of Jesus. A security unit to deal with such problems has been set up and includes agents from Shin Bet and Mossad. 
Health permitting, the pope plans to visit the Holy Land. This will be the first papal visit since 1964. However, it is likely to stir up old conflicts about the status of the cities in the Holy Land. The Vatican believes that Jerusalem should have special status as a religious centre under international guarantee, a proposition which offends Israelis, who see Jerusalem as the country's eternal and undivided capital. The pope will probably visit Nazareth, also an Israeli city, and Bethlehem, part of the Palestinian self-rule territories. 
The problems of the Church of England-worrying about where to find 35,000 bell-ringers for January 1st and the wording of the service in the Millennium Dome-pale in comparison.  1999 It is always dangerous to proclaim that companies from one particular country are on top. In 1989 a Japanese member of parliament, Shintaro Ishihara, bragged ""There is no hope for the United States."" At the same time, various American academics lauded Japan's tradition of industrial planning. The Harvard Business Review hailed the country's ""unsurpassed"" financial regulators. And a rash of books seemed to imply that most of California would end up as a subsidiary of Matsushita. Since then, Japan's share of the world's stockmarket capitalisation has shrunk from 40% to around a tenth. 
Nowadays the same air of invincibility surrounds American companies. ""Dot.com"" books with pictures of T-skirted geeks have taken the place of all those worthy tributes to kaizen. Flexibility, speed, inventiveness, ruthlessness are just a few of the virtues that are deemed to be innately American. In Fortune's annual list of the world's most admired companies, the top ten firms in 1999 all came from the United States; and there were only three non-Americans-Sony, Toyota and DaimlerChrysler-in the top 25. 
Has everybody got it wrong again? The broad answer is no. Even if you think that the American stockmarket is overvalued, even if you are sceptical about the ""new economy"", American firms are still, by most measures of competitiveness, beating the Bejesus out of their peers. Yet there are a few signs in Europe (and to a lesser extent in Japan) that firms are beginning to learn how to fight back. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, the coming year may not be the beginning of the end of American domination; but it might just be the end of the beginning. 
Start with the presumption that in business, even more than politics, the only constant thing is change. One method by which American firms caught up with their Japanese peers (assuming that they were ever behind in the first place, which is another debate) was by copying them. All those books about total quality management and lean production had an effect. Can the Europeans and Japanese catch up too? Today, the superiority of the Americans is evident but it is not universal. There are a few industries (luxury goods, for instance, in the case of Europe; consumer electronics for Japan) where the Americans are still behind. And in some ""neutral"" geographic territories, non-Americans are also doing pretty well. Japanese firms have a strong position in developing Asia, European ones in Latin America. 
The Americans are ahead overall because, first, they are leaner than their peers; and, second, they have embraced new technology. Buoyed by fads like re-engineering, American firms spent much of the early 1990s slimming not just their blue-collar workforce but also their managerial ranks; and they have kept on slimming and outsourcing jobs to other places. By contrast, in Europe and Japan, companies have, depending on your point of view, been kinder, lazier, unfairly restrained by their governments or simply true to their stakeholder principles. Although sales growth in Europe has broadly kept pace with America, profit margins in continental Europe are roughly half those in America. 
But there are signs of change. Already investment bankers are talking about European firms taking a much more aggressive, ""American"" approach to mergers and acquisitions. Certainly, European giants such as Daimler-Benz (now DaimlerChrysler) and Fiat that might once have considered themselves invulnerable, have begun to lop off ""noncore"" operations. Shareholder activism is on the rise in Europe; so is performancerelated pay. 
American firms have always been able to sell to 250m people on their doorstep. Now, thanks to the single market and the single currency, European firms should be able to reap similar economies of scale. Compared with America, Europe has twice as many car makers, eight times as many rail-engine manufacturers and ten times as many tractor and battery makers. 
Ten years ago there was much talk about how Japanese firms had a technological edge over the West. That now seems laughable. Not only do American firms dominate most of the well-known high-tech industries like computers, biotechnology and software, but even in more humdrum industries, like plastics and construction, American companies have been quicker to embrace both the Internet and e-commerce. 
But Europe in particular is not without hope. In pharmaceuticals, the continent is America's equal. There are a few parts of the continent-Finland for instance-that are actually more wired than America. And in one increasingly crucial technology, wireless telephony, Europe enjoys a sizable lead, thanks to firms like Nokia, Ericsson and VodafoneAirtouch, and the pervasiveness of the GsM standard. Europe and Japan, which is also ahead of America, will be the first two markets to introduce a common global standard. As the Internet migrates to ""smart"" hand-held devices, that could give the non-Americans a spur. 
Continental Europe is a morass of interfering regulators, high taxes and inflexible rules. Even were a French business leader to emerge who had the technological brain of Bill Gates and the restructuring zeal of Jack Welch, what could he or she do to get round the country's new 35-hour week? Or the Eu's social charter? 
These rules have long been the American businessman's best friend. European leaders like to insist that the shackles are coming off-even in Paris ""regulation"" has become something of a dirty word-but there is a need to hurry. The consultants at McKinsey reckon that only a fifth of world output, or $6 trillion out of $28 trillion, is at present globally contestable-that is, open to global competition in products, service or ownership. But within 30 years, as various economies (for example, China and India) and industries (retail and financial services) open up, four-fifths of the world economy will be global. That is the prize that the rest of the world's business leaders need to try and wrest away from American companies. But they had better get a move on. 
John Micklethwait: New York bureau chief, The Economist. Co-author, ""A Future Perfect: The Essentials of Globalisation"". published in 2000.  1999 It will be a bruising year for car companies, which are still the mainstay of manufacturing industry in most countries: a time of profitless prosperity. And as car companies go, so may go many others. They will have to cope both with a normal cyclical downturn in the market in most countries, and with the need to reinvent themselves. Expect more mergers to mop up excess capacity: the merger of Daimler and Chrysler has already triggered Renault's fusion with Nissan and Ford's purchase of Volvo. The ways in which cars are made, distributed and sold will also change. New forms of propulsion are being developed that might one day replace the internal combustion engine. And the vehicles themselves are becoming more complex, with more niche products, cars that no longer fit into simple categories. 
The long boom in America, which will see record sales of more than 17m cars and light trucks in 1999 (up from the previous 1986 record of 16.2m), is coming to an end. The huge market in minivans (an odd name for vehicles that look like bungalows on wheels), beloved by Americans, is weakening. Europe's record sales of 16m surprised the industry in 1999. Most companies think the market will fall in 2000, putting further pressure on their slim profit margins. In Japan there is no end to the stagnation that has hurt all the manufacturers. And Brazil is going from bad to worse, racking up losses for the global car companies that have piled billions into new factories there, in the hope of riding the surge in car sales that goes with rapid economic development. Tight credit and high interest rates have wrecked the car market as the government struggles to stabilise the economy after the crisis that began in 1998. 
Outside the special case of Brazil, the market problems are most acute in Europe. There is a basic 30% over-capacity in the European market. Features such as air conditioning, electronic brakes and suspension control are now becoming standard even in small, inexpensive cars, whereas ten years ago they were confined to executive models. European prices have been slipping by about 2.5% a year, enough to swallow improvements in productivity. 
Only DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen are making decent profits. General Motors and Ford are barely making money on their huge European sales. Fiat is actually losing money. All this will get worse in 2000. Growing consumer resistance to high prices in Britain (estimated to be about a fifth higher than continental markets) is spurring the European Commission to scrutinise ""block exemption"", the system that permits car makers to restrict sales to exclusive dealer networks, thus enabling them to keep prices high. When the exemption expires in 2002, it is unlikely to be renewed. So expect car prices in Europe to edge down, especially as the euro promotes transparency and makes for a regional single market. In Britain both Volkswagen and Ford, faced with customers waiting for prices to fall, have had to promise to reimburse customers for any cuts that take place after their purchase. 
The consolidation that started with DaimlerChrysler will continue in Europe and in Asia. General Motors gets ever closer to absorbing Daewoo, a bankrupt South Korean manufacturer. Fiat and Psn Peugeot Citroen are the two European companies most likely to be absorbed by bigger groups before the end of 2000. Car companies need to have sales of around 4m-5m a year to benefit from economies of scale. This is the strategy that has made Volkswagen so successful in recent years: it is now twice the size of Fiat or Peugeot. In a sense, being global does not matter in itself; it just happens to be the best way to reach the right size. 
As for the predators, both Ford and DaimlerChrysler are on the prowl again. Daimler will probably snap up Peugeot. Ford is renewing its interest in Fiat as a way out of losses in its medium and small cars in Europe. General Motors has been studying a proposal to buy a stake in Fiat's car division and pool its operations with GM Europe. Neither of these American giants can sustain the slim pickings they earn in the European market these days. 
After dithering about it for some time, car companies-especially in America-are waking up to the fact that the Internet will have a big impact on retailing. That is why they are rushing to shorten the order-to-delivery time as customers increasingly want to specify the options and colour from information on a website (after taking a virtual test drive) and then nip round to a local showroom to pick up the keys in a couple of weeks. If car companies can master this, each vehicle on an assembly line will be customised for the buyer; rather in the way Dell Computers does with personal computers. 
Another change comes from manufacturing: Audi is launching a new small car built on a sort of ""space frame"", which amounts to clipping together stressed lengths of aluminium, giving the car its strength, rather than relying on a body shell. The impact of this technology is to permit small production runs. 
Watch out for new types of vehicles in 2000 that are impossible to categorise. For example, Ford's biggest minivan, the Lincoln Navigator, is also a luxury vehicle; likewise the startling rT Cruiser that DaimlerChrysler launches in the spring can either be seen as one of those old ""woody"" American station wagons or as a roomy saloon car that converts into a multi-purpose vehicle. Toyota's revolutionary hybrid Prius model, already selling well in Japan and coming to America and Europe in the summer, is also a new type of vehicle. It runs off a battery electric motor in town to cut pollution and uses a small petrol engine on the open road or to charge the battery. Fewer fumes and fewer companies-the future of the car industry becomes a little less foggy in 2000. 
Iain Carson: industry editor, The Economist.  1999 What exactly do sexy technologies like Internet links and solar-energy panels have to do with petrol stations, the grimy watering holes of the Industrial Age? At face value, nothing. Yet you will see both technologies spread like wildfire across the retail petrol outlets of some of the world's biggest oil companies in 2000. The reasons behind this explain why Big Oil is in big trouble, and suggest an early, if still hazy, outline of the energy industry of the next century. 
The upheaval that traumatised the oil industry in 1999 will continue in 2000, though not for the reason that some suspect. Many have pointed to the roller-coaster ride that oil prices have taken of late, bouncing between $10 and $25 a barrel, as the reason for the merger frenzy that produced the marriages of Exxon with Mobil, Br with Amoco and Arco, and TotalFina with Elf. Yet the price of oil is less important than it seems. 
This is because two forces much more powerful than the fickle oil price are driving the restructuring: the rise of markets, and growing public alarm over global warming. These twin forces are already beginning to transform petroleum from the world's most strategic asset into just another commodity; in time, they may even make it yesterday's fuel. 
To see why, consider an experiment with the first of those two sexy technologies. In America, sr intends to offer some customers who pump their own petrol Internet information, such as weather, road conditions and area maps. The reason companies want to do this is to control costs. Such technology will make pumps so smart that they can re-order petrol as they are about to run out or e-mail for help as things go wrong. 
The pressure to cut costs in the oil industry will only increase as institutional shareholders clamour for better returns: oil shares have had the worst total returns on investor capital of any major industrial sector in the 1990s. It is precisely such pressure that is making the dinosaurs of Big Oil dance so nimbly. While no new colossus the size of Exxon Mobil can emerge, look for the consolidation to continue in 2000 among the mid-sized players like Chevron, Texaco and Eni. 
Get ready too for a fire sale. In addition to merging like mad, firms of all sizes will shed peripheral assets in a desire to convince investors that they will stick to their knitting. Others will sell assets under orders from anti-trust authorities. The big winners will be the nimble entrepreneurs and businesses who could become serious competitive threats to the oil majors. For example, look for firms such as PetroPlus in Europe to expand in refining (ar is one to watch for big disposals in that area), and expect Dow Chemical in America to gobble up speciality chemicals units (as Shell and TotalFina-Elf hive off petrochemicals). The few oil companies that still have some coal assets, such as Exxon Mobil, are also likely to dump these soon. 
Green Giants? Another factor that will transform the oil business in 2000 is growing concern over the environment. At one level, environmental concern is propelled by the Kyoto protocol on global warming, a treaty signed in 1997 that commits the developed economies to make cuts in carbon emissions. This treaty is not just un fluff: it might prove to be the death knell for those oil and coal producers that do not change their ways. 
Government negotiators are due to meet in late 2000 at a follow-up summit to Kyoto in order to hammer out details. It is likely that the Clinton administration, preoccupied with the presidential election in November and fearful of the anti-Kyoto Republican Senate, will push for a postponement of the gathering. But, even if America succeeds, public concern will ensure that global warming stays on the minds of oil bosses. 
That is why they will make big investments in 2000 in cleaner technologies. Natural gas, which is much cleaner than coal or oil, will attract the lion's share of investment. Demand for gas is forecast to grow twice as fast as that for oil over the next decade. A big spur to this dash for gas will be the progressive liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets in Europe and America in 2000. Indeed, the two markets are fast converging in America and in Britain; this will accelerate through ever freer international trading of power. This coming liberalisation will drive some oil companies, in particular Shell and Texaco, to build a bigger presence in power generation. One may even gobble up a big power company during 2000. Watch too for the more adventurous oil giants to venture into the thorny retail gas and electricity game. The European Commission has ordered Eu countries to allow their biggest electricity customers free choice of supplier. In 2000, gas markets will be thrown open. 
The Kyoto treaty is changing the rules of oil in a broader sense too. Markets are already beginning to accept that the aims of Kyoto, if not the terms of the treaty itself, are inevitable. The result has been a flurry of voluntary schemes by companies and national governments to reduce emissions and encourage carbon trading. The result could be that the aims of the Kyoto treaty may well be achieved by a more market-friendly means, than if the politicians forge ahead with a heavy-handed accord. 
Some energy companies will even begin investing heavily in renewable technologies like fuel cells. DaimlerChrysler, Ford and Toyota promise to bring zero-emission fuel-cell cars to market as soon as 2004. As fantasy fast approaches market reality, look for oil companies to invest in rival fuel infrastructure, ranging from methanol to hydrogen to ""clean"" petrol. Oil companies will also increase investments in forestry for biomass energy, and wind power. One scenario that Shell is contemplating is that half of the firm's revenues will come from renewable energy by 2050. 
If that sounds implausible, consider the curious sight of solar panels popping up on top of BP and Shell petrol stations. Why in the world are the biggest purveyors of petrol exposing exactly how filthy their fuel is by installing clean, green solar panels? The reason is that they have already figured out what the rest of Big Oil will begin to realise in 2000: that the rise of greenery, Kyoto or not, spells bad news for those who refuse to embrace cleaner technologies. Small wonder, then, that sr has become the world's biggest solar-power company. 
Vijay Vaitheeswaran: environment and energy correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Still in swaddling clothes at the start of the century, the telecoms industry now feels itself prepared to dominate our lives in the next. Yet 2000 will see the industry's confidence sorely tested. In particular, the telecoms industry's ability to buy its way out of trouble or into new markets is increasingly in doubt: this despite the fact that the stockmarket capitalisation of the industry worldwide is in excess of $1 trillion. 
The primary issue-half opportunity, half threat-is ""convergence"". The term refers to the elision between once-distinct telecoms technologies-the conventional fixed telephone and the newer mobile variety or the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the Internet. But it also applies to the industrial meshing of the telecoms sector with the worlds of IT, media and entertainment. 
The phrase most commonly used to describe the convergence process to date is ""a blurring of distinctions"" between technologies and industries. Those likely to prosper in 2000 will be those who are able to see things with pin-sharp clarity. 
On paper, the traditional telephone companies are well-placed to operate on all three fronts. Building on their traditional dominance of fixed telephony, they were among the pioneers of mobile services and were only slightly late in arriving on the Internet scene. For most old-style operators, the growth in mobile-telephone and Internet revenues has obscured the rapid decline in traditional telephone revenues, which followed the introduction of competition in developed markets in the second half of the 1990s. These companies were able to buy into the Internet and mobile-phone markets thanks only to the streams of profits from standard wired-phone networks. 
As these funds dry up or disappear, a question mark hangs over the ability of these companies to sustain their assaults on newer markets. Their war chests are not yet empty, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how they will replenish them the next time around. 
Events in 2000 will show the way. Far from attempting to create converged companies capable of satisfying custourer requirements in telephony, mobiles and the Internet as a ""one-stop shop"", many major players will seek to spin off their mobile and Internet arms as separate entities. This would enable these operating divisions to raise muchneeded investment capital and to prune costs to levels nearer the ""leaner and meaner"" upstarts they face. 
Although sound, this strategy raises two questions. First, what becomes of the ancient parent, left only with a dwindling share of a fixed telephony market whose profitability is in steady decline? Second, what if the world's tech-obsessed bourses lose their appetites for telecoms and Internet shares before separate subsidiaries can be floated? 
The second question concerns new and old carriers alike. Outside the United States, there are still billions of dollars to be released in government-held equity in the old national telephone companies. Added to this, 2000 will see repeated calls on the world's markets for cash-raising bonds, capital enlargements and loans. Much of the planned expansion in fields such as mobile phones and the Internet has been predicated on the ready access to such funding. 
These cash calls are not getting any lighter. Take mobile phones: the nextgeneration wireless networks are set to be licensed in 2000 in most big countries. Whether or not we witness a stampede for these so-called ""3G"" licences-for a technology supporting mobile access to voice, data, the Internet and video-will depend on whether would-be bidders believe capital will be available to build these new networks. 
This is an important point. Ahead of the commercial launch of 3G networks-- due in 2002-existing cellular networks will become more and more able to support the needs of an information-hungry population. Expect routine e-mail access and the ability of mobile users to ""surf' stripped-down versions of web pages from their handsets to gain prominence in 2000. Given the current growth in the cellular market-which should see a staggering 70% of the populations in the Nordic region owning a cellphone in 2000-there is a risk that 3G systems will be obsolete before they are off the ground. 
Jim Chalmers: editor, Public Network Europe.  1999 The gadget of choice for children of all ages-especially well-heeled ones in their 30s and up-is going to be Sony's new video-game machine. With a graphics engine capable of generating 75m polygons (the basic unit of 3D models) per second, PlayStation2 has five times the power of today's most powerful graphics workstations. But what makes PlayStation2 a natural winner is that it is not simply a videogame console. Apart from being able to play video games on discs with frighteningly realistic graphics and even download new games from the Internet, it can double as a DVD movie and CD audio player. Expect to see PlayStation2 being used as much for downloading and playing movies as for zapping aliens. When? The new Sony game machine hits the Japanese market on March 4th with a price tag of Y39,800 ($370). The rest of Asia will see it during the summer, while America and Europe will have to wait until the autumn. And fast on its heels will come the new Nintendo console, to be called Dolphin. 
The portable video phone will finally be coming to a shop near you. Kyocera has been selling its tiny VisualPhone VP-210 in Japan since May 1999. With its built-in video camera and screen, the portable phone allows a person to see who he or she is talking to, while being seen as well as heard in return. Kyocera's handset weighs a mere 165 grams and has a recommended price of 40,000. Orange, a. British cell-phone company, plans to go one better when it launches its as-yet unnamed wireless video phone-cum-pocket organiser this summer. Its touch-screen can recognise and transmit handwriting as well as let the user download e-mail and surf the Internet. The pocket-sized gizmo can send and receive video phone calls as well. 
The most politically correct form of private transport is going to be the hybrid car. Since launching its little Prius model in December 1997, Toyota has surprised everyone (including itself by selling 30,000 of these part-petrol, part-electric cars that get nearly 80 miles to the metric gallon. Honda has now gone one better with a hybrid called Insight that does 100 miles per gallon-and will soon be coming down your road soon. 
Pocket-sized digital cameras have been around since Casio shook the photographic world with its nifty little QV10 five years ago. But it had only 350,000 pixels (picture elements) per frame against photographic film's millions. Now Japan's digital camera makers are introducing ""mega-pixel"" models. These produce images with a lifelike 2m-3m pixels. Canon's PowerShot SlO costs Y89,900. 
Nicholas Valery: Tokyo bureau chief, 
The Economist.  1999 Chief executives of America's top 200 companies will take home 400 times the wage of the average factory worker, if share options hold up. 
More and more large corporations will get into the venture-capital business in the years ahead. Is this an oxymoron? Can an established company take the risks and spare the management to invest in start-ups? Unequivocally the answer is yes. In an era when many large firms are questioning the productivity of their investments in traditional R&D laboratories, venture organisations represent an intriguing alternative. 
Much of this interest is being stimulated by the recent success of independent venture-capitalism: for example, the rapid growth of capital under management and the spectacular returns of many funds in recent years. Although total disbursements from the venture industry over the past two decades have been far less than the R&D spending of either isNt or General Motors, the economic successes of venture-backed firms-such as Intel, Microsoft, Yahoo, Genentech and Cisco Systems-have been profound. As a result, several hundred corporate-venture programmes have been established over the past three years to invest in entrepreneurial ventures, whether in spin-outs of internal concerns or in entities outside the firm. Although American and Japanese corporations have taken the lead, European companies-including France Telecom, Reuters and Siemens-are becoming increasingly active as well. 
In the excitement about the current surge of corporate venture-capital activity, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that similar programmes have existed in the past. The first corporate funds began in the mid-1960s. These corporate efforts were spurred by the successes of the first private venture-capital funds, which had backed such firms as Digital Equipment, Memorex, Raychem and Scientific Data Systems. Intrigued by this success, large companies began establishing divisions that emulated venture capitalists. But in 1973, the market for new public offerings-the primary avenue through which venture capitalists exit successful investments-abruptly declined. 
A relaxation of the rules allowing pension funds to invest and an increase in the number and strength of independent venture capitalists attracted big corporations back into the business in the 1980s. By 1986 corporate funds managed $2 billion, or nearly 12% of the total pool of venture capital. After the stockmarket crash of 1987, however, corporations scaled back: by 1992 the number of corporate venture programmes had fallen by one-third and their capital represented only 51 of the venture pool. 
These patterns have led many to conclude that corporate venture-capital is inherently unstable, and unlikely to be successful. In order to test this criticism, we examined over 30,000 investments in entrepreneurial firms by venture-capital organisations in the VentureOne database of private equity financings. Far from being outright failures, corporateventure investments in entrepreneurial firms appear to be at least as successful (using such measures as the probability of a portfolio firm going public) as those backed by independent venture organisations. 
But success is not uniform. The success of the corporate programmes is particularly pronounced for investments in which there is strategic overlap between the corporate parent and the portfolio firm. The success of investments when there is no overlap is much lower. Similar patterns emerge when the duration of the corporate programmes themselves is examined: the empirical evidence suggests that corporate programmes without a strategic focus are less stable than those of independent funds. The programmes frequently cease operations after only a few investments. Corporations with a strong strategic focus are almost as stable as independent funds. These insights are corroborated by field-based research. Corporate-venture managers can select higher quality firms in related industries, and then more effectively add value to these firms afterwards. This is more difficult when the portfolio company is in an industry far removed from that of the parent corporation. 
Why did corporations invest in areas that they did not know well in the first place? The diffuse nature of unsuccessful programmes appears to have reflected internal dissension about the programmes' goals. In many cases, important segments of the corporation, such as the legal department or R&D personnel, were uncomfortable with the programme and sought to restrict it to investing in areas where the corporation had few competing operations. In other instances, senior executives had inflated expectations about how rapidly widely dispersed investments could affect corporate profitability. 
Corporations will come under growing pressure to rethink their innovation plans. The enormous surge in venture-financing, the success of these firms in creating market value, will make corporate venture-capital programmes part of the tool kit for major corporations around the world.  1999 The need for management development has never been more pressing. The world is awash with money but short on the talent needed to meet the combined challenges of globalisation, new technologies and an increasingly entrepreneurial culture. If capitalism is to be democratised through more and more small and medium enterprises, the engines of employment growth, then we can no longer afford good-quality management education to be accessible only to a privileged few. This is a matter of national competitiveness. 
But to serve the boardroom of the multinational, management education must also change. The profile of the successful corporate leader grows ever more complex. The ideal chief executive in 2000 has to be global in perspective yet willing to sweat over the details. He or she must be entrepreneurial yet also be a team player; able to articulate a vision, yet flexible enough to change the strategy whenever necessary. 
Can the businessschool industry, invented in the United States around 100 years ago, foster such new and diverse talents? The robust new insights to guide and frame management practice still flow primarily from academics at the leading schools. But corporate leaders in future will be more likely to cherrypick the ideas of individual academic gurus than adopt the overall intellectual leadership of a particular academic brand. In addition, many good ideas are flowing from the very consultants whom the top business schools trained. Independent-minded academics are not always as inclined as consultants to team up and tackle the really big problems. 
A second strength of business schools is that fast-growing knowledge businesses, including consulting firms, investment banks and high-tech companies, remain heavy recruiters of MBAs. The business schools have done the screening for them. But, increasingly, industrial firms are being priced out of the MBA market at the top schools. In future more companies will turn to talented BA graduates and put them through in-house training programmes. At Motorola, British Aerospace and many other leading multinationals, training can lead to MBA degrees in their own corporate universities. This is the fastest-growing segment of the management development market. 
To retain their premium status, the top business schools will have to attract top faculty talent. A continuous flow of new ideas and a community that fosters creativity are the lifeblood of any academic institution. As in any other industry, business schools need a clear positioning in the marketplace. 
Most business schools do not develop important new ideas but, acting as metoo competitors, repackage the ideas of others at lower prices. Most are in fact training and thinly veiled consulting organisations. The barriers to entry are minimal; a warm body and a chalkboard and you have a business school. There are well over 100 MBA programmes in the United Kingdom and the accreditation process to provide some modest quality control cannot keep pace. However, the demand for management education is burgeoning and, although some of the MBAs granted may not be worth much, not everyone can go to one of the top schools. 
Internet delivery of management training promises to expand the market further. The virtual University of Phoenix has more MBAs enrolled than any other university in the United States. For basic skills training in subjects such as accounting, finance and quantitative methods, distance learning may be feasible. 
But for those softer skills in human resources management, leadership and team-building, face-to-face interaction among students and faculty will remain essential to the learning process. 
The top business schools will use Internet delivery and study groups connected by email to supplement on-site coursework in their part-time or executive MBA programmes. However, there will always be a market for the full-time MBA among bright twenty-somethings who want to take time out to take stock of their career path, brush up on the latest thinking, perhaps develop a business plan for a start-up, and become a member of a global alumni network. But, if Internetdelivered management education develops further, will the quality gap close to the point that the higher prices charged by the traditional business schools are no longer sustainable? 
Recalling the famous case-study on Japanese Honda's entry into the United States motorcycle market, the relative indifference of the top business schools to the virtual MBA is reminiscent of HarleyDavidson's unfortunate smugness. Could the virtual University of Phoenix be today's academic equivalent of the Honda motorcycle of 1965?

For today's bosses there is nothing more shaming than appearing not ""to get"" the Internet. When Oracle's Larry Ellison proclaims that ""the Internet changes everything"" or Intel's Andy Grove warns that in five years' time ""all companies will be Internet companies or they won't be companies at all"", few dare to disagree. But what is it that they are agreeing with? What kind of industrial revolution are they suddenly so desperate to embrace? 
Between 1995 and 1997, when the World Wide Web began emerging as a mass market platform, interest in the Internet as a business opportunity was focused on its potential as a marketing tool and an additional, low-cost distribution channel. Pioneers, such as Dell Computer, also showed that for some companies it could offer a more direct way of reaching customers, cutting out middlemen and resellers who didn't add much value. But if that was interesting for many (and alarming for a few), it was not yet truly compelling. While most media attention was on the glamorous consumer side of the web-content and shopping-and on the gravity-defying share prices of upstart Internet firms such as Amazon.com and Yahoo!, serious, grown-up businesses appeared to be biding their time. 
But no longer. The Internet is beginning to turn mainstream business upside down and inside out. It is fundamentally changing the way many companies operate, most obviously in high-tech, but even in metal-bashing industries. And web-based transactions-buying and selling over the Internet-are only the tip of a massive and expanding iceberg. While some companies are indeed using the Internet to deal directly with their customers for the first time, others are using the Internet's reach and ubiquity to intensify relationships with trading partners, request quotes or liquidate surplus inventory by auction. 
The Internet is making it possible for companies to lower costs dramatically across their supply-and-demand chains, take customer service to undreamed-of new levels, enter markets from which they were previously excluded by geography, create new revenue streams and ultimately redefine the very nature of their business. Entirely new companies are appearing in industries ranging from advertising to road haulage to chemicals. Using the connectivity of the Internet, these ""infomediaries"" create super-efficient electronic marketplaces, bringing together buyers and sellers who previously could not find each other. 
Although limelight-hogging consumer e-commerce is growing fast, it is as nothing compared with both the speed and the absolute amount of intercompany trade in goods over the Internet. Forrester Research, a technology consultancy, reckons that whereas business-to-consumer e-commerce in America (still the most ""wired"" country by some way) will go from $8 billion last year to $108 billion in 2003, business-tobusiness e-commerce will surge from $43 billion to $1.3 trillion in the same period. Forrester expects Britain and Germany to go into the same ""hypergrowth"" stage of e-business about two years after America, with Japan, Italy and France a further two years behind. 
And just as countries are moving towards e-business hyper-growth at slightly different paces, so too are industries. Unsurprisingly, computing and electronics adopted and evangelised the Internet first and are therefore already well on the way to achieving critical mass. But aerospace, telecoms and the car industry are also undergoing massive Internetdriven change and are not far behind. The same is true of other industries, such as financial services, that have appropriate systems-integration skills and have invested heavily in the right kind of iT infrastructure. 
While nimble Internet start-ups are a ceaseless source of business model innovation and have been responsible for giving established giants a nerve-jangling wake-up call (one that rang worryingly late in some boardrooms), it is big companies with real financial and market heft that are now providing the main traction for e-business. Lou Gerstner, the head of IBm, likes to describe the new ""dot.com"" firms as ""fireflies before the storm-all stirred up, throwing off sparks."" According to Mr Gerstner, the storm that is now arriving is ""when the thousands and thousands of institutions that exist today seize the power of this global computing and communications infrastructure and use it to transform themselves. That's the real revolution."" 
Mr Gerstner may have a prejudice in favour of big companies. After all, he runs one of the biggest in the world. But he is right. When a Ford, a Wal-Mart, a BancOne or General Electric (GE) turns itself into an e-business, it is an event that reverberates. Traditionally, IT investments have been inward-looking, concentrated on making each enterprise more efficient in isolation. By contrast, the Internet is all about communicating, connecting and transacting with the outside world. With e-business, the benefits should come not just from speeding up and automating one's own internal processes, but from extending those efficiency gains to suppliers and customers. 
When a really large company, at considerable cost in terms of both money and upheaval, moves some or all of its operations to the web, it puts its trading partners under intense pressure to do the same. Suppliers, and even some customers, who insist on continuing to trade the old-fashioned way will get frozen out, while those that make the effort will win more of the available business. 
And that effort involves more than just iT spending: it is cultural too. No longer can any business see itself as a more or less free-standing entity. It must become part of an e-business ecosystem in which firms that trade with each other use the Internet to allow their partners and customers to enter deep into their internal systems and processes. To reap the rewards of a truly integrated value chain requires a degree of openness and flexibility that comes naturally to few firms. As an executive at Cisco Systems, the dominant supplier of networking gear that many regard as the ultimate ebusiness, puts it, ""You have to be ready to open the kimono."" 
That in turn may mean radically reappraising what your company does or even is. Jack Welch has put ""dyb.com""destroyyourbusiness-teams into every one of GE's operating units to force the Internet revolution through the huge firm. Ford is giving serious consideration to outsourcing all its manufacturing, stripping the company down to its essentials of product development, brand management and customer service. Others will follow. software as a service to be paid for. Another booming sector will be industry portals and hubs. For more than a decade, multinationals have been investing billions of dollars in complex systems designed to automate their internal inventory, sales and supply-chain operations. The hardest part has been bringing their business partners-suppliers, customers, service providersinto the loop: the cacophony of different technologies and data formats is too much for most to bear. The Internet has become the great mediator: the largest single barrier-connectivity-disappears; hubs will emerge in industry clusters to provide a lingua franca for sharing data, from product and price lists to shipping information. 
The aim of this is not so much to help companies sell more goods, but to lower the cost of doing so. This will change the economic shape of the industry. From a race between speedy start-ups to capture new consumer markets, it will become a battle of titans as large, established firms in everything from manufacturing to accounting try to use the Internet to gain advantage over their competitors. The new companies that arise will be those that help companies do this best, whether by providing software, services or a marketplace. A slowing stockmarket will leave scars, but the amount of money available for Internet ventures will remain huge: this is an industrial revolution, not a tulip bubble, and good investors always knew that supernormal capitalisations could not last. 
The other technology trends of the year will all stem from the Internet. Mobile phones using the Wireless Application Protocol will hit the streets of Europe, Asia and America, bringing web access, e-mail, even banking to pocket-sized devices. This is the first big step towards the emergence of handheld devices, from personal digital assistants to smart phones, as a rival to the rc for the Internet throne. Sony's PlayStation2 will mark the rise of the consumer-electronics industry as the rc's other competitor. While the rc will improve and become more popular, this is no longer a one-box game. 2000 will be the year when the seeds of something bigger begin to sprout.

Matthew Symonds: IT and communications editor, The Economist.  1999 Peter Drucker, the grand old man of management science, predicts an unlikely twist that e-commerce will give to every business. 
Traditional multinationals will, in time, be killed by e-commerce. The ecommerce delivery of goods, of services, of repairs, spare parts and maintenance, will require a different organisation from that of any multinational today. It will also require a different mindset, a different top management and, in the end, different definitions of performance. Indeed, the very way performance is measured will change. 
In most businesses today delivery is considered a ""support"" function, a routine to be taken care of by clerks. It is taken for granted unless something goes 
dramatically wrong. But under e-commerce delivery will become the one area in which a business can truly distinguish itself. It will become the critical ""core competence"". Its speed, quality and responsiveness may well become the decisive competitive factor even where brands seem to be entrenched. And there is no existing multinational and altogether very few businesses which are organised for it. Very few yet even think that way. 
The railway, invented in 1829, mastered distance. This explains why, more than any other of the inventions of the industrial revolution, the railway changed every nation's economy and workforce. It changed humanity's mindset, its horizon, its ""mental geography"". 
E-commerce does not merely master distance, it eliminates it. There is no reason why, under e-commerce, the vendor has to be in any particular place. In fact, the customer as a rule does not know and does not care where the ecommerce vendor is located. And the ecommerce vendor in turn, for example Amazon.com, today the world's biggest book seller, neither knows nor cares where the purchase order comes from. 
If the purchase is itself electronic information-a software program or a trade on a stockmarket-there is no delivery problem. The ""product"" itself is, after all, only an entry in a computer memory. It has a legal but no physical existence. (There is, however, a considerable tax problem with this type of trade in electronically delivered goods, which will give the world's tax authorities a headache in 2000. The intelligent ones will drop such taxes, the unintelligent ones will devise nonsense rules of control.) 
If the purchase is a book, there is still not much of a delivery problem. Books ship easily, have high value-toweight ratios and pass without much trouble across national boundaries and through customs. But a tractor has to be delivered to where the customer is and it can neither be delivered electronically nor by parcel post. 
Delivery also seems to be needed for newspapers and magazines, that is, for the carriers of printed information. At least, none of the attempts made so far to sell an ""on-line"" edition to be read on the subscriber's computer or ""downloaded"" from it, has been a great success. Subscribers want their paper delivered to the doorstep. 
Medical diagnosis and test results are increasingly being put on the Internet. But practically everything to do with sickness care-from the physician's examination to surgery, medication and physical rehabilitation-has to be delivered where the patient is. And so does all after-purchase service, whether it is servicing a physical product, for example, a machine or a bicycle, or something as non-physical as a bank loan. 
Cars by e-mail 
But at the same time any business, and indeed any institution, that can organise delivery can operate in any market anywhere, without having any physical presence there. 
One example: one of the fastestgrowing businesses in the United States today is an e-mail seller of new passenger automobiles: CarsDirect.com. Based in a Los Angeles suburb, it was founded as recently as January 1999. CarsDirect.com became in July 1999 one of the 20 largest car dealers in the country, operating in 40 of the 50 states of the Union, and selling 1,000 vehicles a month. It does not owe its success to cheaper prices or to particular prowess in selling cars; in fact in these areas it still lags well behind such older and bigger e-commerce automobile dealers as Autobytel.com or CarPoint.com, a Microsoft subsidiary. But CarsDirect, unlike its competitors, has organised a unique delivery system. It has signed up 1,100 traditional dealers throughout the country to deliver CarsDirect's sales to the local purchaser, with a guaranteed delivery date and with quality-controlled service. 
Delivery is equally important-it may indeed be more important-in e-commerce between businesses. And by all indications e-commerce between businesses is growing even faster than e-retail commerce and is becoming transnational even faster. 
But e-commerce separates, for the first time in business history, selling and purchase. Selling is completed when the order has been received and paid for. Purchasing is completed only when the purchase has been delivered and actually not until it satisfies the purchaser's want. And whereas ecommerce demands centralisation, delivery has to be totally decentralised. It needs ultimately to be local, detailed and accurate. 
Just as e-commerce separates selling and purchasing, it separates making and selling. Under e-commerce, what we now know as ""production"" becomes procurement. There is absolutely no reason at all why any e-commerce facility should limit itself to marketing and selling one maker's products or brands. 
In fact, as both Amazon.com and CarsDirect.com show, the great strength of e-commerce is precisely that it provides the customer with a whole range of products, no matter who makes them. But in traditional business structures, selling is still seen and organised as a servant to production, or as the cost centre that ""sells what we make"". In the future e-commerce companies will ""sell what we can deliver"".  1999 By February the Y2K bug will already be fading into memory, having left a lot less damage than many had feared, but having cost a lot more to eliminate than anyone predicted. Companies that had frozen new IT projects for most of 1999 will now be free to invest in the future, not the past. And for them the future is business-to-business e-commerce. This e-business boom will shift the centre of gravity of the Internet industry towards, well, more gravity. Whereas the Internet stock boom of early 1999 was fuelled by fun consumer companies-Amazon, Yahoo!, AOL-many of the rags-to-riches stories of 2000 will be cast from far more serious stuff: industrial trading communities, web-based outsourcing services, business software providers. Although a new crop of e-business darlings will capture the headlines, most of the real ""start-ups"" will not be new companies, but entrepreneurial efforts within big companies, helping each to shift internally in time with the outside revolution. The best firms will find clever ways to encourage this, by creating in-house incubators, corporate venture-capital funds, even stock-option programmes linked to e-business results. 
Why this shift from consumers to companies? Because that is where the infrastructure is, to say nothing of the money. Assume a ""web lifestyle""-having near-constant access to computers with high-speed Internet connectionsand suddenly all sorts of services, from television to finance, naturally move to the web, where they are cheaper, faster, more efficient and far more flexible than the systems they replace. No big population is closer to a web lifestyle than America's office workers, who are sitting on a decade's investment in rcs, software and corporate networks that has never quite paid the dividends promised. The Internet brings it all together, triggering a second wave of corporate automation and the emergence of a host of business-to-business e-commerce companies and services. 
""Application hosting""-paying outside companies to run your huge databases and supply-chain software-will be one such booming e-business market. Its boosters may pitch it as ""free"" software, but in reality it is the shift from software as a product to be bought to software as a service to be paid for. Another booming sector will be industry portals and hubs. For more than a decade, multinationals have been investing billions of dollars in complex systems designed to automate their internal inventory, sales and supply-chain operations. The hardest part has been bringing their business partners-suppliers, customers, service providersinto the loop: the cacophony of different technologies and data formats is too much for most to bear. The Internet has become the great mediator: the largest single barrier-connectivity-disappears; hubs will emerge in industry clusters to provide a lingua franca for sharing data, from product and price lists to shipping information. 
The aim of this is not so much to help companies sell more goods, but to lower the cost of doing so. This will change the economic shape of the industry. From a race between speedy start-ups to capture new consumer markets, it will become a battle of titans as large, established firms in everything from manufacturing to accounting try to use the Internet to gain advantage over their competitors. The new companies that arise will be those that help companies do this best, whether by providing software, services or a marketplace. A slowing stockmarket will leave scars, but the amount of money available for Internet ventures will remain huge: this is an industrial revolution, not a tulip bubble, and good investors always knew that supernormal capitalisations could not last. 
The other technology trends of the year will all stem from the Internet. Mobile phones using the Wireless Application Protocol will hit the streets of Europe, Asia and America, bringing web access, e-mail, even banking to pocket-sized devices. This is the first big step towards the emergence of handheld devices, from personal digital assistants to smart phones, as a rival to the rc for the Internet throne. Sony's PlayStation2 will mark the rise of the consumer-electronics industry as the rc's other competitor. While the rc will improve and become more popular, this is no longer a one-box game. 2000 will be the year when the seeds of something bigger begin to sprout. 
Chris Anderson: Asia business correspondent, The Economist.  1999 The future of advertising? Seemingly, an enviable one. For the past five years, growth rates have consistently outpaced the general growth of SDP in all developed economies. And forecasters predict another decade of expansion, at an average of 8% annually. This is more than respectable for a business that saw global advertising expenditures top out last year at over $400 billion. 
Yet the compelling issues surrounding marketing and communications do not concern the size or long-term viability of our industry. The key questions grow out of the fact that mass marketing, though still the mainstay of our business, will be on the wane. Our future will involve direct interactions linking producers of goods and services to their customers. This is being mandated by digital technology and the Internet, which are driving the convergence of every form of media. And-in our almost overwhelmingly complex landscape of consumer choice and technological changethere will be an increasingly prominent role for brands and for communications initiatives with measurable results. 
So much for the short answers. To understand and unravel their implications, however, it becomes necessary to take a broader look at major developments in the recent history of consumer marketing. 
For some years now, technological innovation has been shifting the balance of power in all areas of marketing. By leading the way in the capture and manipulation of consumer data, retailers wrested a great deal of marketing clout from manufacturers. This, in turn, gave retailers a major influence on a product's success or failure, as well as an important voice in shaping new product development. 
More significant still were the shifts which empowered consumers. Overcapacity has become the rule in industry after industry, creating a glut of goods in most every product category. An increasingly outdated approach to brand management has leaned too heavily on incremental marketing strategies, such as an over-reliance on online extensions and rudimentary demographic targeting. True product differentiation-the critical ingredient of brand building-has become increasingly rare. As if those challenges were not enough, the proliferation of media has created hundreds of channels through which to reach consumers, all but sealing the fate of mass marketing. 
And yet, these changes pale in comparison to the online tsunami we are just beginning to experience. The size of today's Internet economy has been estimated at over $500 billion, and growing fast. Analysts in our business expect American online advertising revenue to grow from under $3 billion this year to more than $30 billion in five years. That is a conservative estimate, because new media, once they pick up steam, tend towards explosive growth. In 1950, Procter & Gamble spent less than 5% of its advertising dollars on a new medium called television; five years later, it was committing 80% of its budget to television. 
But the Internet is more than a medium in the traditional sense. For the first time ever, message delivery has been linked to distribution, as well as to a consumer who can make purchase decisions-at the click of a mouse. 
This explains why consumers are flocking to the web in greater numbers than anyone expected. Online purchases are accelerating, particularly in the business-to-business area. As a result, marketers are being forced to shift their priorities and come to grips with this new reality. It's not hard to see why the opportunities, and the potential pitfalls, of e-commerce are immense. 
From our point of view, what distinguishes the Internet are a number of unique and sustainable attributes. It is available whenever and wherever you want it. It is incredibly affordable. And it is interactive, That is a combination that cannot be found anywhere else in the marketing universe-which is why the Internet will fundamentally change how companies take their products and services to market in the 21st century. 
The web's combination of attributes also gives consumers unprecedented access to information, as well as leverage in shopping for price and demanding specifically customised products and services. Everyone seems to agree, for once and forever more, the customer is king. 
But the provider is also gaining an important new foothold with the customer. Because in the online world, sellers can identify individual consumers and amass considerable data regarding each and every one of them. Soon, the web will also provide even more sophisticated tools with which to discern and analyse a person's purchase patterns and behaviour. 
Those are the areas in which marketing communications will have the most to offer. As the customer perspective increasingly becomes the key driver of a company's overall business strategy, the role of marketing professionals will become more significant. After all, our key talent is in understanding and motivating consumer purchasing behaviour. We are best equipped to build relevant differentiation for brands. And people will increasingly rely on brands as qualifiers and guarantors in a world in which there is too much information and not enough time. 
Clients, also faced with an increasingly complex marketing environment and tremendous constraints on their resources, will look to us as the conductors of their marketing symphonies-choosing the optimal mix from among the persuasive disciplines, for dozens of product lines, in scores of geographies. 
So, while we still need to draw on advertising, direct marketing, public relations and design, the new campaigns we create will increasingly have to incorporate two important new online components: database marketing services and e-commerce solutions. The Internet makes knowing your customer more important than ever. 
Tom Bell, president of Young & Rubicam, sees the advertising Indus try changing beyond recognition.  1999 The first year of the new millennium will set a new and more cautious tone in financial markets-even if it starts with a Y2K bump. The party of the 1990s had been a wonderful one for most markets: in the developed world Japanese equities were the only serious casualty of the decade. But by the final months of 1999 there was already an awareness that no party lasts for ever and that at some stage it would be time to step out into the night and head for home. 
Looked at globally the great monetary achievement of the 1990s had been the conquest of inflation, the scourge of the second half of the 20th century. Markets celebrated that. They also tried to find a way of celebrating-or at least coming to terms with-the burst of innovation in communications of the past five years. Yes, the new technologies will change the performance of the world economy, lifting it a notch or two, just as other bursts of technical advance have done in the past. But how do you price such innovation? And finally the 1990s saw the world economy become steadily more global, a shift in which markets themselves played a crucial part, but which sometimes brought uncomfortable surprises when one bit of the world did not play by the global rules. 
So 2000 will set the markets three tasks. The first will be to judge the broad levels of inflation that will rule during the first part of the century. Are we talking about the present range of central-bank targets of 0-2.5%? Or will inflation reach the 3-5% region? Or will global prices decline? The second task is to price innovation. Financial markets have a lot of experience of coping with technical change, but have found it tough to price the Internet-related technologies: the volatility of prices during 1998 and 1999 represents a market failure. Markets need to do better in 2000. And the third task, most obviously for the currency markets, will be to figure out how global the world really has become. One obvious question is, ""Do current accounts still matter?"" At the beginning of 1999 they thought they didn't; by the end of the year they had reconsidered that view, particularly with regard to the dollar. 
Expect then for 2000 to see markets the world over stumble towards the view that global deflation in the next half century is as likely as global inflation. Sure, there will be peaks and troughs, and the short-term concern about rising inflation will push up short-term interest rates: first for the dollar, then the euro and by the end of 2000, the yen. But global bond yields need not rise and by the end of 2000 the long-term downward trend in yields should be evident again. 
Falling bond yields will underpin equities, which may well have a rough first half of the year. Bear markets happen, bubbles burst, and American equities in particular spent much of 1999 at stretched valuations. The key to ensuring that a bear market does not damage the real economy is to give share prices an anchor. The obvious anchor will be the prospect of continued price stability. So provided the central banks retain the confidence of the markets, share prices will put in an adequate performance. If they fail, expect a difficult year for all major equity markets. 
As for the second test, expect by the end of 2000 markets to be able to price high-technology stocks with much more confidence. The shake-out will render some of the go-go valuations of mid1999 absurd, but the markets will also realise that the new technologies will lift the productivity of the entire business sector. As markets appreciate that profits will come more from clever application than from cutting-edge development, they will begin to look for the substance rather than the hype. So expect a more mature approach to valuing technology: investors will start to look for profits rather than growth. Maybe they will not demand jam today, but they will want jam tomorrow, rather than jam at some indeterminate date in the future. 
Third, assessing global pressures on currencies: in the dim and distant past (like ten years ago) markets thought a current-account deficit was a sign of economic weakness. Recently they came to see it almost as a sign of strength-a current-account deficit equals strong growth and a capital inflow, which in turn indicates confidence both at home and abroad in the economy. If markets are now becoming more cautious they will want to see deficits start to be corrected, and if the United States does not pull back its current-account deficit, expect the dollar to be hit. If that happens, the other ""Anglo"" currencies, including sterling, will be hit with it. The euro, after its sickly birth, will become a healthier but more troublesome two-year-old. It will be healthier because the European recovery will appear more secure. It will be troublesome because the ""one-size-fitsall"" interest rate will mean that twothirds of Europe has the wrong rate. Tensions between the slower growing core and the fizzing fringe will grow. Elsewhere, expect the yen to have unexpected stability and the gradual recovery of confidence in most emerging markets to continue. 
So 2000 will be a more thoughtful, more mature year in the financial markets than 1999 turned out to be. Expect bond yields globally to end the year lower than they were at the beginning; expect share prices to be steady and recovering, whatever happens in the meantime. Expect technology companies to be rated by a cool assessment as to how soon they are going to be profitable rather than how big they might become. And expect currency stability if, and only if, current-account imbalances start to shrink. As for the wild card of Y2K-the great news will be that by the end of 2000 it will have become a distant memory. But so too will the 1990s party: welcome to a more sober decade. 
Hamish McRae: author of ""The World in 2020"" and associate editor of The Independent.  1999 In most countries central banks now have more power and independence than ever before. Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal Reserve, is probably the most revered central banker in world history. However, as a result of some serious monetary policy mistakes, central banks will face an uncomfortable year in 2000; some are likely to come under fierce political attack. Their prominence will start to decline. 
Central banking as we know it today is in fact a relatively recent invention. At the start of this century there were only 18 central banks; today there are 173. (When economies were on the gold standard or a dollar standard, they did not need a central bank to set interest rates.) Not only have they increased in number, but central banks have also gained independence from governments. Ten years ago, most central banks (the Fed and the Bundesbank being two main exceptions) were still firmly under the thumb of finance ministers, who told them when to change interest rates. But shortsighted politicians were often tempted to engineer a pre-election boom, which pushed up inflation. So today most central banks have been given independence and full control of the monetary reins. The new European Central Bank (ECa) has been set up as the most independent and powerful central bank in the world. Even the Bank of Japan, which has been widely blamed for Japan's prolonged slump after the bursting of its bubble, now has independence in setting interest rates. 
As well as power, many central banks have also won increased respect. This is partly due to their success in crushing inflation-now at its lowest level for almost half a century in the rich economies. But it is also partly thanks to the stunning success of Mr Greenspan in steering the American economy through almost nine years of uninterrupted, low inflationary growth-the longest peacetime expansion in American history. Mr Greenspan is worshipped almost like a god by investors who believe that he has eliminated the business cycle and so ensured ever-rising share prices. 
What might go wrong? Financial markets and the general public have excessive faith in what central banks can achieve. Their ability to steer economies with precision is much more limited than commonly realised. The immediate danger is not that inflation will return to its double-digit levels of the 1970s, for central bankers will be quick to raise interest rates if consumer prices accelerate. Instead there are new hazards to which central bankers, brought up on the idea that their sole job was to defeat inflation, have not yet woken up. Their new enemies are asset-price inflation and deflation. 
Judged by the test of low inflation, both the Fed and the Bank of Japan might be seen to have done a good job. But look closer and America's economy shows alarming signs of excess. By most standard measures, share prices look overvalued; firms and households have been on a borrowing binge; the broad M3 measure of money has been growing at its fastest rate in real terms for a quarter century; and the current-account deficit is nearing record levels. These are all classic symptoms of a bubble. The Fed has made a big mistake in ignoring share prices and these other imbalances. For history suggests that rapid increases in the prices of assets, such as shares or property, can be just as dangerous as consumer-price inflation. 
This does not mean that central banks should abandon the long-term goal of price stability, or try to target share prices. However, they should remember that price stability is not an end in itself, but only a means to the real objective of steady growth. In 2000-as America's bubble goes ""pop""-central banks will come to accept that they must widen their vision to take account of other signs of excess in setting monetary policy, such as asset prices, excessive growth in money and credit, and widening external deficits. 
The Bank of Japan's error lies at the other extreme. It has failed to realise that deflation can be even more dangerous than inflation. Since Japan's bubble of the late 1980s burst, the bank has consistently ignored the economic lessons of the 1930s and been too slow to ease monetary policy to support the economy. Although output has started to recover, Japan still shows many signs of deflation. Prices and wages are declining and output remains well below productive capacity. It is true that Japanese interest rates are close to zero, but when prices are falling, that still leaves real rates painfully high. The recent surge in the yen, which threatens to choke off Japan's fragile recovery and to worsen deflationary pressures, confirms that monetary policy is too tight. Even if the bank cannot push interest rates any lower, it can still push down the yen by, in effect, printing money. Yet the Bank of Japan has stubbornly refused to ease policy to halt the yen's rise. Its official reason is that it believes that policy is loose enough. What really holds it back, however, is that it wants to preserve its newly won independence and is therefore loth to cave in to politicians calling for monetary easing-even if they may be right. 
It may be too late for both the Fed and the Bank of Japan to escape blame. If America's stockmarket bubble bursts painfully, fickle investors, consumers and businessmen will quickly see Mr Greenspan in a rather less favourable light. Expect Congress to try to curb the Fed's powers. If the Bank of Japan continues stubbornly to refuse to ease monetary policy and thereby chokes the economy's nascent recovery, it too will face a political backlash. The problem with increased power is that you get all the blame when things go wrong. 
expected the share behaving ethically to double, to 47%. 
Such changes are thanks partly to investors. Those who want an easy conscience have plenty of choice. A survey of ""ethical"" investment in America, by Wiesenberger, a firm that tracks mutual funds, includes no fewer than 183 such funds in equities and bonds, domestic and foreign equities, small-cap and midcap, you name it. But will the investors see a decent return? The idea that virtue can be consistently more profitable than vice sounds too good to be true. Yet there is some evidence to support the claim. The Wiesenberger study, for example, found that what it calls ""socially screened funds"" had, on average, done consistently better than other funds (although they tended to be more risky and slightly more expensive). 
In the autumn of 1999 Dow Jones published a new index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (nasi), which it had drawn up with Sustainability Group, a Swiss firm that specialises in ethical financial services. ""Sustainability"" is defined according to a range of criteria measuring a firm's performance in economic, environmental and social terms. The index is composed of 229 firms, with a market value of $4.3 trillion, that are the 10% most sustainable companies in 68 industries across the world. 
At first sight, the strikingly good financial performance of the index is evidence that the ethical crowd are on to something. The companies in the index, which includes names such as Honeywell, Unilever, Skandia and Fujitsu, had on average produced higher shareholder returns over five years than other firms in their part of the world; on the whole, they also did better than the rest of their particular industry. 
Yet if lousy firms conclude that they can solve their problems simply by being nicer to their workers, they may be in for a shock. Which comes first, sustainability, profits or good management? Remember the old maxim that a clean factory is an efficient factory. Able managers tend to avoid waste, prevent accidents and motivate their staff, whether they are setting out to be sustainable or not. Few of the firms contained in the n,rsi satisfy the enthusiasts' call for a ""triple bottom line"" that would elevate social and environmental reporting to the status of financial reporting. 
Arguably, business ethics is as much about protection as opportunism. After damaging scandals, firms such as Nike and Mattel have felt obliged to pay closer attention to, say, working conditions in their suppliers' factories. Yet poor old Shell, which had spent a lot of money on trying to be a good corporate citizen, encountered a storm after it said it would dump the Brent Spar oil-platform in an ocean trench-even though the idea eventually proved reasonable. Similarly, Monsanto, an American firm that has shown a keen interest in the triple bottom line, is now a bogeyman in Europe because it makes genetically modified organisms. Ethical behaviour offers some insurance against public-relations disasters, but it is by no means a guarantee. 
sions, and without a bid-offer spread, will be launched in the second half of 2000. Smaller broker-dealers will find it particularly hard to cope in this new environment. They may have to slim down services, such as research, which is traditionally paid for through trading commission, in order to trim costs. Posit, a similar system, which allows institutional investors to deal with each other blindly-thus lessening the risk that the market will move away from them when they place a large order-will further develop and expand its young business. Other electronic networks, such as Island, one of the best-known American ECNS, will consider expanding into Europe. 
European exchanges will struggle to establish a viable alternative to America's NASDAQ, where Microsoft is listed, for young European high-tech companies. NASDAQ's listings of European equities have stalled since the launch of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt in March 1997. The Neuer Markt faces new competition from techMARK, the London Stock Exchange's new market for technology stocks, and reinvigorated rivalry from its four fellow euro-zone partners in Euro NM, an alliance of markets for young high-tech companies from EASDAQ, which was also set up as a direct copy of NASDAQ. 
Europe's 31 depositories will come under pressure to consolidate from Europe's banks, which are irate at being asked to pay for overlapping and incompatible systems. Smaller depositories will be encouraged to sign up for one of three models of integration on offer. Euroclear, the international bond clearing house, while it has the support of the big international banks for its ""hub and spokes"" model, will struggle to gain the co-operation of other European clearing houses, until its ties with operator J.P. Morgan are finally severed in 2002. That may give its rival, Cedel, time to make progress in its establishment of a ""European Clearing House"". London's Crest will also tie up a few more countries' clearing systems, along with Ireland's and Switzerland's, into its network. By the end of 2000, Europe will not have a single market for European equities, but the shape of the new market will become clearer. 
Goodbye to Glass-Steagall, the law that kept American 
financial services apart. Now banking-braking-insuring conglomerates will form rapidly. 
More strength to Wall Street. 
Pam Woodall: economics editor, The Economist.  1999 ""Goodness is greed."" Such would be the text of Gordon Gekko, the beastly broker from Wall Street, were he today to preach how firms should conduct themselves in 2000. Companies increasingly seem to think that being ""ethical"" will make them rich. Groups as different as Electrolux, a Swedish white-goods firm, and DuPont, an American chemicals giant, have taken to the idea that the best way to be nice to your shareholders is to be nice to your workers and your environment too. 
The ethics of self interest is not a new philosophy, but it is moving inexorably from the campaigners' den to the boardroom. Firms that once attracted the fury of non-governmental organisations (NGOS) have crossed the barricades. Rio Tinto and Placer Dome, two mining companies, are part of a consortium that is setting out to advise firms on how to provide health care for the people living around their mines. Similar guidelines are being drawn up by a body that sets standards for a group of oil companies, including Royal Dutch/Shell and BP. The World Health Organisation, under its new head, Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway, has for the first time begun to work closely with private companies. In 1999 De Beers, another mining firm, paid $2.7m to help eradicate polio in Angola. 
Such collaboration is becoming almost fashionable. A survey of 133 NGOS, published by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accountancy firm, found that their attitudes to business are rapidly changing. NGOS currently take a dim view of multinational companies, with 41% describing relations as ""antagonistic"" and 62% believing that capitalists do not much care about ethics. But the same NGOS thought that in the future (the survey did not specify when) the share of multinational companies that want to co-operate with NGOS will increase fivefold, to 61%; they expected the share behaving ethically to double, to 47%. 
Such changes are thanks partly to investors. Those who want an easy conscience have plenty of choice.

Edward Carr: business editor, The Economist.  1999 Emerging markets are back on line. Net private inflows of capital into the emerging economies will total around $120 billion in 2000, a 75% increase on 1999 levels. Latin America will receive the major share, the result of having rich old Uncle Sam next door and a relatively well-established rule of law. Although flows into Asia are looking healthier, the region will suffer a net outflow as loans are repaid. A return to the 1996 inflow of $100 billion is unlikely for at least the next three years. Problems in Indonesia and China will get worse before they get better. And investors know it.  1999 In a few years' time our e-wise grandchildren will wonder how on earth a market worked without the Internet. Such is the sublime ease with which it brings buyers and sellers together, transfers information-everyone's favourite commodity-and allows you to buy and sell any time, any place, that real markets seem hopelessly clumsy in comparison. 
You may well want to disabuse these youngsters over their cyber-naivety, but when it comes to trading shares on the Internet they will definitely be on to something. The trick with equity trading is simple: the Internet allows far more people into the market, settlement can be made just by switching a few digits around in cyberspace and you can trade when you want, where you want. The Internet and share-trading are, in short, what the word synergy was invented for. 
So prediction number one: massive growth. Jupiter Communications, an IT consultancy, estimates that by 2003 online brokerages will be managing assets worth $3 trillion. That is roughly equivalent to what the top three investment banks held in 1998, a sizable slice of the international asset pie. Forrester, another IT consultancy, predicts that the number of households with online accounts will more than quadruple over the next three years from 5m in 1999. In Japan, investors will use their games consoles to trade. 
For many, the obvious winners of the current trend are the big discounters such as E*Trade (the largest Internet-only broker), Datek and Ameritrade, which stack trades high and sell them low. These are the brokers of choice for America's 5,000 day-traders. 
Yet, for all the radical new dynamics at the core of the e-brokerage business model lies an old-fashioned economic conundrum-the pay-off between price and value. Low prices are not everything-many people would prefer some advice too. That is why even after 20 years of deregulated commission rates, American discounters have cornered only 25% of the retail market. With ""free trades"" probably arriving in 2000 (paid for by those guys in advertising), revenues will undoubtedly fall. Thus prediction number two: price wars will lead to largely pyrrhic victories for a few discounters. 
In reaction, many companies will attempt to add value to lowish prices. Traditional discounters are moving upstream to become ""mid-tier"" firms. Charles Schwab and Fidelity will seek to sell advice, portfolio management and even banking services to their clients. Forrester estimates that assets managed by the mid-tiers will grow tenfold by 2003 to $1.5 trillion. 
Prediction three is cataclysmic: the end of fullservice brokering as we know it. Many analysts believe that the current 20% of all the retail trade done on the Internet will rise to 50% by 2001. And the Internet, already awash with financial information, is quickly undermining the rationale for paying high prices-$100300 per transaction compared with $15 from a discounter-for informed trades. This means pain for the full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch over the next five years. Until now they have remained confident that the quality of their research would keep customers loyal. They also feared that by going online they would cannibalise their traditional business. Led by Prudential, many took their first steps online in 1999. Yet 2000 will be the year when they begin successfully to evolve, or have their fates sealed as financial dinosaurs. Watch them travel downstream with Internet operations, lower prices and brand-based advertising campaigns to do battle with the mid-tier firms. 
And now the bad news 
So prediction four appears obvious: cheaper prices, better information and wealthier individual investors. Only that it is not. Share prices go up and down even in cyberspace. The problem is that someone somewhere has to lose money; it does not matter whether the information you have bought is good-it has to be better than your competitors'. That might encourage you to pay a premium for top-notch research. Or, if you know about the efficient-market hypothesis, it might cause you to despair. 
The hypothesis, a basic plank of finance theory, dirties an otherwise rosy picture. It holds that you cannot beat the market since all the information available to you is already reflected in the share price. And with a thousand other online investors better informed and a few seconds quicker than you are, what hope is there of consistently making a buck? 
Research in America shows that three in every four daytraders make a loss. And that is in a bull market. Calls to provide new regulations for a newish industry will only get stronger with any future sustained market fall. Those instant-riches advertisements look naive now-with a big fall they may appear criminally irresponsible. And in America, you know what that means. 
Thus to cater for the more cautious investment generation who prefer mutual funds, the Internet will provide two key services: ease of transaction and price transparency. Internet buying of mutuals will boom. Financial planning sites will proliferate. Fund companies who present their products in the best possible statistical light will have their products compared using common standards. This transparency is a good thing and will lead, the fifth prediction, to better-value funds. A help, no doubt, in paying for educating those e-wise descendants.  1999 Europe's stock exchanges will have to fight three battles in 2000. First, their strategy to consolidate trading across borders to create one pool of liquidity will be countered by the emergence of electronic communications networks (ECNS); these will offer cheaper, and often anonymous, ways of doing business. Second, the new European markets for high-growth companies will each vie to be seen as the NASDAQ of Europe, as will NASDAQ itself. Third, Europe's clearing houses, the Cinderellas of the trading world, will fight it out to see which becomes the leader. All of this will take place against a shift towards equities across Europe as governments make clear that individuals must provide for most of their own retirement costs. 
The failure of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Deutsche Borse to produce the truly unified trading platform that they promised when they unveiled an alliance in July 1998 has left a void in European trading. Paul Roy, head of equities at Merrill Lynch, an American investment bank, says the substitute proposal, to link brokerages to a number of exchanges electronically, is not enough. However, others argue that modern technology makes this the obvious shortterm solution. Bengt Ryden, head of Stockholm's stock exchange, which itself is a listed company, boycotted the eightcountry alliance headed by London and Frankfurt, preferring instead to let foreign brokerages connect electronically to Stockholm. 
Europe's exchanges will realise that their main competition is no longer from each other. New scNS will make an attractive bid for trading volume, promising what London-Frankfurt failed to deliver: a single platform for pan-European stock trading. Tradepoint, which failed to make an impression against London when first launched, looks better positioned following a refinancing which has included most of the big investment banks. True, its owners will continue to gain more from trading through traditional exchanges, but they know that their own clients, the ""buy-side"" asset managers and pension funds, may bypass them altogether if they do not move with the times. E-Crossnet, a mechanism for fund managers to buy and sell shares without having to pay broker commissions, and without a bid-offer spread, will be launched in the second half of 2000. Smaller broker-dealers will find it particularly hard to cope in this new environment. They may have to slim down services, such as research, which is traditionally paid for through trading commission, in order to trim costs. Posit, a similar system, which allows institutional investors to deal with each other blindly-thus lessening the risk that the market will move away from them when they place a large order-will further develop and expand its young business. Other electronic networks, such as Island, one of the best-known American sots, will consider expanding into Europe. 
European exchanges will struggle to establish a viable alternative to America's NASDAQ, where Microsoft is listed, for young European high-tech companies. NASDAQ's listings of European equities have stalled since the launch of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt in March 1997. The Neuer Markt faces new competition from techniK, the London Stock Exchange's new market for technology stocks, and reinvigorated rivalry from its four fellow euro-zone partners in Euro NM, an alliance of markets for young high-tech companies from EASDAQ, which was also set up as a direct copy of NASDAQ. 
Europe's 31 depositories will come under pressure to consolidate from Europe's banks, which are irate at being asked to pay for overlapping and incompatible systems. Smaller depositories will be encouraged to sign up for one of three models of integration on offer. Euroclear, the international bond clearing house, while it has the support of the big international banks for its ""hub and spokes"" model, will struggle to gain the co-operation of other European clearing houses, until its ties with operator J.P. Morgan are finally severed in 2002. That may give its rival, Cedel, time to make progress in its establishment of a ""European Clearing House"". London's Crest will also tie up a few more countries' clearing systems, along with Ireland's and Switzerland's, into its network. By the end of 2000, Europe will not have a single market for European equities, but the shape of the new market will become clearer. 
Margaret Doyle: financial correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Will the dramatic expansion of global stockmarket capitalisation from $9.3 trillion in 1990 to about $25 trillion hold? As a result of the bull market on Wall Street, the United States now accounts for about half the world's stockmarket capitalisation compared with only about 30% in 1990. Japan, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% to only about 11%, its lowest share since the early 1950s. The growth of America's stockmarket capitalisation has played a decisive role in powering the growth of both consumer spending and capital investment. But with stockmarket capitalisation at 150% of cDr compared with an average of 49% over the previous 60 years, there is a risk that a correction will have a more depressing impact on domestic spending than previous bear markets. This inflation of asset values-and the knock-on effect that a correction of, say, 25% would have on the real economy-will be Alan Greenspan's greatest single preoccupation in 2000. 
The driving force in the expansion of the American equity market has been the spectacular performance of the technology sector. It has expanded to a market capitalisation of over $2.7 trillion. It now accounts for about a quarter of America's overall stockmarket capitalisation compared with 10% in 1990. The changing composition of the equity market reflects the fact that information technology now accounts for about 20% of American capital stock compared with 18% in Britain, 14% in Sweden, 11% in Germany and 8% in Japan. The leader in this process has been Microsoft, which enjoys a market capitalisation of some $500 billion. If Microsoft can sustain the growth performance of 1998 and early 1999 for another year, it will soon qualify to join the Group of Seven rich countries by boasting a market capitalisation larger than Canada's GDr. But whereas technology has boomed, the value of traditional sectors such as mining and heavy industry has slumped. In mid1999, the total market capitalisation of the global metals industry, including steel mills, gold mines, copper mines and other mineral companies, was only about $320 billion, or just over 60% of the market capitalisation of Microsoft. Watch for the ability of high-tech stocks to deliver profits in 2000. But note how this huge change will likewise change society in the years ahead. Nowhere will change more in 2000 than Japan. In the modern era, Japan has had a system of stakeholder capitalism in which profits played a less decisive role in corporate decision-making than concerns about sales, asset size and employment. The result is that Japanese firms have a return on equity of only 2%, compared with 20% in the United States and 15% in Western Europe. But the collapse of profitability has triggered a stockmarket decline which is setting the stage for a revolution in the relationship between management and shareholders. As a result of depressed equity-market returns, Japanese firms have an unfunded pension Liability of 80 trillion ($730 billion). They will probably correct it by injecting into the pension pot a large share of the corporate crossshareholdings, which have been the financial counterpart of stakeholder capitalism. When this adjustment occurs, Japan will have a powerful constituency demanding that firms focus more attention on profitability for the first time in its modern history. Ironically, the ageing of Japanese society will compel the private sector to introduce a more dynamic form of capitalism in order to satisfy the income needs of the growing population of retired people. 
Look for dramatic change in Europe. Take Germany's rapidly growing marketplace, called the Neuer Markt, with over 125 small technology companies and an aggregate market capitalisation of about $40 billion. Software companies account for 22% of the market while Internet service providers and other Internet companies make up another 20%. The rise of the new market represents the most dramatic breakthrough in the development of a popular equity culture in Germany since the second world war. This is not just a new market, it is a new mind-set. It bodes well for Frankfurt and ill for the City of London. Indeed, whereas the German stockmarket once experienced trading pauses on Jewish holidays, volume now slumps when student holidays occur. 
2000 will see large chunks of the world with new-and much improvedbanking systems. Latin America has opened up its financial system to foreign investment so much that over half of all bank assets now belong to foreigncontrolled institutions. Argentina has gone the furthest because its use of a currency board means that its central bank can no longer be the lender of last resort. And as a result of the ownership changes since 1995, Argentina's banks now depend upon lenders of last resort in London, Madrid, Hong Kong and Washington, not just Buenos Aires. Due to the recent financial crisis, Asia is also opening up to foreign investment in the financial system. In another 12 months, foreign institutions will probably control at least 40% of the banking systems of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia compared with nothing five years ago. In Eastern Europe the story is the same. German, Dutch, Irish and Austrian banks now control over half of all bank assets in Poland, and in Hungary foreigners have almost a 90% market share. Estonia, another currency-board country, has sold about 80% of its banking system to the Swedes. Future banking crises will be lesser, more controllable, phenomena as a result. 
Will emerging markets upset the apple cart? Their stockmarket capitalisation declined by several hundred million dollars during 1998 after expanding from $488 billion to $2.2 trillion between 1988 and 1996. The developing countries' share of global stockmarket capitalisation is now only 8% compared with 14% in 1996. But the contraction has created the potential for a tremendous catch-up. After all, these same countries will account for 45% of world output, 70% of the world's land area, 85% of the world's population and 99% of the projected growth in the global labour force during the early decades of the 21st century. 
Popular share ownership has grown dramatically in many countries as a result of the 1990s stockmarket boom. The United States mutual-funds industry now has assets larger than the banking system. It is estimated that 45% of Americans are in the market either directly or through mutual funds, compared with 5% in the 1950s. Australia now has more shareholders than trade-union members. The collapse of interest rates which resulted from monetary union in Europe has also encouraged a dramatic growth of the mutual-fund sector in countries such as Italy and Spain. During 1998 Italian mutual funds attracted over 35 billion ($37 billion) of retail-savings flows while Spain's mutual funds received nearly 10 billion. Many developing countries are introducing pension funds in order to promote wider share ownership and help finance privatisation of state enterprises. Singapore began the process during the 1960s. Chile went further during the 1980s. Today, there are several Latin American countries with pension funds which have an aggregate market value of over $150 billion. When the cold war ended, there were probably only 100m people on the planet who owned a share or had a pension plan. By 2000 there will be over one billion shareholders in both the industrial and developing countries. The resultant change in world politics is palpable-and wholly for the good. 
China is now so anxious to stimulate consumer spending that its government has begun to talk up the stockmarket. There were editorials in the People's Daily during the summer of 1999 calling upon investors to buy equities. The government is liberalising its rules for bank lending to brokerage firms. Officials also say that private firms, not just former state enterprises, will be able to list on the market. But policy will have to remain supportive of the market for some time if rising equity prices are to buoy the economy. China's market capitalisation is only about 25% of GDP there are only 35m shareholders. 
The growth of retail-share ownership has not reduced the role of institutional investors in the market. In the case of the United States, the expansion of mutual funds to $6 billion of assets has increased the power of large institutions. Firms with more than $100m under management now control equities worth about 51% of America's market capitalisation, compared with 27.6% in 1980. The result of this increasing concentration in market share has been to produce an institutional bias in favour of large companies, which has caused them significantly to outperform smaller companies during the 1990s. This is an unhealthy development. Watch for the start of a correction in 2000. 
The new role of stockmarkets as storehouses of personal wealth and engines of capital formation suggests that they will play a far more important role in the formulation of public policy than ever before. Governments everywhere are being compelled to give their citizens more options for their retirement savings than just government debt. Central banks are increasingly being forced to make judgments about equity markets when determining whether monetary policy should be adjusted. 
There is little doubt, for example, that the Federal Reserve would welcome a modest stockmarket correction in the United States in order to slow the growth rate of domestic consumption. Every January, the Wall Street Journal conducts a survey of United States forecasters to find out their predictions for the year ahead. Since 1994, the consensus has been a projection of only 2.3% output growth compared with an actual outcome of 3.5% a year. 
The task confronting the Federal Reserve in 2000 is to engineer a soft landing in which equity prices do not fall too far. The challenge is unique because the United States has a huge currentaccount deficit. America's households have been on a buying spree that has kept the rest of the world from recession. But this deficit has been financed only by foreigners buying American equity. If the stockmarket were to fall sharply, there is a risk that the dollar could also collapse, with destabilising consequences for bond prices and all financial assets. As a result, both the United States economy and the global economy are now more dependent upon the performance of the New York equity market than at any other time in history. 
David Hale: chief investment analyst, Zurich Financial Services, Chicago.  1999 After a run of several thousand years, it is entirely fitting that 2000 will be marked as the year the tide turned against taxation. Clay tablets recall the taxes of Hammurabi in the Babylon of 2000BC, but the practice is certainly older. People in power have always tried to divert some of the proceeds of economic activity in their own direction. Lords took feudal dues from their vassals; landowners took tolls from merchants; gangsters took protection money from small businesses; governments took taxes from their citizens. Despite the different names, the principle has remained constant: those who do not produce take resources from those who do, and spend it on altogether different things. 
The tide is turning because of the convergence of several factors. In the first place, taxes are becoming harder to collect. Capital is more mobile than ever, and inclined to fly from places that tax to places that do not. Governments do not move their boundaries and jurisdictions as rapidly as companies can change locations. Attempts to establish trans-national tax powers are almost certainly doomed by international competition to attract economic activity. Many businesses will choose to stay out of reach. 
The global economy and the Internet mean that purchases can now cross frontiers. People buy books, clothes and cars from abroad, and any finance minister who likes to tax these items finds his tax base diminishing. It is not only capital and goods which are harder to pin down. Even wages are crossing frontiers. The rise of the service sector means that many income-generating activities can take place across frontiers, causing yet more headaches for overstretched public treasuries. Furthermore, the pace of electronic, hard-to-trace activity is accelerating. 
No less important has been the rise of political resistance. The past quarter century has been marked by a movement led in Britain and America towards tax limitation. It announced itself in California's famous tax-cutting referendum Proposition 13, but saw its fullest expression in the Thatcher and Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s. Britain's Tories entered office in 1979 with the top rate of income tax at 98%, and left office 18 years later with a top rate of 40%. Indeed, their Labour opponents became electable only after a firm promise not to raise it again. In the United States, George W Bush would not make his father's mistake of increasing taxes despite a ""read my lips"" pledge. The plain fact is that electorates these days will not stand for it. They recognise, correctly, that governments spend their money less carefully and less efficiently than they can spend it themselves. 
One of the greatest uses of tax money is to provide pensions. And here a revolution-as important and pervasive as privatisation-is sweeping the world. Fully funded personal pension plans, based on an individual's savings, are sweeping away the poorly funded public pensions promised by governments. The latter take taxes from the young to support the old. The former invest savings from the young to support themselves when old. 
A lead all will follow 
Singapore blazed the trail in the 1950s with individual provident accounts, but it was when Chile pioneered the replacement of state pensions with private funds in 1981 that the world took notice. Their lead set a pattern which has increasingly been followed in South America and, more recently, Poland. Britain itself has largely converted to private 
personal funds, whose total value, well in excess of $1 trillion, exceeds that of all of its EU partners combined. Britain's vestigial state pensions are of ever-diminishing significance. 
Tax-transfer schemes are vulnerable to demographic changes. If the numbers of old people increase, if they require support for more years, or if the numbers in work decrease, the adverse balance can impose unacceptable tax burdens on the young. Belgium, France, Italy and Germany most of all, have yet to face the tax consequences of their profligate promissory notes. Their expensive attempts to do so will provide one of the main economic dramas of the next decade. It is also the case that funded pensions give better value. The fund grows with the economy, aiding it in turn with investment, and achieving better returns than can be relied on from governments. 
Taxes are thus being squeezed from three directions: the increased mobility brought by globalisation, electoral resistance to taxation, and a movement away from tax-funded schemes. All of this will make life difficult for finance ministers. The solution in Britain has been to opt for ""stealth"" taxes which do not show, but few suppose this will be more than a temporary expedient. A more permanent solution will be for finance ministers to recognise their limitations and for governments to live within their means. Money-laundering becomes easy in Brazil with the arrival of 250m plastic banknotes in April.  1999 Uncle Sam's commercial domination is only in its infant stage, asserts Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, an advertising giant. 
Theodore Levitt may have got it wrong. In 1983 he wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review saying that we were all going to market global products and services in the same way everywhere. Twenty years on, the thesis seems wrong in one particular respect: there is not a global way of marketing, rather there is an American way. America's business methods have become the world's. 
If you are going to run or develop a business of global significance, domination of the American market is critical. In almost every category of industry or services, the real winners will be those companies that have strong franchises rooted in the United States. In advertising and marketing services, for example, approximately 45% of the expenditure in this $1 trillion industry originates in the United States. About two-- thirds of this expenditure is controlled or, to be more politically correct, is ""influenced"" from there. 
The same is true of many other industries, particularly for those companies that seek to share information efficiently around the world. Chief executives may devolve power to regional or brand-based business units, but they also want to ensure that wheels are not being needlessly reinvented in international organisations. The controls they put in place are usually rooted in America. 
This economic power and the relative homogeneity of the American market are being exploited ruthlessly as American corporations push their products and services around the world. Thus there is not a global standard, in the Levitt sense, but an American one. It is a standard driven by the need to hit financial targets demanded by shareholders. 
If you tell the Street or the City that you intend to increase your profits or earnings per share or return on capital, by 5% to 15% a year, you can do it only by taking share from a competitor or expanding globally. Expansion is probably easier and more profitable. 
But a decision to expand internationally faces every chief executive with three problems. And the answer to each of these reinforces the conclusion that to be global it is necessary to be American. 
The first is brand. To gain marketshare companies need to brand products ever more strongly; and many of the most powerful brands, of course, are American. 
The second is the web, which threatens to shake up every product and service without exception. The web may be global but its culture and driving force is American. 
The third is the need that every business has to communicate its strategic changes internally as well as externally; if the people within the organisation don't understand policy, then external communication will obviously suffer. This internal communication often follows, or reinforces, an American mind-set. 
If you thought this trend was welldeveloped, just reflect on the fact that the average American-based multinational still derives only 20% of its sales or profits from outside the United States. The average corporation is more like Pepsi-Cola, which still has 80% of its business inside the United States, rather than Coca-Cola, which has 80% outside. So there is still a long way to go. 
If all this were not enough, the dominant position of a strong American market is being reinforced by a strong capital market. Despite a narrowing recently, stockmarket valuations on the American side of the Atlantic are still generally higher. In almost every category this gives American-quoted companies a lower cost of equity capital and hence a lower average cost of capital. As a result, stronger organic growth is being reinforced by stronger growth through acquisitions. Again, this trend will have a long way to go in 2000 and beyond. European-only mergers do not solve the problem. They are purely defensive. If Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia had been brought together, what would this have done in the United States, the largest telecoms market in the world? Nothing. 
Similarly, what does the marriage of Carrefour and Promodes do offensively? Defensively, it may be a way of dealing with the arrival in Europe of America's Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, but for it to succeed it must exploit the advantages afforded it in Latin America and China. 
Europe isn't global 
A more cohesive European market will risk encouraging European-based multinationals to focus too much on Europe and too little on the United States and beyond. Despite a market of 350m people, 100m greater than the United States, Europe's union lacks the homogeneity of the American market. 
What is the answer? The development of global businesses which are rooted in the strongest and most vibrant market in the world-the United States. You only have to review the car industry, any packaged-goods sector, the computer industry, the new technologies and web companies, high-tech and telecommunications, entertainment, media, and health care. Nor is this confined to making things. It also applies to services. Look at the consultancy industry, investment or commercial banking. 
There are companies that understand. sr Amoco and Vodafone lead the way in the United Kingdom. Vivendi leads the French invasion of the United States as does DaimlerChrysler from Germany. Telefonica looks like it will do the same from Spain although it is focusing on Latin America initially. 
The only reason for caution is that we were talking about Japan in the same terms only a decade ago, and look where Japan is now. Trends such as these can go the other way. Historically, they usually do so. Economic and political domination by one state does not usually last long. 
Reading on paper is so much a part of our lives that it is hard to imagine anything could ever replace inky marks on shredded trees. Since Johannes Gutenberg invented an economical way to make movable metal type in the 15th century, making it possible to produce reading matter quickly, comparatively cheaply and in large quantities, the printed word has proved amazingly resilient. So how could anyone believe that sales of electronic books will equal those of paper books within a decade or so? 
First, it is worth remembering that paper is only the latest in a long line 
of reading ""technologies"" that were made obsolete each time an improved solution emerged. Pictures drawn on rock gave way to clay tablets with cuneiform characters pressed into the clay before it dried. Clay gave way to animal skin scrolls marked with text, and then to papyrus scrolls. By 100An the codex had arrived, but it was not until the ninth century that the first real paper book was produced. In Europe, paper was rare until after Gutenberg's breakthrough. 
It took a few more centuries for ebooks to emerge. They were first envisioned in 1945 by Vannevar Bush, director of the United States Office of Scientific Research and Development. In his classic essay, ""As We May Think"", Bush described a gadget he called a ""memex""=`a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications... Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place... Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them..."" 
Although science-fiction writers eagerly adopted Bush's ideas-notably on the television show ""Star Trek"", where portable electronic books featured regularly-the real world has remained loyal to paper. Only in the encyclopedia market, which was transformed by CD-ROMS in the mid-1980s, has the e-book made real progress. Far more encyclopedias, from Microsoft's Encarta to Encyclopedia Britannica, are sold on cn-ROM than were ever sold on paper, because they cost a fraction of the price and are easier to search. But attempts to broaden the appeal of e-book technology to ""ludic"" (or pleasure) readers have been unsuccessful. Since the late 1980s the electronic publishing world has seen several failed e-book ventures. 
Why? Most of them used devices that were either too bulky to carry around, or forced users to ""stock up"" their electronic library in inconvenient ways. (One required visits to a ""book bank"", an ATM-- like machine that was to be located in bookstores.) Before widespread adoption of the Internet, there was no universal way to download new reading material. But the most fundamental problem was the lack of a display technology that could compete with paper when it came to ludic reading. 
For paper books, readability depends on many factors: typeface and size, line length and spacing, page and margin size, and the colour of print and paper. But for e-books there are even more factors, including resolution, flicker, luminance, contrast and glare. Most typefaces were not designed for screens and, thanks to a limited number of pixels, are just fuzzy reproductions of the originals. The result is that reading onscreen is hard on the eyes and takes a lot more effort. People do it only for short documents. The longer the read, the more irritating and distracting are all the faults in display, layout and rendering. 
Most of these problems are now being solved. The World Wide Web offers an amazingly flexible way to deliver books in bits-and as investments in broadband infrastructure increase, it will get even easier to stock an e-library. And dozens of companies-including e-book pioneers and established publishing firms such as R.R. Donnelly, Penguin Putnam, Nokia, Barnes & Noble and Microsoft-have joined to create an open e-book standard, so that book-lovers will be able to read any title on any e-book. 
There have also been some incredible technological breakthroughs that will make it much easier to read long texts on a screen. Microsoft has developed a font display technology called ClearType that, by manipulating the red, green and blue sub-pixels that make up the pixels on an Lcn screen, improves resolution by up to a factor of three. Coupled with the latest e-book reading software and hardware, this provides an on-screen reading experience that begins to rival paper. 
But why would anyone prefer an e-- book to a p-book, regardless of improved readability? Because e-books have many other advantages. You will get instant delivery from your web bookshop to your e-book, and be able to store hundreds of novels on a device the size of a paperback. E-book technology enables you to have an entire library in your pocket. Or you can keep it on your PC-a modern laptop can hold more than 30,000 books. You won't have to wait for out-of-stock books to be ordered, and books will never go out of ""print"". Your children will be able to listen to unfamiliar words pronounced for them as they read. You will have unabridged audio synchronised to the text, so you can continue the story in situations where you are unable to read-for example, while driving. 
In addition, e-books promise to revolutionise the way the world reads. Whereas paper books are stand-alone entities, e-books can include hypertext links to additional content, whether it is in other books, databases or web sites. So e-books will not be restricted to a linear structure that is the same for everyone-every reader will be free to make use of the links, images and sounds dif ferently. You will also be able to customise e-books by adding your own notes, links and images. In a paper book, content is fixed; with e-book technology it is flexible. Finally, you will be able to get sound and moving images to support the text, creating an entirely new multimedium. 
The e-book will also revolutionise the economics of the industry. The cost of publishing books will fall dramatically, the result of savings on materials, labour, manufacturing and distribution. In the process, a lot of trees will also be saved and even the most obscure author will be able to self-publish, which means more choice for readers. The retail price of books will fall; sales will explode. 
It is hard to imagine today, but one of the greatest contributions of e-books may eventually be in improving literacy and education in less-developed countries. Today people in poor countries cannot afford to buy books and rarely have access to a library. But in a few years, as the cost of hardware continues to decline, it will be possible to set up ""virtual"" public libraries which will have access to the same content as the Library of Congress. 
An asteroid probably wiped out 
the dinosaurs. Do humans have a 
similar fate? NASA's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft will start orbiting Asteroid ""433 Eros"", the first of our efforts to know the enemy.  1999 European corporate finance is mid-way through a vast change. The past few years have brought what seemed like a wave of Americanisation. In fact, it was a trickle. The tidal wave arrives in 2000. In the coming years, Europe's biggest companies will swap their equity for debt, changing the whole profile of European finance. 
As with much else in modern economics, the root cause is disinflation. Over the past 30 inflationary years, investors have been interested in little besides equity, because dividends, being variable, can be adapted to rising prices. But equity is risky. Holders are the last to benefit in the event of a liquidation. It is a post-tax cost. It is therefore an expensive form of finance. Debt, by contrast, is less risky and a fixed, pre-tax cost. So the supply of equity is drying up. Companies are either taking themselves off the stockmarket or buying in their equity. 
What about demand? The demographic bulge created by the baby boom after the second world war has generally had a prosperous and satisfying life. It is now approaching the age of retirement. If you wanted to swap a lump sum in savings for a regular cash income, how would you do it? 
The stockmarket? Lucent Technologies, a key supplier of hardware to the Internet and a darling of the stockmarket, produced a capital return of nearly 80% in the 12 months to September 1999. That's a sweet profit. But Lucent's yield-the amount it returns in dividend income per dollar investedis currently a tenth of a cent in the dollar, 0.1%. Microsoft, an even better known success story, yields nothing. 
These cases are exceptional, of course. But they illustrate the lie of markets as a whole. The average British equity yields 2.5%. In the United States it is 1.3% and in Japan 0.7%. Moreover, average equity yields are falling. High-yield stocks are the ones switching to debt. In the United Kingdom in 1999, with few exceptions, new equity was issued exclusively by low-yield, highly valued, new technology companies, the Lucents and Microsofts of the future. 
What about government bonds? They still carry a yield and in many leading markets they are near enough to riskfree. True, but with the end of inflation government yields are increasingly reflecting that lack of risk. The difference in yield between a three-month American dollar deposit and a 30-year Treasury bond is scarcely more than one percentage point. In the United Kingdom, the yield on a 30-year government bond is, crazily, 0.5% lower than the interest rate on a three-month deposit. Meanwhile, a 30-year Japanese government bond currently yields 2.7% in total. 
Over the medium to longer term the yield on government stock is likely to continue to decline. This is because the supply is drying up. With the Republican bill to cut taxes having run into the presidential veto, it seems all but certain that the federal surplus that is currently accumulating in the United States will be used to pay down public debt. More important, the word on the campaign trail is that this is what voters want. The resuit will be a reduction in the Treasury market of nearly a third over the next ten years. Excepting Japan, a similar story can be told of most other rich countries, even including Italy. 
Compare the following. A bond issued by the Halifax, a British mortgage lender, paying interest at 9.4% and with 21 years to run, now yields 6.3%. This is 1.3 percentage points higher than the equivalent government bond and three percentage points above the Halifax's own dividend yield. The Halifax has a double-A credit rating, not much below that of a government. Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB, with a triple-B rating, yields 8.1% on its ten-year bondnearly three percentage points more than the equivalent government bond and 7.6 points above BSkyB's dividend yield. 
The spreads in the United States are equally attractive. A ten-year bond issued by Ford yields 7.3%, compared with less than 6% for the comparable Treasury. A 20-year bond issued by Sprint, a successful telephone company with a credit rating equivalent to BSkyB, yields 9.3%, against the 6% current yield on the 30-year Treasury. But buy Sprint's equity on the stockmarket and you will only get a dividend of about 1%. 
In the first nine months of 1999 some $30 billion went out of the British equity market by way of share buybacks, while about $45 billion was raised in new capital through issues of sterling corporate bonds. This is but a pointer for 2000. The figures for the United States are in similar proportion, but it is in Europe as a whole that there is the potential for enormous growth. Corporate gearing in the United States is above 60%, three-quarters of which is obtained through the bond markets. In Europe, gearing is below 30%, with less than a third of debt sourced through the bond markets. So expect changes in 2000. Less equity. More debt.  1999 Reading on paper is so much a part of our lives that it is hard to imagine anything could ever replace inky marks on shredded trees.

Bill Gates: chairman of Microsoft.  1999 If you take the game of life seriously, if you take your nervous system seriously, if you take your sense organs seriously, then, over the course of this coming year, you must turn on, tune in and drop out. And buy up too, if you are one of millions of patients now heeding Timothy Leary's advice and turning to complementary medicine. Over two-fifths of Americans will use some sort of unconventional therapy, according to David Eisenberg, at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. Almost half of all Germans and perhaps a third of Britons will also try acupuncture, chiropracty, herbal remedies or some other complementary treatment for relief. 
Leary, who knew a thing or two about drugs, would have been pleased. So too are the growing ranks of complementary practitioners and firms producing dietary supplements and herbal compounds. Dr Eisenberg's surveys estimate that Americans paid 629m visits to complementary therapists in 1997, a 46% increase since 1990 and almost two-thirds more consultations than mainstream primary care doctors performed. Americans will spend some $30 billion on complementary treatments, much of it out of their own pockets. In Britain, France and Germany, there will be a similar boom. 
This hardly surprises William Haskell of Stanford University's Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Programme. Although the popularity of complementary treatments differs from country to country (the French, for example, are keener on homeopathy than Americans, who favour chiropracty), their general success is driven by much the same forces. Patients are increasingly frustrated with the limitations of mainstream, western medicine to deal with their complaints. Conventional medicine is only starting to come to grips with ill-defined chronic ailments, such as memory loss, and lifestyle complaints, among them impotence, which will increasingly plague the world's ageing population. 
Much of complementary medicine, however, from spinal alignment to traditional Chinese herbs, is pitched at just these long-term imbalances; users see them not only as a means of relieving disease in the sick, but of promoting health in the worried well. As America's private medical providers, the health maintenance organisations, try to live up to their name and reduce their costs, Dr Haskell believes they will start to include complementary medicine in their basic coverage, further enhancing its popularity. Although fiscal pressures are forcing some countries, such as France, to question the state's subsidy of complementary therapies, consumer demand is likely to increase government reimbursement in the coming years. 
Of course, the appeal of complementary medicine lies not only in the counter-culture, but in the over-thecounter-culture as well. Many patients, better informed about health and keen for a greater say in their medical treatment, choose complementary therapies precisely because they have the freedom to do so without prescription. In America, almost half of all complementary medicine is do-it-yourself care. When patients do visit a complementary practitioner, many find the interaction far more rewarding than a trip to the general practitioner. Since much of complementary medicine focuses on broad holistic factors, such as diet or emotional state, consultations are usually longer and wider-ranging than a busy primary care physician can afford. 
Western medicine, however, is very nimble in adopting tricks from other disciplines and from different cultures. In America, mainstream multinational prescription-drug companies, such as American Home Products and Bayer, have launched brands of herbal supplements to take advantage of the $2.6 billion market, which is expected to more than double by 2003. Almost two-thirds of American medical schools now teach courses in complementary medicine and older practising physicians, while perhaps not embracing complementary medicine, at least no longer dismiss it. Even in China where traditional and western medical practice have existed side-by-side for years, Dr Eisenberg notes growing moves among practitioners to combine the best elements of both. Indeed, where once complementary medicine was known as ""alternative"" (or worse), watch for the spread of ""integrative"" medical clinics in the coming year. 
Science will drive many complementary therapies into mainstream clinical practice, and others into the bin. At the moment, there are few authoritative clinical trials or laboratory tests to assess the claims of such treatments. That is set to change as a number of large clinical trials, co-ordinated by America's National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, take place in 2000. They will establish whether, say, St John's Wort is better at relieving mild depression than Prozac or if shark's cartilage is any good for lung cancer. 
Such proof will come in handy as complementary remedies confront the regulators. Unlike conventional drugs, dietary supplements can be sold in America without prior approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration, which strikes many critics as an unsound, unsafe arrangement. 
Some firms, among them Britain's Phytopharm, are trying to rescue herbal mixtures from the hinterland of dietary supplements and establish them as a new class of drug with full regulatory approval. As the ancient Chinese proverb says, ""Real gold is not afraid of the hottest fire."" In 2000, complementary medicine will have to prove its mettle. 
Britain's University for Industry begins full operations. It will run a nationwide network of 1,000 learning centres. 
Shereen El Feki: health care correspondent, The Economist.  1999 And you thought there was only one Internet? Internet2 (I2) is an American university-led venture, which is being used to create the Internet infrastructure of the future. In 2000, campus networks will gain access to a vastly improved form of multicasting and the revolutionary Quality of Service (Qos). What is more, companies will soon begin to enjoy the fruits of these high-tech endeavours. 
The 12 network is named ""Abilene"", after the railhead that opened America's west. It is based on a new protocol, IPv6-you currently use IPv4-and currently wires up 150 universities. This protocol has massive capacity, is super-reliable and is much, much faster than today's congested info-highway. Abilene can transfer data at 2.4 gigabits a second, 45,000 times faster than a typical modem; imagine ten encyclopedias sent around the world in less than a second. 
Multicast technology allows the same packet of information to be sent to multiple locations. It is already used by 3,000 radio stations, which multicast their audio over the Internet. The magic of IPv6 is that it guarantees image and audio transmission without delay, jerkiness or the odd frame getting lost. It opens the way for web-based television. 
IPv6 also lifts the curtain on Qos. This solves an important part of the net congestion problem by guaranteeing reliable broadband width. Crucially, traffic can be prioritised and delivered almost instantly. Abilene may also soon be transmitting holographic images and its creators are working on a sense of touch. 
In 2000, multicasting will be rolled out on to the campus for further testing. Of course, keeping America's big corporations off the systeman Internet purist's dream-is impossible, not least because they are partially funding the experiment. AT&T, Microsoft, isM, Cisco, MCI WorldCom/Sprint and others are contributing around $50m to the project in the hope that they can use the technology in building company intranets. This will ensure America's decisive lead in Internet technology for another decade.  1999 The first ""working draft"" of the human genome-the digital recipe of our genes -is scheduled to be published early in 2000. It represents a critical milestone in the mammoth international project to decode the entire genetic sequence of man. It will also mark the beginning of a new era in personalised medicine in which a patient's genetic make-up is used to predict and treat illnesses with drugs tailor-made for an individual's inherited predispositions. 
Competing organisations are racing to be the first to sequence and decipher the three billion letters that make up the complete genetic code of human DNA. On one side is the combined might of the American government and the Wellcome Trust, the world's largest medical research charity, which are stumping up most of the $3 billion being spent on the Human Genome Project. On the other is a small, select band of privateers who, with highly specialised equipment and computers, are able to carry out ""fast and dirty"" decoding, which they hope to protect with patents and so reap vast sums from pharmaceutical companies that will need the data for the development of new drugs and medicines. 
One such private operation is run by Craig Venter, a maverick scientist who became disillusioned with the official genome project and so established his own operation with the help of venture capital. His company, Celera Genomics, and its sister operation, the Institute of Genomic Research, in Rockville, Maryland, are the most serious competitors to the publicly funded sequencing project. 
Dr Venter has pioneered a quick method of decoding the genome that was famously derided by James Watson-the co-discoverer of the nrra helix and founding father of the Human Genome Project-as work that ""any monkey"" could do. Celera, however, has already sequenced the entire genetic code of several micro-organisms and has promised a full sequence of the human genome by 2001, two years ahead of the final completion date fixed by the Human Genome Project. In order to recoup the investment in the vast number-crunching operation, Dr Venter intends to charge a fee for organisations to access his genetic database of DNA sequences. 
However, in a deft move aimed at undermining the threat posed by Dr Venter and others, the Human Genome Project has established a consortium which over the next couple of years will throw enormous effort into finding the crucial bits of the human genome that are set to become vital elements of the medicine of the 21st century. The Wellcome Trust is spearheading the consortium along with four of America's most prestigious genetics centres- the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Washington University School of Medicine, Stanford Human Genome Center and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The backers that will finance the project's initial $45m include the leading pharmaceutical businesses. 
The main goal of the consortium is to find the genetic signposts of disease and to publish them on the Internet as soon as they are decoded, thereby preventing others like Dr Venter from patenting the same information. These particular signposts are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS, pronounced ""snips""). They represent the smallest change possible in a gene and as such the genetic difference between one person and another is in effect the result of the differences in their stirs. For every 1,000 ""letters"" in the code of a human gene, there is typically one stir. This means that two unrelated people have, very roughly, a million stirs to distinguish between them. 
SNPS are the ultimate genetic landmarks and will enable scientists to navigate the vast open spaces of the human genome. They are the fine-grained physical features that enable the genetic mapmakers to locate their precise position and, in doing so, to decide whether that particular region of human DNa is medically useful or important. 
SNPS have the advantage of being highly stable. They don't change from one generation to another like some other genetic markers. They are evenly and frequently spaced through the genome (a prerequisite of any good signpost), and they are simple (representing the smallest form of genetic change possible). The consortium believes that building up a map of sNPs will be at the heart of personalised medicine, shifting the focus of treatment from what works best for the majority to what works best for each individual, based on their unique genetic inheritance. 
Conventional genetic tests are used on disorders caused by defects in single genes-such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. New tests based on patterns of stirs will enable doctors to estimate a person's predispositions to a range of other disorders, from asthma and cancer to diabetes and senile dementia, where a number of predisposition genes are thought to be influential. If heart disease tends to run in your family, there should be a set of SNPS that could be used to estimate your risk of heart attack. 
Another, more intriguing, function of an SNP map is in the design, development and use of new drugs. It is well established that some people, for no apparent reason but probably related to their genes, suffer serious side-effects to drugs. sNPS might prove useful in helping to identify those people who will respond best to a certain drug. The new science of pharmacogenomics should make drug prescription less of a hit-or-miss affair. It opens the way for doctors to prescribe more tailor-made medicines that recognise our unique genetic individuality. 
Research under way promises a revolution in medicine. The race between the competitors should, by the end of 2000, decide who picks up the glittering prizes. 
Steve Connor: science editor of The Independent.  1999 Astronomers are currently enjoying a construction boom. The white and silver domes of new telescopes have been popping up like giant mushrooms on otherwise barren mountain-tops in Hawaii and Chile. Many of these will open for business in 2000, causing astronomers' productivity to rise sharply. In the southern hemisphere, in particular, the new observatories will increase the amount of light that astronomers can study by a factor of five. 
It might seem ill-advised, then, to predict that the most surprising (and therefore important) advances in astronomy in 2000 will not be made by studying light. Nevertheless, it is a safe bet. The headline discoveries will belong to those astronomers who study light's shorter-wavelength cousins: x-rays. 
This is not to belittle the new Hawaiian and Chilean telescopes-they are huge. The bigger a telescope's mirror, the dimmer the objects it can see. Each of the new observatories has a primary mirror eight metres in diameter. This makes the previous generation of four-- metre telescopes look puny. 
They are also equipped with the very latest stargazing gadgetry, including the ability to deform their mirrors under computer control, to cancel the blurring and twinkling effects of the atmosphere. This combination of bigness and sharpness makes the new 8-metre class wellsuited to study the remotest objects visible from Earth-the universe's oldest galaxies. By revealing the differences between these ancient galaxies and present-day ones, the new telescopes will help astronomers learn how galaxies change over billions of years, and how galaxies were formed in the first place. 
Impressive as that may be, the new machines are simply bigger and more numerous versions of instruments that already exist. They do not even break any size records-the twin Keck telescopes already sitting on Mauna Kea in Hawaii each measure 10 metres across. 
The real surprises in 2000 will come from celestial x-rays, since two new xray telescopes are about to enter terrain that is almost completely unexplored. An x-ray telescope must be perched in space, rather than on an arid mountaintop, because the atmosphere does not merely blur x-rays; it devours them. This is lucky for humans, who would otherwise be zapped by the sun's x-rays, but it means that x-ray astronomy lags behind that of ordinary light. Each x-ray mission is risky and expensive, but potentially very significant. 
The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched in July 1999 into a high, lazy orbit taking it one-third of the way to the Moon and back. Throughout 2000 (and for five or ten years more) it will be taking x-ray pictures of the universe with unprecedented clarity. In that sense, Chandra is the x-ray equivalent of the Hubble Space Telescope (and also in the sense that it was paid for by NASA, America's space agency, to the tune of $1.4 billion). Not to be outdone, in early 2000 the European Space Agency will launch the X-ray Multi-Mirror (xMM) telescope, which will have even bigger mirrors than Chandra. 
Many different things in the universe emit x-rays, but they all share one common attribute: they are outrageously hot. Well past red-hot and blue-hot, to be x-- hot requires a temperature of tens or hundreds of millions of degrees. X-rays are produced, for example, when a particularly large star runs out of fuel and explodes. Or, if a black hole is close enough to a star to suck away the star's outer layers, the ripped material gets hot enough to emit x-rays. In short, x-rays mark the spots of celestial violence. 
Chandra and XMM will provide much sharper images of all these phenomena. What appear presently to be nebulous blobs of emission might turn out to contain filaments or spots that will reveal what is really going on. 
Joshua Winn: doctoral student in astronomy at hnr.  1999 Global warming will preoccupy the next generation, predicts Sir John Houghton, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
One hundred years ago Claude Monet painted scenes of London through its smoggy atmosphere. That was local pollution. What is relatively new and more worrying is global pollution-that is pollution emitted by people locally that has global effects. The first example to emerge was damage to the earth's ozone layer. International action was promptly taken through the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use of the chemicals responsible. Although full recovery of the ozone layer will now happen, it will take at least a century. 
Another example is pollution that leads to global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse"" gases such as methane are released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and also through deforestation. These gases absorb ""heat"" radiation emitted by the earth's surface that would otherwise be lost to space, so maintaining the surface and the lower atmosphere at a warmer level than normal. 
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has already increased by over 30% since 1750 and, if no action is taken to stem the increase, it will reach double its preindustrial value during the second half of the 21st century. As a result, the average rate of warming of the climate is expected to be greater than at any time during the past 10,000 years. This is not of itself necessarily bad; some communities will experience a net benefit. But many ecosystems as well as humans will find it difficult, if not impossible, to adapt. 
Although there is a lot of uncertainty concerning the detail, the basic science underlying global warming and climate change is well understood. It is not in question. Hundreds of scientists from over 50 countries have contributed as authors or reviewers to the assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (trcc). Because of the uncertainties it is easy either to exaggerate the possible impacts to calamitous proportions or to suggest that too little is known to justify any action. What the iPCC has done is explain clearly what is known together with the major uncertainties. Then, taking account of all relevant scientific data, best estimates have been provided of climate change and its impact over the next century. Here are a few of the ipcc's main findings and an outline of the agenda for the years ahead. 
First, largely because of the thermal expansion of ocean water and the accelerated melting of glaciers, sea levels are likely to rise by approximately half a metre by 2100. Therefore, sea defences in many coastal regions will need to be improved, albeit at considerable cost. However, adaptation is just not possible for countries with large river deltas such as Bangladesh, Southern China and Egypt, and for many island states in the Pacific. 
A second major result of global warming will be, on average, a more intense hydrological cycle leading to impacts on water distribution and availability. In many areas heavy rainfall will tend to become heavier while some semi-arid areas will receive less rainfall. There will be more frequent and more intense floods or droughts, especially in sub-tropical areas. Since, in many places, water is rapidly becoming a critical resource and since floods and droughts are the natural disasters that already cause most deaths, misery and economic damage, these could represent the most damaging impacts of global warming. When combined with the rise in sea levels, a recent study has estimated that this could lead to 150m environmental refugees by 2050. 
Three widely accepted principles will govern the international agreements needed to meet this threat. The first is the ""Precautionary Principle"", already clearly imbedded in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. This states that the existence of uncertainty should not preclude the taking of appropriate action. The reason for such action is simply stated as the stabilisation of the concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere in ways that allow also for necessary economic development. The second principle is the ""Polluter Pays Principle"", which implies the imposition of measures such as carbon taxes or carbon trading arrangements. The third is the ""Principle of Equity (both Intergenerational and International)"" which is the most difficult to apply. However, a proposal of the Global Commons Institute that is being widely discussed applies the second and third principles by allowing eventually for the allocation of carbon emissions to nations on an equal per capita basis while also allowing for emissions trading. 
The action agreed at Kyoto in 1997 is a first step. Necessary post-Kyoto action, however, will be more demanding. The rate of increase of global emissions must first be substantially slowed; then there must be reductions in these emissions to well below 1990 levels before the end of the next century. Many of the required technologies to bring about these reductions are already available, but they require adequate resources for investment and development. Studies show that the necessary action may cost around 1% of the total world product, much less than the likely cost of damage and adaptation if there is no action. 
If human communities are to be fulfilled and creative, they not only need goals related to their economic performance but also moral and spiritual goals. Care for the overall health of the planet is such a goal. It demands action by scientists to provide better information about likely climate change, by governments to set the necessary frameworks for change, by business and industry to seize the opportunities for innovation and the introduction of new technologies, and by all world citizens to support the action being taken and contribute to it.  1999 President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on two counts-perjury before a grand jury and obstruction ol justice-arising from his concealment of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Yet the public continued to support the president: in November's elections, his party, the Democrats, gained House seats midway through a Democratic term for the first time since the 1930s. 
Governor George Bush of Texas won thunderous reelection to position himself for the Republican nomination for president in 2ooo. The worst natural disaster in modern history hit Central America when Hurricane Mitch swept through the region, killing thousands and shattering the economies of Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. 
General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ex-dictator, was arrested in London at the request of a Spanish magistrate, who is seeking to put him on trial for murder, torture and genocide. The general's arrest made legal history, dividing Chileans and provoking protests from their government. 
In Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso comfortably won a second term in an election in October despite, or because of, a financial crisis which threatened to undermine the country's new-found price and currency stability. Six years after staging a bloody but failed military coup in Venezuela, Hugo Chavez won his country's presidency through the ballot box, on a populist platform. The separatist Parti Quebecois retained power in provincial elections in Quebec But a lower share of the vote reduced the prospects of a third referendum on independence. 
Bloody street riots caused Indonesia's President Suharto to step down after 32 years. He was replaced by his protege, BJ. Habibie; unrest soon returned. 
A veteran opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, became president of South Korea and freed 2,300 prisoners. Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, sacked his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, and had him tried for corruption and sexual crimes. Mr Anwar claimed it was all a conspiracy. 
A Hindu-nationalist party, the BJP, formed a new government in India. Soon after, both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and tension in Kashmir grew. John Howard was re-elected in Australia with a mandate to introduce a new goodsand-services tax. 
Pol Pot, leader of the Khmers Rouges, died in Cambodia. Devastating floods in China, Bangladesh and South Korea displaced millions. A tidal wave in Papua New Guinea killed 2,ooo people. 
Little change 
After an i8-month IsraeliPalestinian impasse, Bill Clinton stage-managed an interim deal between Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat at an American summit in October. Mr Clinton then visited Mr Arafat in Gaza. But opposition to the deal in Israel's cabinet led Mr Netanyahu to decide on an early election next May. 
Two crises between Iraq and the UN arms inspectors were resolved just ahead of American bombing raids. A third one, in December, was not, and the Americans and British carried out a four-day air attack. Saddam Hussein said the inspectors would not be allowed back. 
Congolese rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, set out from eastern Congo to overthrow Laurent Kabila. Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia sent troops to protect the president. Peace efforts failed and the war became a stalemate. 
The American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed, killing 250 people, nearly all African. America blamed Osama bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, and bombed his camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceuticals factory in Sudan. 
Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military dictator, died of a heart attack. His successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, released political prisoners and announced elections next February at which new political parties would compete. 
Leftward bent 
By the end of 1998 left-ofcentre parties were in power, usually in coalitions, in 13 out of the European Union's 15 countries. Right-of-centre governments ruled the roost only in Spain and Ireland. 
In Germany Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrats were beaten in a general election by Gerhard Schroder and the Social Democrats, who formed a coalition government with the Greens. 
Politics and the economy in Russia became ever more chaotic. An ailing Boris Yeltsin sacked two prime ministers and said he would stay as president until mid-2000. Voters north and south of the Irish border approved an agreement intended to bring peace to Northern Ireland But rows continued. 
A fragile peace survived in Bosnia, but its people continued to vote for leaders along largely ethnic lines. Civil war broke out in the south Serbian province of Kosovo, where the ethnic-AIbanian majority demanded independence. 
The Greek-Cypriot government of Cyprus decided not to deploy Russian surface-toair missiles, which Turkey had threatened to blitz. The Basque separatist guerrilla group ETA declared peace in Spain.  1999 To the brink 
Global GDP growth fell by half to less than 2% and the world teetered on the edge of the worst financial crisis since the 193os. Russia defaulted on its domestic debts in August; Long-Term Capital Management, a big hedge fund, nearly collapsed. Fears of a global credit crunch were eased only after America's Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times. 
Deflation surfaced. In dollar terms, commodity and oil prices sank to levels not seen since 1986. In real terms, The Economist industrials commodity price index fell to its lowest since the 193os and oil prices to their lowest in 25 years. Even the prices of finished goods fell in several countries, squeezing the average inflation rate in the G7 economies to a 4o-year low. 
As international capital flows dried up, the emerging economies submerged. Much of East Asia plunged into deep recession; Russia's economy imploded; and, by the end of the year, Brazil's economy was shrinking, after $30 billion had been spent defending its currency. Such was the demand for financial rescues that the IMF almost ran out of money; but at the last minute America's Congress approved new funds. 
Japan's economy went from bad to dreadful. By October, it had contracted for four quarters in a row, despite umpteen fiscal-stimulus packages. The Nikkei average tumbled to 12,880 in October, its lowest level for 13 years. 
Most of the other rich economies flourished. America's economy expanded by an estimated 3.5%, driven by falling import prices and rampant consumer spending on the back of stockmarket gains. Wall Street plunged by 20% during the summer, but it then recovered, to leave the Dow up 17% over the year. 
Asian banks wobbled. In Japan, the passage of a Y60 trillion ($500 billion) bank-aid package allowed the government to nationalise LongTerm Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, two of the duffest lenders. The two insolvent banks had assets equal to 7% of Japan's GDP. In China GITIC, a big investment group, collapsed. 
The urge to merge 
It was the world's biggest ever year for mergers and acquisitions: they surpassed $2.4 trillion, 50% above 1997's total. American companies made two-thirds of the deals. Biggest of all in value terms was the union of two oil giants, Exxon and Mobil, announced in December: it will create the world's biggest company in revenue terms. 
About a quarter of deals by volume were cross-border. Daimler-Benz, a German car maker, joined Chrysler in the largest foreign takeover of an American firm. In drugs, parts of the biggest French and German firms, RhonePoulenc and Hoechst, merged; as did Britain's Zeneca with Sweden's Astra. 
Big banks got even bigger. Citicorp joined Travelers in the largest ever financial-services merger. A week later came news of another whopper: the merger of BankAmerica and NationsBank to form America's second biggest bank. Germany's Deutsche Bank paid $io billion for Bankers Trust, America's ninth biggest, which had been driven into loss by the emerging-markets crisis. 
In the digital world, convergence continued Compaq, a hungry Pc-maker, gobbled Digital Equipment Corporation; and America Online, the best-known Internet service provider, paid $4.2 billion for Netscape, populariser of the web-browser. In telecoms, WorldCom merged with MCI, a long-distance company. A re-energised AT&T bought TCI, America's leading cable operator, and linked with Britain's BT. 
Media mergers went transatlantic. Canada's Seagram, which owns Universal Studios, bought PolyGram, Philips's music-and-films arm, for $10.6 billion. In doing so it destroyed the nearest thing Europe had to a film studio. Bertelsmann, Germany's media giant, bought Random House for a rumoured $1.5 billion, thus becoming the world's largest Englishlanguage publisher. 
Europe came closer to having a single stockmarket when the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges decided to trade jointly Europe's top blue-chip shares. Other European exchanges said they were keen to join. 
Sic transit 
Robert Crandall, tough boss of American Airlines for three decades, stepped down. Alex Trotman, boss of Ford (and now a lord), quit earlier than expected. So did Anna Murdoch, who left her husband Rupert and the board of News Corp. 
Pfizer launched Viagra, a cure for impotence, but later had to attach a warning about side-effects. Gillette launched a sharp new razor, but later had to cut jobs. America's tobacco companies fought suits from state governments in court, but then settled their legal rows and took large charges. 
America's Department of Justice launched an epic antitrust case against Microsoft. Whatever the verdict, an appeal is certain, and the case is doubtless destined for the Supreme Court. 
Switzerland's two largest banks, UBs and Credit Suisse, buckled under a mounting pile of class-action suits and agreed to pay Holocaust survivon $1.25 billion. 
Hong Kong and Malaysia opened new airports, among the world's largest, just as the region's economic crisis cut back air travel. Both suffered expensive teething troubles.  1999 The Economist, 25 St James's Street, London swi iec FAx : 0171 839 2968 E-MAIL : [email protected] 
No apology necessary 
SIR-I have never been able to accept what many Japanese opinion makers never tire of telling us to do: to ""apologise"" to the Chinese for ""crimes"" our fathers and grandfathers committed in China (""Japan in the right"", December 5th). Conveniently they forget to tell us that China's communist leadership far outdid the Japanese imperial army in the killing of their people. They did so to stay in power and, in my view, would not hesitate to do so again. 
Also, they do not discuss how the present Japanese army, just 150,000 strong, could become an aggressive threat to our neighhours, China included. Your point that the Chinese leadership, by seeming outraged at the non-apology of Japan's leaders, is putting Japan on the defensive and extracting a financial concession is clear to see. But again, our opinion makers seem not to see such a simple truth. 
Osaka NAOMI HAGA 
SIR-I disagree strongly with your support of Japan in its refusal to apologise to China for colonial atrocities. Your main argument is that China's rulers are a nasty bunch with no right to lecture anyone about abusing the Chinese people. In some cases it can be hard to separate attitudes towards a government from feelings about the people it represents. But surely this is not such a case. The issue pre-dates the governments and indeed governmental systems of both countries, and is one on which the Chinese leaders do speak for many of their people. 
Japan does recognise and deal with the Chinese regime, in no way regarding it as a pariah state incapable of normal relations. So if we say the Chinese get no apology because we dislike their leaders, we might as well say no one anywhere gets recognition of past wrongs unless we like their government. 
Cambridge CHRIS BAMFORD 
Family values 
SIR-Your article on the sale of Icelandic family data (December 5th) clearly summarises the ethical problems. However, some matters need clarifying. Iceland is not inbred: inbreeding occurs when individuals preferentially marry known relatives. The effect is to lose genes, especially rare ones. This makes the remaining genes easier to find but it has little effect on common genes, whose collaborative efforts influence the risk of common disorders. Rather than its depth of ancestral documentation, the value of Iceland in these disorders is that its environment is unusually homogeneous, as are standards of living and standards of medical provision. 
In relatively rare disorders due to single genes, such as cystic fibrosis and the inherited form of breast cancer, deep ancestral studies allow a single common ancestor to be found and the position of genes to be defined through nearby genes. In common disorders many genes are usually involved and these genes may be derived from as many ancestors. 
It is difficult to see how defining more ancestors can provide much information on the common disorders whose decipherment is the main commercial attraction. It was largely the impossibility of making pedigrees both confidential and informative that led the Ethical Committee of the Icelandic Medical Council to state that it was ""completely opposed to the present bill and will advise Icelandic physicians not to participate in the setting up of the data base.""

Santiago RAUL WARD 
In the pipeline 
SIR-Your article on Caspian energy (November 28th) asserts that prospects for building a main export pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan in Turkey have rarely looked so doubtful. In fact, prospects for this project have never looked better. 
In the past, many observers thought a pipeline between Baku and Supsa in Georgia could provide the optimal route for exports from offshore Azerbaijan. But during the past 12 months, companies and regional governments have realised the importance of some broader considerations. These include long-term energy security, the viability of shipping large volumes of oil through the Bosporus, and the attractiveness of a large-diameter pipeline to a port like Ceyhan, which is able to handle exports from both sides of the Caspian. 
The contention that the bulk of output from eastern Caspian producers will flow to a Russian terminal on the Black Sea may be true, but only for a limited time. Significant potential exists for boosting the proven oil reserves of Kazakhstan, both offshore and onshore. If fully realised, these additions could exceed the capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's first- and secondphase pipelines to the Russian Black Sea coast. 
In early December, Kazakhstan and three companiesChevron, Mobil and Shellagreed to study the feasibility of creating a unified system of oil and gas pipelines from western Kazakhstan to Turkey. This will be an important step towards aggregating Caspian output and enhancing the viability of the Ceyhan export route. The Azerbaijan International Operating Company, meanwhile, has said negotiations are continuing with potential transit countries. These developments, plus the likelihood of incentives from regional governments, will ultimately make Baku-Ceyhan the optimal route for Caspian oil exports.

Case for the defence 
SIR-Your special on defence (December 12th) confuses cause and effect. You say that ""the chances of aerial dogfights or naval battles"" are declining and, therefore, large industrial war machines such as ships, submarines and tanks are not worth purchasing. But why are the chances of mechanised land wars, dogfights and sea battles receding? Is it because of a fundamental change in the nature of warfare or because the overwhelming superiority of western militaries makes confrontation impractical? 
It is arguable that there is overinvestment in traditional areas but equally arguable that it is crucial to maintain an overwhelming advantage in these areas, to deter the most destructive forms of warfare. The situation is analogous to the maintenance of a nuclear deterrent to make nuclear attack uneconomical. Tacoma

The Economist, Ill West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019-2211.  1999 WITH every day that passes, matters get worse. The country is drifting along in a state of neglect. Legislative programmes are unheard of. Reformist debate has stopped. The political atmosphere is as poisonous as it has been since the 196os. Iraq is bombed, and half America-as well as much of the worldwonders at the president's motives. When Russia collapses, when markets stumble, when China gets aggressive, when the next terrorist atrocity occurs, the world still hopes America will take the lead. But how can it, when Bill Clinton is about to go on trial before the Senate? 
Everyone wants this horror-and horror is not too strong a word-to end. Had Mr Clinton resigned in August, when he was forced to admit that he had lied to his family, his colleagues and the American people, he could have finished it there. He could still do so; and would do so, if he were capable of shame or had any sense of honour. But Mr Clinton is even less inclined to resign today than he was before his impeachment. The vote to impeach was so partisan that it has rallied even wavering Democrats behind him, and has hitched the polls a few points higher in his favour. Where even the intimation of impeachment shattered Nixon, it has strengthened Bill Clinton. He will cling on to the last. 
How then can the paralysis be broken? At this point, only in two ways. The first would be a quick trial in the Senate which would probably end in acquittal but would not rule out criminal proceedings once Mr Clinton had left office. The second would be a motion of censure: constitutionally doubtful, but not objectionable, as long as it did not include immunity from future prosecution. Two things are vital here. The first is speed, to get America back to work. But more important is the second: that the president should be made to face the consequences of his perjury before the grand jury. He must be made to feel the weight of the damage he has done. 
Penance all round 
To be fair, blame for the damage should also be laid at other doors. America has been so convulsed by this scandal, and the public so revolted, because the process of bringing Mr Clinton to book has been tainted at every stage. The president was dogged by an independent counsel whose powers were excessive and whose tactics were sometimes suspect. The Supreme Court caused much of the paralysis by ruling that the Paula Jones suit against a sitting president should proceed. That suit itself was encouraged by the president's political enemies. The press-including The Economist-leapt into the Monica story with both feet. As a result, although the machinery of impeachment was gleefully cranked up, it soon felt wrong. The sense of shame and sadness that now engulfs many thoughtful Americans comes not so much from sympathy with this particular president-whose lying defiance deserves noneas from worry at the precedents that have been set for political vendettas against elected presidents in future. 
As the newyear dawns, there is some hope that the damage done will not be lasting. In the Senate, at least, there is a desperate urge for civility to undo the grandstanding rudeness shown by Republicans in the House. If the Senate performs its duties with dispatch, and above all with bipartisanship, some of the wounds may start to heal; though it may take months, and even a trouncing in next year's elections, before the Republican zealots in Congress start to grasp the havoc they have caused. 
On a point of detail (though a large one) Congress should review, and consider abolishing in its present form, the office of the independent counsel when the statute comes up for renewal this year. At present, an attorney-general has little choice but to appoint such a counsel when there seems to be evidence of executive-branch wrongdoing. But his brief is open-ended, his funding and his subpoena powers almost limitless. The present statute, a reaction against the powerless prosecutors of the Watergate era, did not envisage a Ken Starr figure let loose on the White House. The office has diminished the importance of Congress (as was seen most clearly in Watergate) in checking the excesses of the president and his men. 
The Supreme Court, too, has not emerged without bruising. As soon as a pretext arises (though America might well hope one would not arise soon), the court should revisit its ruling that sitting presidents are liable to prosecution in civil suits. The justices, like the House Republicans in turn, have sometimes seemed blustered into hardline positions by their distaste for the president's stonewalling. If calmer tempers can prevail, the three main branches of government may be able to deal with each other reasonably again. 
Yet that may take years. Although every arm of government, not merely the president, has behaved in ways they are now beginning to regret, dangerous precedents have been set. The presidency is a weakened and unattractive office, impeachment has become a purely partisan instrument, and marginal groups in Congress will now feel they have the power to overturn the mandate of the people. It is high time everyone drew back, reviewed the damage, and began to restore some of the rules and conventions that have kept America free of such traumas in the past. But the first essential is the brisk, fair and appropriate punishment of the man who, many months ago, might have spared his country all this agony by behaving as an honourable president really should.  1999 Historians may well count January 4th 1999 as an epic moment 
IT WILL happen over a holiday weekend, and in a way which leaves ordinary citizens more or less unaffected, as new notes and coins will not replace old national currencies for a further three years. But the nature of its launch on January 4th should not let anyone underestimate the importance of the creation of the euro, the new single currency for ii European Union members, nor miss its genuinely historic nature. It is the biggest risk the Eu has ever taken, but also an adventure that could transform the economic and political landscape of the continent. It is the first time that countries of anything like this number, size or global economic weight have gathered together to share a currency, and thus to pool their monetary sovereignty. It is arguably the most momentous currency innovation since the establishment of the United States dollar in 1792. 
The superlatives could go on. But is the euro to be welcomed? Yes, it is, and all should hope that it will be a success. The European Union is an imperfect creature, with some of its actions based on fine principles of political economy and some on poor ones. The intentions behind the euro fall clearly into the first category. The EU was founded in 1957 on the desire to avoid war, and many of its best achievements have also been based on another sort of disarmament: policy disarmament. For external trade, for state aids, for the singlemarket rules and others, countries have handed over powers that seemed (though generally weren't) individually desirable but were in practice mutually harmful. A similar transfer is happening now with monetary policy. The ii euro members' rights to inflate, to finance budget deficits by printing money, to boost exports temporarily by currency devaluation are being handed over to the new European Central Bank (ECB) in the most powerful way possible, by treaty. 
As with the other forms of policy disarmament, the transfer of powers to a supra-national body does not guarantee they will be used well. In trade, national protectionism has too often merely been replaced by pan-European protectionism. But the Treaty of Maastricht, which in 1991 paved the way for the ECB and the euro, gives cause for hope. The ECB has a strict and simple task: price stability. It is forbidden by treaty from bailing out a profligate government. Its independence from political interference is well entrenched. 
That said, the risks associated with the euro also begin with the treaty. To paraphrase Keynes's criticisms of the Treaty of Versailles after the first world war, treaties often solve one problem but cause the next. In the case of Maastricht, one risk is that the ECB's task will be carried out too strictly and inflexibly. But the most worrying legacy lies in the treaty's strictures about national budget deficits and in the cementing of those concerns in the later Stability and Growth Pact. As our article argues on pages 19-zz, this deprives governments of the one power which, under a monetary union, they most need: the ability to use national fiscal policy to counteract recessions which affect one member state more than the others. They have not lost this ability altogether, but it will be severely constrained. 
The danger that this raises is that in the event of a sharp recession in one or more countries, there will then be a political reaction against the EU itself The Union as a whole, and other euro members, will be blamed for the victim's inability to moderate its recession. Given that public support for the euro has been thin, to say the least, in most of the member countries (and is unlikely to grow much during the absurdly long, three-year period before people actually get hold of euro notes and coin), this is one helluva hostage to fortune. 
A United States of Europe? 
Such an outcome, if it happens, could cause a political bustup; or it could lead to more power being transferred to the EU in the worst possible circumstances, namely when the Union is deeply unpopular. But there is also a happier way to think about things. Perhaps this nasty outcome will not occur, either because no such ""asymmetric"" recession takes place or because governments, meanwhile, have dismantled the stability pact. In that event, the euro will have proved a success: its members will have achieved low inflation, and the currency will have ridden out the ups and downs of the economic cycle without itself becoming politically unpopular. That is the outcome for which everyone should be hoping during the next decade. 
What then? The answer, most probably, is that a successful euro would give a big impulse to political union between the constituent countries, something close to the founding fathers'-and Winston Churchill's-original dream. The policy disarmament of monetary union would have been shown to have worked, would by then be justifiably popular, and would have encouraged governments to seek new ways to transfer their powers to common institutions. Such a union is not inevitable. And on a decade or two's timetable it would be unlikely to be as full a union as today's United States of America. To those who hate federalism, the very thought of political unity will anyway be anathema. But this would be the right way to arrive at a closer union: after a positive experience, and with popular support. 
Even this Elysian vision must, however, take account of other likely changes. By then the EU will be bigger, with 20-3o members rather than the current 15. That fact, let alone the current division between the ii euro countries and the four, led by Britain, that have not joined, is likely to mean that the Union should become a multi-system entity, with some countries signing up to everything and others opting for a different blend. It may well prove perfectly rational, in the long term, for some EU countries to stay out of even a successful euro. But that, too, is a happy thought: a Europe that is broad as well as deep, that takes account of national differences and is not thought of as a federalising bully. If the euro succeeds in creating such a Europe, its launch on January 4th 1999 will be looked back on as really quite a moment.  1999 Not even Tony Blair can put a positive gloss on the scandal that has just claimed two of his senior ministers 
TONY BLAIR is one of the world's most admired politicians. In Britain, too, his personal popularity has remained unusually high well into the second year of his New Labour administration. But even Mr Blair will find it difficult to emerge unscathed from the scandal that led over Christmas to the abrupt resignation from the cabinet of Peter Mandelson, one of his closest political friends, along with the resignation of Geoffrey Robinson, the paymaster general, who had secretly lent Mr Mandelson 373,ooo ($630,ooo) on easy terms to buy a swanky home in London's Notting Hill. Mr Blair seems genuinely to have been kept in ignorance of this arrangement between his friends. But he has connived in letting Mr Mandelson make light of what he did. 
A letter of resignation is often the last chance politicians have to put a favourable spin on an unfavourable turn of events. If their careers are finished, it does no great harm to let them get away with it. But Mr Blair has told Mr Mandelson that his career is far from over, that he will achieve ""much, much more with us"". To drive the message home, the undisgraced former minister has been consoled by an overnight stay with the Blairs at Chequers. He is to retain various special responsibilities, such as strengthening Britain's relations with Germany. In short, his career is still very much alive. That is why he and Mr Blair cannot be allowed to get away with a truly breathtaking bit of resignation spin. 
To judge by his letter to Mr Blair, Mr Mandelson is a victim of fate, a loyal lieutenant who did nothing seriously wrong in borrowing some money from a friend, but who would sooner fall on his sword than allow the faintest hint of impropriety to taint the high ethical standards which supposedly sets New Labour apart from its Tory predecessor (see page 49). Tojudge byhis letter to Mr Mandelson, Mr Blair sees his former trade and industry secretary as a loyal chum who made a ""misjudgment"" but insisted on doing the honourable thing, paid a heavy price, and so forth. This is not just the usual humbug politicians are expected to spoon out when they get into this sort of fix. It is hypocritical nonsense. 
Far from being a willing martyr, sacrificing a glittering career for a higher cause, Mr Mandelson resigned only after the failure of an energetic attempt to brazen things out, and in the light of further disclosures that he may have been economical with the truth when applying for a mortgage. Above all, it is nonsense to portray Mr Robinson's loan as if it were only something that might look wrong to suspicious minds. It really was wrong-which is why Mr Mandelson strove so hard to keep it secret. 
Consider the sequence of events. Mr Robinson made the loan, on favourable terms, when Labour was in opposition and Mr Mandelson was at the centre of Mr Blair's inner circle. In these circumstances, Mr Mandelson must surely have wondered whether Mr Robinson's generosity was an attempt to buy position in the new government. And yet he said nothing about the loan to Mr Blair. He said nothing after the election, either, when he was made responsible for presenting government policy and Mr Robinson was made paymaster general. He said nothing when Mr Robinson's business affairs later became the stuff of controversy and the subject of scrutiny by Parliament. And, amazingly, he continued to say nothing when, as trade and industry secretary, his own department started an investigation into Mr Robinson's affairs. Not at all holier than thou 
Many people will look at this affair and wonder whether Mr Mandelson's belief that the pursuit of greatness requires a flashy house will set back the modernisers in the Labour Party. That is another story (see Bagehot, page 52). What is already clear is that the party that entered office promising to set higher standards in public life has let itself off far too lightly. Mr Mandelson pretends to see nothing wrong in failing to tell Mr Blair about his personal indebtedness to the beleaguered Mr Robinson. Mr Blair pretends to believe him. As for Mr Robinson himself, Mr Blair says that a blameless minister has been ""hounded out"". But if Mr Robinson is blameless, why did Mr Blair let him go? And if Mr Mandelson had to go, why is he promised a glittering future? It is almost enough to make you nostalgic for John Major.  1999 Taking part, it is said, is just as important as winning. This rule apparently applies as much to economic statistics as to sports 
WHEN a country competes for the first time in the Olympic games or the World Cup, it unleashes a wave of national pride-even if its athletes come last. A less well known mark of national esteem is whether a country is included in The Economists economic indicator pages (see pages 88-90). Our power to delete countries at the mere click of a mouse can, it seems, provoke international disputes. 
Disgruntled government officials and businessmen often demand to know why their country is left out. The answer is simple. New Zealand's economic policies have been more exciting (and more commendable) than Belgium's, but (given our space constraint) the criterion for inclusion in our pages on developed countries is size: Belgium may be uneventful, but its GDP is almost four times that of New Zealand's. 
Some governments wince if their country is listed among the emerging economies. Portuguese officials were cross to see their country in our emerging-markets table. Their yelps, and the fact that Portugal is now part of Europe's single-currency area, persuaded us to move it into the developed world. The unfortunate result is that Portugal has now completely disappeared from our tables. ""Why?"" demands the country's foreign minister. Because although Portugal was important in the emerging-market league (its stockmarket is relatively developed) its economy is too small to include in our league of developed countries for which we publish much more detailed economic statistics. 
Let that be a warning to Greece, which also claims that it is no longer an emerging economy. Better, perhaps, to be a big fish in a pond than a tiddler in an ocean. In the real world, promotion can sometimes lead to an even more serious fate. The IMF promoted South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan from developing to advanced economy status in May 1997-only months before East Asia's financial collapse. 
Behind such disputes lies a deeper issue: the labels given to countries are out-of-date. So ""industrial economies"" are misnamed now that industrial production accounts for only one-quarter of their output-much less than in the emerging economies. And the ""emerging market"" label-itself created to provide a more positive image for the ""third world""-also looks tarnished. It once conjured up the image of dynamic economies and stockmarkets; now, with countries from Thailand, to Russia, to Brazil in deep recession, cynics have renamed them ""submerging"" markets. 
Name dropping 
Four years ago, The Economist suggested a new set of labels for country groupings: the ""paralysed"" (poor economies, such as those in Africa, that have been standing still); the ""progressing"" (emerging markets); and the ""paranoid"" (the rich countries that are terrified of competition from the progressives). But since then many progressives have become paralysed, and some, such as Malaysia, risk becoming paranoid too as they shelter their economies from global forces. 
Perhaps we should group countries according to their chances of gaining entry to our indicator pages: the puny (too small, no hope) the persistent (governments which pen the most letters of complaints and the persuasive (those with good arguments, of course, not frenetic phrases). But the only sure winners will be the patient: economies that expand by following sound policies.  1999 Only poets can now save mankind from millennium buggery 
SCARCELY a year to go, and still no one can be confident that the stroke of midnight next December 31st will not release a plague of little green bugs to usher in the new millennium. Panic is rising. Every household in Britain has been told to stock up with two weeks' supplies, presumably of spam, margarine and vindaloo curry, the national dish. Some people foresee the lights going out all over the world, as power stations crash. Others say aircraft will go demented, along with cars, trains, traffic lights, hospital equipment and the numberless other bits of high-techery that make modern life worth living (all those computer games of Christmas past). Launch-on-warning missiles will be released, nuclear weapons will start spontaneously to fizz and, if any life at all continues, stockmarkets will go into sullen decline, as a bug-induced recession of apocalyptic proportions takes hold. 
Admittedly, the bugs are not going to have it all their own way. A working-group of ""informatics"" experts, known as Y2K chiefs, has just been convened at the United Nations in New York. They have been instructed to ""address the difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experiences."" 
Reassured? Of course not. It is nerds and geeks and informatics experts who got us into this fix in the first place. With the clock ticking, it is no good looking to them to get us out of it. Bring on the people who really get things done-""the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire . . . the unacknowledged legislators of the world."" Yes, Shelley's poets are now the only ones likely to be able to make the world safe for computerised civilisation as we know it. 
And how? Well, by stopping the ticking of the damned clock. Smart-Alicks have come up with their silly ideas, such as telling your computer or microchip that 2ooo is really 1972, the most recent year to have matching dates and days of the week. If it worked, that would buy 28 years in which to solve the problem, or at least address the difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experiences. An alternative would be to say, ""All right, computers, listen up: the calendar has been wrong from the start. Jesus Christ was actually born around 6Bc, so we've really passed the dreaded 2ooo mark and you didn't even notice. It wasn't so bad after all."" Or you could do a Pope Gregory, or at least a variation of his trick, which was to skip the ten days after October 4th 1582 in order to tidy up the Julian calendar, which had been losing a day a century. But whether you go forward or back, you meet this difficulty: why should computers respond any more readily to being fooled about the date than to being told the truth? 
So over to the poets, those unacknowledged legislators of the world and, of course, to those they write about: 
Your face would stop a clock, For it's so passing fair That time itself would like to stop And linger there. 
Forget other proposals, the stopped clock is the only solution to the millennium-bug problem. A pause will do everybody good: the world has been in a dreadful rush for far too long, and in many respects people are really getting ahead of themselves. Properly equipped, the poets can avert something that might be quite unpleasant. Only one thing is missing: the face they need to arrest the ticking. Let the search begin. The world has just 12 months (no little green gremlins need apply.)  1999 Europe's monetary union is neither bound to succeed nor doomed to fail. Leadership, circumstances and luck will combine to decide its fate 
THE architects of the euro, looking back this weekend on what they have achieved, are entitled to feel pleased with themselves. As recently as ten years ago, the idea of merging the European Union's national monetary systems seemed fantastic. A plan for doing it was drawn up nonetheless. Then, with the ink on this blueprint hardly dry, the forerunner of the single currency (the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System) collapsed, casting new doubt on the whole enterprise. No matter. The prime movers, Helmut Kohl in Germany and Francois Mitterrand in France, carried on regardless. On January 4th their remarkable vision becomes a reality: the currencies of the it participating members of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union will be ""irrevocably"" fused. 
To have come this far is in itself an amazing political feat. Nobody can claim that EMU was forced upon Europe's governments by force of events, still less by popular demand. Events have, if anything, conspired to wreck the plan. Europe's voters, perhaps reflecting the weight of official pro-euro propaganda, are by and large in favour, and opinion has moved further in this direction of late (see table i) However, the balance in Germany, which could prove decisive, is still quite narrow. And it is disturbing that so few voters anywhere consider themselves ""well-informed"" about the project. 
This is an initiative of extraordinary ambition, given that it is to be carried through despite quite shallow support in popular opinion. EMU is an elite project. Europe's governments are saying: Our people may not be convinced of the euro's benefits just yet, but once it is in place and they come to understand it, they will change their minds. Europe's leaders had better be right. Otherwise, when the system comes under strain, its political foundations may prove too weak to sustain it. 
Even before construction of the euro is complete, governments can point to one notable success. The past year has seen extraordinary turmoil in global financial markets. Rich-country stockmarkets and currencies have not been spared. Yet Europe has been, comparatively speaking, a safe haven. Intra-European movements in exchange rates have been tiny. This is something that the euro-ii governments had committed themselves to, but their success could not have been taken for granted a year ago. The fact is, at a time of unprecedented financial turbulence, the foreign-exchange markets regarded the promise to stabilise intra-European exchange rates as credible. Currencies have held steady and interest rates have converged: it augurs well for the transition to the new system. 
The next few years are, after all, transitional. National currencies will continue to circulate until the end of zool, albeit at permanently fixed parities. In the meantime, the European System of Central Banks undertakes to defend those parities. In principle this means that if, say, Italians decide to switch all their lire into D-marks, the supply of D-marks will be expanded without limit to accommodate them. Even now there must be some small doubt as to whether, if push comes to shove, this will happen. But if the markets continue to regard the parities as credible-as they did throughout the exceptionally severe test of the past year-then Germany's offer to finance the early retirement of Italy's currency is unlikely to be called upon. 
That danger aside, and for the moment considering EMU only in its economic aspect, two principal risks remain. The first, which will be most acute during the project's early years, is that economic policy in the euro area as a whole will be ill-judged, leading to a recession that discredits the whole venture. The other, which will remain a threat into the medium term, is that the system will prove too inflexible to cope with local (in the jargon, ""asymmetric"") economic shocks. Consider each in turn. 
Independent to a fault 
In designing EMU, the architects laid great emphasis both on the independence of the European Central Bank (ECB) and on the simplicity and severity of its anti-inflation objective. In statutory terms, at least, the ECB may well be the most independent, and most single-minded, central bank in the world. America's Federal Reserve, for instance, is required by law to take output and employment into account alongside inflation, for which no numerical target is set. In addition, the Fed is accountable to Congress, which periodically questions its top officials and sometimes tries to influence their views. The restraint that Congress and the White House show in this regard is a matter of custom, reflecting the standing which the Fed has won for itself in financial markets over many years, and not a matter of law. 
The position of the ECB is quite different. The Maastricht treaty allows for no clear accountability to any other arm of national or European government. In fact the treaty explicitly forbids the ECB and its decision-making bodies to ""seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a member state or from any other body"". It also stipulates that the proceedings of the ECB council's meetings will remain confidential. If he chose, Wim Duisenberg, the first chief of the ECB, could nonetheless announce the outcome of its deliberations, together with a commentary and forecasts justifying it. Mr Duisenberg says he is not against this sort of openness. Time will tell. The point is, everything is left for the ECB to decide: this is independence with a vengeance. 
As to aims, the treaty further stipulates that the ECB'S goal is ""price stability"", leaving the bank to decide what that means. In many other countries with ""independent"" central banks-in Britain, for instance-the government sets a target for inflation and reserves the right to change it as circumstances, in its judgment, dictate. EMU has no such escape-clause. Moreover, the bank is forbidden to balance the goal of price stability against other aims. The treaty directs the ECB to ""support the general economic policies of the Community"" but, crucially, it is to do this ""without prejudice to the objective of price stability"". 
The ECB has now defined ""price stability"" to mean inflation of less than 2% a year. In modern times, no major economy has hit such a target consistently over a run of years. America's inflation rate has averaged 3.3% over the past ten years; Germany's, despite the mighty Bundesbank, has averaged 2.8%. In short, a radically undemocratic institution has been charged to achieve, without compromise, an exceptionally demanding goal of virtually zero inflation. 
Strong evidence suggests that centralbank independence is indeed a good idea: any given level of inflation can be achieved more cheaply, in terms of forgone output and employment, if firms and workers believe that monetary policy is free from undue political pressure. The danger is that En,cu'S architects have gone too far. The European Union, with its weak parliament, is acknowledged in any case to have a ""democratic deficit"" at its centre; the powers of the new central bank will make that deficit all the greater. In economic terms, the danger is simply that the ECB will take its instructions literally-and will try to screw inflation down to nothing regardless of wider economic repercussions. 
As it happens, the circumstances seem likely to prove favourable. Forecasters at the OECD expect that output in the euro zone will grow by 212% in the coming year, with inflation remaining at about its present 12% (see table 2). This assumes that short-term interest rates in the euro area will average 3% in 1999, their current level, a full percentage point lower than the average for 1998. All that would presumably suit the ECB pretty well. But more awkward eventualities cannot be ruled out. 
One is that governments, after years of post-Maastricht squeezing and fudging of budget deficits, will ease fiscal policy too much (despite the rule forbidding it, of which more in a moment). That could put upward pressure on inflation and lead the ECB, with little headroom beneath its inflation target, to assert itself at once and raise interest rates (or delay cutting them). An early conflict of this kind between loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy would be an extremely discouraging start. 
Another even more awkward possibility for monetary policy in EMu'S first year or two is that the OECD'S forecasts for output may prove too optimistic. This is not implausible. The health of the world economy is far from robust. With Wall Street overvalued on every historical measure, the danger of sharp falls in global equity prices in 1999 needs to be taken seriously. That in turn might prompt a worse slowdown in demand than is allowed for in the OECD's central-case forecasts. The question would then be whether the ECB would cut interest rates soon enough and far enough to avoid recession in Europe. 
If the bank waited for inflation to fall before acting, that would be too late. Yet the bank might be reluctant to act more promptly, responding to forecasts of lower inflation rather than to out-turns, as it should, for fear of undermining its credibility with the markets. 
Mr Duisenberg will prefer to err on the side of caution (that is, on the side of lower inflation and higher short-term unemployment) in any case; he will want to be judged by the euro zone's inflation record, maintaining that unemployment is none of his concern. Adding to his desire to establish a tough reputation at the outset will be his memory of the fiasco surrounding his appointment. France wanted to appoint its own candidate to the job; the other countries resisted. The absurd compromise that was settled upon allowed France to say that Mr Duisenberg will step down early in favour of its man, while Mr Duisenberg says that no such promise was made. When Mr Duisenberg comes to be tested, the price of that squabble may well be higher interest rates and fewer jobs. 
A shocking possibility 
In principle, however, a recession that threatens the euro-ii as a group is not the most difficult scenario for the ECB. Once its reputation is established and any teething troubles overcome, a system-wide problem of that kind can be dealt with perfectly well by the system-wide response of a change in interest rates. Indeed, a single central bank is arguably better equipped to deal with such a case than would be ii separate national banks, acting in an unco-ordinated way. That is why, beyond the transitional period, the larger challenge for the new system will be to deal with fluctuations that are not system-wide. 
The euro zone is not what economists call an ""optimum currency area""-that is, it is not a region whose constituent parts are affected in broadly the same way by typical economic disturbances, or among whose constituent parts labour moves freely. If it were, then no economic purpose would be served by retaining sub-European currencies. Admittedly, few if any national economies meet that ideal standard: regions within the United States often suffer asymmetric shocks because of local concentrations of particular industries, and although American labour migrates comparatively smoothly from one state to another, these shifts are by no means costless. 
The point, though, is that the euro zone is very much further from being an optimum currency area than is the United States. Disparities in relative prices (after allowing for exchange-rate fluctuations) are greater among the euro-ii than among American states; and the mobility of labour within Europe is, according to one study, only one-third of the mobility of labour within America. 
Advocates of monetary union argue that the euro will itself narrow the gap, by encouraging closer economic integration. This is quite true. However, even with the euro, the barriers of culture and language are likely to remain stronger in Europe. One perverse consequence of the euro may be that, precisely because it encourages closer integration, it will also promote greater local specialisation-increasing the chance of asymmetric shocks from that source. In sum, for many years to come, persistent national divergences in growth and unemployment are likely to recur from time to time. 
Europe's governments all acknowledge that one way to reduce the costs of these divergences is to improve the supply-side flexibility of their economies. The price of European over-regulation is a both a higher unemployment rate over time, and a greater susceptibility to a further upward ratcheting of this average or equilibrium rate of unemployment with each serious recession. The trouble is, governments have so far proved better at paying lip-service to the need for deregulation than they have at dealing with the problem. The recent shift to the left in European politics makes this remedy all the less likely to be adopted. 
That leaves macroeconomic policy. When a country with its own currency suffers a recession, it is free to cut interest rates. This stimulates demand twice over: first by lowering the cost of credit, and second by causing the currency to depreciate (which spurs exports). Countries in the euro zone will not have this option. Emigration cannot help much (as it would in the case of Michigan, say). And since Europe has only a tiny central budget, net assistance from faster-growing countries (in the form of bigget inflows of public spending and smaller outflows of taxes) will also play a far smaller part than the equivalent fiscal transactions in the United States. 
All that remains is national fiscal policy. The recession-struck economy is still free to borrow on its own behalf, thus stimulating demand and speeding its recovery. Or it would be, except for EMU'S ""Stability and Growth Pact"". This is a rule that governments agreed to at Germany's insistence, requiring budget deficits to be held to 3% of GDP or less. Violators will be fined, subject to a vote of governments, unless output has fallen by 2% or more in the year in question. 
Despite this purported flexibility, the regime (like the rules defining the ECB's aims and freedoms) is exceptionally severe. Falls in output of 2% or more are extremely unusual; far smaller downturns would cause unemployment to rise quickly and be universally regarded as ""recessions"". And the restriction is too tight in another way: governments that tried to anticipate a downturn by relaxing fiscal policy early, thereby breaching the 3% limit before output fell by 2%, would also face fines. The German doubts that led to the adoption of this procedure were exaggerated, albeit not entirely groundless. The concern was that chronic overborrowers would become even more fiscally irresponsible once they had adopted the euro, because they would no longer face the financial-market sanction of higher interest rates and (in the end) a depreciating currency. Moreover, this overborrowing would henceforth be at least partly at the expense of Germany and the other euro countries, because they would bear some of the cost of default, if it came to that. 
The fear is exaggerated because the Maastricht treaty rightly insists that the central bank cannot bail out national governments. Provided that promise is believed, and so long as the no-bail-out rule applies to other finance ministries as well as to the ECB, the markets would attach a risk premium (in the form of a higher interest rate) to borrowing by heavily indebted governments. That is as it should be-and no further discipline should be necessary. As it is, the stability pact calls that promise into doubt, by making budgets a collective responsibility. Worse, in the meantime it rules out counter-cyclical fiscal policy of the sort that will often be necessary, and for which there is no longer any plausible national substitute. 
The crucial question regarding the stability pact, therefore, is the same as for the ECB: given that the design is so bad, how might it work in practice? Today, budget deficits in many euro economies (including the three biggest) stand at more than 2% of GDP (see table 3). If demand in Europe grows more slowly in 1999 than the forecasters expect, those deficits may rise. (In some cases they will tend to rise regardless, as assorted post-Maastricht fudges are unwound.) Governments may soon be faced with the stability-pact requirement to raise taxes and/or cut public spending-even as their economies slide toward recession. Again, therefore, the hope must be that the rules will be bent, or scrapped. If this does not happen, and one or more countries encounter a downturn that the ECB cannot remedy by means of system-wide monetary policy, there are only two alternatives. 
One is that the countries concerned endure a deeper and longer recession than they are used to, or is necessary. This plainly runs the risk of calling forth mounting protests against EMU itself The other is that the fiscal powers available to the centre-the money gathered and spent by Brusselsmust be greatly enlarged. This would allow automatic fiscal stabilisers to work within Europe as they do within the United States of America. Many in Europe would regard this second alternative as desirable in any case, which (if the stability pact survives) makes it the more probable outcome. In any event, this seems likely to be the issue on which Europe's political future turns. 
Ever closer union 
Judged strictly as an economic venture, EMU will be a success if, over the coming years, the participating countries benefit from closer integration (measured by growing trade and investment in the euro area), satisfactory growth, declining unemployment and low inflation. If the single-currency project had been better designed, the chances of achieving this would have been good. Closer economic integration seems assured in any case. A plan that created a properly directed, properly accountable central bank and provided for adequate freedom in national fiscal policy would have done as much as macroeconomic policy can do to take care of the rest. To be sure, that would still have left governments to carry a heavy burden of supply-side reform-without which Europe cannot expect to cut its unemployment to the levels seen in America. Still, the outlook would have been promising. 
As it is, the chances of success are no better than fair. The central bank will have to rise above its flawed design-winning the popular regard it will one day need both by explaining what it is up to, and by balancing the short-term demands of low inflation, on the one hand, and growth in output and employment, on the other, more intelligently than its statutes require. And governments will have to find a way to make fiscal policy respond far more flexibly to economic circumstances than the Maastricht rules allow. 
Ideally this will be done by changing the rules-perhaps to require that budgets are balanced over the course of the economic cycle, but leaving them free to run further into deficit at times of slowing demand than the 3% of GDP allowed by the stability pact. Needless to say, in this case too, efforts to liberalise Europe's markets for goods, services and labour far more determined than governments have made so far will also be required. 
If EMU can overcome the flaws of its design and prove an economic success after all, Europe's governments (and, preferably, their citizens as well) will be able to weigh the coming political choices on their merits. If it fails in economic terms, those political choices may be severely constrainedand, as a result, far more divisive. Closer political integration built on the solid foundation of an EMU that worked would be one thing. The same course adopted in distress to save EMU from failure, or even outright collapse, would be an entirely different, and much more dangerous, enterprise.  1999 PERHAPS the biggest omission in the Maastricht treaty was the failure to clarify the status of the ""outs""-the countries that decline to take part. (Britain, Denmark and Sweden have chosen to stay out; Greece would love to join but is nowhere near satisfying the Maastricht criteria for membership.) This was not an oversight but a deliberate gap, much in accord with the way Europe's architects have tended to proceed. 
The EU'S members are pledged to move towards ""ever closer union"". Implicitly, the idea is that they will approach this goal (as yet undefined) at about the same speed-so the four countries not taking part in Emu at the outset are expected to join as soon as they can. To have designed a durable relationship between the ins and outs might have encouraged further delay. 
It often happens in European politics that if you do not want a contingency to arise, you ignore it, hoping it goes away. Sometimes it does-and this time-honoured approach may also work in the case of EMU'S outs. If monetary union is a success, the qualifying outsiders will warm to the idea. But the collapse of the ERM in 1992-93 showed that the head-in-the-sand method is not infallible. If EMU works badly, outsiders such as Britain are likely to become even more reluctant. 
There is also the question of EU enlargement. Prospective new members in Eastern Europe may not be ready, or may not choose, to join EMu at the beginning. Indeed, they would be wise to be cautious. Their economies are still struggling with the legacy of socialism. For many years yet they are likely to remain structurally different from their western neighbours, leaving them more exposed to the danger of asymmetric economic shocks. This only adds to the case for lasting arrangements allowing Eu countries to opt out of EMU indefinitely. 
The main economic problem posed by a permanent division of the EU into EMU and non-EMu countries is that the outs will be seen by the others as cheats. It is easy to imagine circumstances in which the euro will strengthen against other European currencies, putting euro countries at a competitive disadvantage in trade. If this happens (as well it might) at a time of slowing growth in the euro zone and briskly expanding output elsewhere in the EU, the euro-zone governments will be obliged to object. 
In due course, therefore, some form of monetary co-operation"" will probably be required of the outs, if only as a mark of good faith. One possibility would be a revived ERM, albeit a looser arrangement than the one that collapsed. (For instance, governments might promise to limit variations in their real, as opposed to nominal, exchange rates: this would preserve a measure of monetary discretion while ensuring that governments did not use it to pursue a policy of competitive devaluation.) Failing some such accord, the discussion may move to other ways of correcting the ""unfair"" advantage of the noneuro countries' depreciated currenciesand that is a discussion that could endanger the EU itself 
A permanent union of ins and outs would also raise a host of day-to-day political difficulties. The outs' great fearand what eventually may force them into EMU-is that the centre of decision-making for the EU as a whole will move to the committee of euro-zone finance ministers. This seems certain to happen if EMU runs into trouble, and the euro-zone countries adopt remedies such as collective fiscal policy and/or increased harmonisation of taxes and economic regulations. Even if all goes well, though, a diminution of the outs' political sway seems likely. The ins will surely want to punish the outs, with or without a show of regret. How better to encourage the laggards to change their minds?  1999 Europe's single currency is here, and out goes the ecu. The euro will operate in tandem with local currencies in ii EU countries (four don't want to know), and the new European Central Bank will begin to flex its muscles-but national central banks will still play their parts. Germany takes on the rotating presidencies of not only the European Council and the Western European Union but also the Group of Seven, and New Zealand takes the chair of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum.

Compiled with help from Future Events News Service, London. http://www.hubcom.com/fens Tel: +44(o)181 672 3191  1999 THE accused has a seemingly simple choice: to fight it out, or to accept his punishment. But is anything in the world of Bill Clinton, the only elected president in America's history to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, truly straightforward? The president's advisers study every nuance of the opinion polls; his lawyers, like grandmasters with a chess board, plot the consequences of this admission or that; fellow Democrats cringe at his sexual shenanigans, but bask in the glow of his impeachment-defying popularity. Meanwhile, the country prays for an end to the saga. 
At some point the Senate will oblige. Just when is still an open question. The momentum that led to the president's impeachment on December 19th remains remorseless. When the new House meets on January 6th, it must first confirm in office Henry Hyde and the 12 other Republican members chosen to manage Mr Clinton's trial before the Senate. When these worthies present themselves and the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate must meet at 1 pm the next day to consider them. Assume that no witnesses are called, and in theory Bill Clinton's (and the country's) ordeal will be over in a matter of days. 
Maybe so. This week the Republican leader of the Senate, Trent Lott, siad he and Tom Daschle, the Democrats' leader, were agreed that there is no need to hear witnesses. Mr Lott's argument is that ""the record is there to be reviewed, read, presented"" in any way the House prosecutors choose, ""and I think that would be sufficient."" Follow Mr Lott's schedule, and the articles of impeachment will be read in the Senate on January 7th; the trial will begin the following Monday, January ith, and last ""a week or two"". 
Will practice be quite so neat? Perhaps not. After all, most of the House Republicans are gung-ho to see the president squirm; their managers are said to be preparing themselves in the ""expectation"" that witnesses will be called; and in the end many senators may not want to snub the House quite so obviously. 
Moreover, if Mr Clinton chooses to fight, Mr Lott's schedule looks otherworldly. True, the president's team seem to have dropped the idea of a time-consuming challenge against the legality of the incoming House being bound by the decisions of its predecessor. But to accept the trial and plead innocence could likewise exhaust the calendar and the nation's patience: the president could reasonably ask the Senate to grant him time to prepare his defence, and this defence-and Henry Hyde's prosecution-would surely involve the calling of witnesses. 
But what if Mr Clinton does not fight? The president may have struck a defiant tone immediately after his impeachment, but he also talked of ""a reasonable, bipartisan, and proportionate response"" that could be ""embraced in the Senate"" as a ""constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner"". In other words, the president, having expressed contrition ad nauseam, is willing to accept the public censure of Congress, a solution advocated in various forms over the months by senior members of both parties. 
The attractions of censure are many. For Democrats, it provides an escape from the embarrassment of a trial. For Republicans, given the arithmetic of the Senate, it offers a measure of retribution that a trial would in the end deny (a guilty verdict would need the approval of 67 of the loo senators, an unlikely outcome given that the Senate has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats). 
But censure on whose terms? Robert Byrd, the Senate's senior Democrat and its leading historian, is adamant that-censure or no censure-a trial must be started. It is commonly agreed that it could be ended at any point on a vote by 51 senators, and the Senate could then vote to censure. Indeed, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democratic senator from New York, suggests a subtle refinement: let the continuation of the trial be kept in reserve, ready to be invoked if Mr Clinton suddenly decides not to play ball on censure-and let Mr Clinton give censure the force of law, by signing a censure bill sent to him by both House and Senate. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, believes the Senate has a duty to carry a trial to its end and only then, assuming neither article of impeachment garners the support of 67 senators, do ""you sit down and you negotiate the censure alternative."" 
All of which is probably more easily said than achieved. The Republicans and a great many Democrats are adamant that the president must admit that he committed perjury, lying under oath to a grandjury. The president is so far unwilling to admit anything of the sort, mostly for fear of legal consequences (the talk persists of indictments awaiting both him and the First I adv once he has left the White House). From the president's perspective, censure must surely be accompanied by a binding forgiveness, however reluctantly given. 
Is such a bargain impossible? For some idealists, perhaps. But Mr Clinton may well assume that Congress has at least as many pragmatists and that they, like him, can read opinion polls that show his ratings rising as the Republican Party's fall. Meanwhile, it does no harm to gently remind voters and Congress alike that his state-ofthe-union message is due on January 19th; and that, despite Kenneth Starr and the impeachment votes in the House, the state is still looking pretty good.  1999 THE accused has a seemingly simple choice: to fight it out, or to accept his punishment.

IN A sealed room in sprawling Camp Pendleton, a Marine Corps base in California, a young corporal is mastering the use of the most formidable weapon in his arsenal: his brain. A CD-RoM-based simulator takes him through a variety of crises in which he must make split-second decisions and issue instant orders to cope with anything from a sudden burst of enemy gunfire to the approach of a band of thirsty refugees or a roving CNN crew. 
The Camp Pendleton programme is one example of how America is changing the way it trains its armed forces, so that they can handle a post-cold-war world in which charging tank divisions are less common than the chaos of ""low-intensity conflicts"", the jargon for peace-making and peace-enforcement operations. In this new world, the decisions taken by a lg-year-old crouching behind a bush with his finger on the trigger of an M-16 rifle or a laser-aimed missile can have enormous consequences for the foreign policy of the West. 
The Marine Corps, smaller in size and less bureaucratic than its larger cousins of the army, the navy and the air force, is help ing to shape these new training techniques. The 12-day, still-experimental course, of which the CD-ROM simulator is one component, aims to give the young leaders of 12-man sections the decision-making skills and killing authority previously reserved for company or even battalion commanders. Some of the things the marines learn, such as how to stay under cover, are standard military fare. Others, including the counselling skills taught by psychologists, seem to come straight from the world of New Age management gurus; but the young section leaders seem to relish it. 
One aim of the new training system is to enable American soldiers of the 21st century to handle the ""three-block war"". The phrase describes an operation in which they would simultaneously be distributing food and medicine to frantic civilians in one part of a city, quelling rioters and maintaining order in another, and fighting guerrillas in a third. 
Americans have already seen variations of the three-block war in Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Memories of the ill-fated rescue operation in Somalia in 1993 still haunt the military planners, especially the ""Ranger ambush"" in which a combined force of Rangers and Delta Force commandos was trapped by Somali gunmen for 18 hours; 18 men were killed and 73 wounded. Although the marines were not involved in that debacle, it is with an eye on the lessons of Somalia that the corps is now putting new emphasis on urban-warfare tactics and the need for first-class leadership of small units. 
The new training goes hand-in-hand with the use of new military instruments, such as the ""non-lethal munitions"" that will help to give American troops a wider range of options when dealing with an adversary than just trying to kill him. At one demonstration held for Camp Pendleton's senior officers, the arsenal of weapons on show included bean-bag projectiles fired from shotguns and grenade-launchers, blinding pepper sprayed from devices the size of fire-extinguishers, ultra-powerful flashlights that can find and dazzle potential snipers, and grenades which explode into a mess of adhesive foam that can block a doorway or goo up a suspected guerrilla. 
But what Americans peering into the future of warfare call the Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, also employs sterner weapons than these. In future wars of the Bosnia sort, for instance, small numbers of highly trained men with sophisticated weapons under their control will be ableit is hoped-to defeat much bigger armies of the conventional sort with little or no loss to themselves. Hidden on a hillside miles from the enemy, their fingers on precision-aiming devices, and helped by eyein-the-sky satellites and reconnaissance aircraft, they will be able to steer long-range missiles on to the enemy's tanks or guns; and the enemy will not be able to fire back, because he cannot see them and, even if he could, they are probably out of range. 
In such a fight, the weapons used by the warriors of the RMA will by no means be confined to bean-bags and gluey foam. A look at the equipment on display in Camp Pendleton makes the point. Most of them have two barrels and two triggers: one for firing non-lethal projectiles, the other for delivering the old-fashioned, deadly kind. A switch of the trigger and the kinder, gentler marines of the 21st century instantly become lethal. The advocates of the xn,tR are determined to make sure that America and its allies remain ahead of the rest of the world not only in the military technology they possess but also in the skills needed to use these weapons. 
And what happens when an adversary manages to manufacture, buy or steal a collection of similar weapons, as he doubtless will? Why, by then, say the confident optimists of the RA, America and its trusted allies will be deploying even newer devices that can be fired with equal accuracy from still farther away. 
Some American officers, especially older ones, have their misgivings. They say that a system of war built upon a wish to destroy the enemy without yourself suffering any significant number of casualties is inherently dangerous. Remember that 1993 disaster in Somalia. New kinds of weapons, instructed by satellites and computers, may be able to win future firefights of this sort more swiftly and at less cost to your own men; but the men will still need to be there, to occupy some vital hilltop or essential building, and they will have to be prepared to take the consequences. 
In the end, your soldiers must face the risk of being wounded or killed. Clever and brave guerrillas, fighting in places where they are hard to detect-forests or mountains or city side-streets-have to be pursued by soldiers who are not only expertly trained for such warfare but are also willing to engage the enemy at close quarters. Any adversary, when defeated, leaves behind a region which has to be occupied by your own side, to make sure he does not start the war all over again; and your occupying force is bound to suffer casualties. 
An army that believes it can avoid standing in harm's way is, say the sceptics, liable to prove perilously fragile. The coming century is going to provide plenty of crises in which deadly force, working in both directions, cannot be avoided.  1999 NATURE abhors a vacuum. So do American entrepreneurs. Consider a firm called Autopsy/Post Services (1-800-AUTOPSY), founded in 1988 by Vidal Herrera. The frequency with which autopsies are performed in America has been falling steadily for over three decades, and Mr Herrera has made his mark by leaping in to fill the void. 
Mr Herrera charges $2,000 for a complete autopsy, more if the body has been exhumed or if extra tests are ordered. Many of his customers suspect foul play or malpractice. Others have medical questions that a hospital or insurance company would not pay to have answered. Mr Herrera expects to perform roughly 800 autopsies this year; he has turned away thousands of others across the United States, and in other countries, because he could not handle them from his Los Angeles base. That problem will soon be over; in January, Autopsy/Post Services will begin selling franchises in 72 American cities and 16 countries. 
The success of 1-800-AuTOPSY aside, public-health experts are alarmed by the falling number of conventional autopsies. In 196o, roughly one in two deaths in Chicago area hospitals was followed up with an autopsy; that rate is now about one in ten. Federal data collected since 1972 show the same trend. Indeed, experts note that autopsy rates are falling around the world. 
Autopsies can be used to determine the effectiveness of surgical procedures and drug treatments. They provide accurate vital statistics, teach medical students, uncover new diseases and spot old ones that may be spreading. All the while, they sniff out incompetent medical care and the odd murder that might have passed for a slip in the bathtub. George Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (AMA), points out that medical conditions such as toxic shock syndrome and congenital heart disease (as well as many others) were discovered by autopsy. Toxic shock has now been pretty much stamped out; congenital heart disease can be treated successfully with surgery. 
An autopsy is perhaps the onlyway for the dead to speak to the living. Why are Americans listening less? One reason is cost. An autopsy can run up a bill from several hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the methodology. In the days before the health-care system began slimming down, most insurance policies covered the procedure. If not, hospitals politely picked up the tab. No longer. As Hmos, insurance companies and hospitals struggle to distribute scarce resources, they tend to favour the living over the dead. (State and local governments have the right to demand an autopsy in any case where foul play is suspected or the cause of death is unknown.) 
Autopsy, like organ donation, is a difficult subject to broach with grieving families (though the public good associated with both can help the grieving process The attending physician is the logical person to suggest a post-mortem exam; yet all too often a doctor's primary concern is covering his own gluteus maximus. An autopsy may prove a doctor wrong, or even negligent. 
Doctors with better intentions may simply believe that more sophisticated laboratory tests and imaging technology have made the autopsy redundant. Alas, they have not. A study by researchers at Louisiana State University Medical Centre used autopsies to determine that doctors missed 44% of cancerous tumours while patients were alive. Another study at the University of Pittsburgh found a 45% discordance between what clinical doctors diagnosed as the cause of death and what an autopsy later showed it to be. 
In 1988, the JAMA ran an issue round the theme: ""Declaring war on the non-autopsy"". So far, it has been more of a slow retreat. Last month, the Journal took up the torch once again. An editorial proposed a minimum autopsy rate as a condition for hospital accreditation and/or Medicare reimbursement. Meanwhile Mr Herrera, looking ahead to a bulge of dying babyboomers, foresees endless opportunities.  1999 ON AUGUST 15th, Timothy Boomer fell out of his canoe. Naturally, he cursed, using ""loudly and repeatedly . . . a most offensive vulgarity"" together with ""various derivatives"". He was in the middle of nowhere at the time, in a wilderness area of the Rifle River near the Jack Pine Trail in Michigan. Imagine his surprise, therefore, when a deputy sheriff from Arenac County promptly issued him with a ticket for swearing. 
Mr Boomer had failed to note that besides the sheriff, Kenneth Socia, and his buddies sitting on the bank, there were also a woman and two children enjoying the rustic scene within earshot of his oaths. He had therefore infringed a Michigan obscene-speech law, more than a century old, which reads: 
Sec. 337: Indecent, etc, language in presence of women-Any person who shall use any indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language in the presence or hearing of any woman or child shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. 
And being guilty of a misdemeanour, he faces a 90-day jail term or a $100 fine if convicted. Mr Boomer argued for dismissal of the charges, but failed, and now he is about to stand trial. 
The American Civil Liberties Union has leapt in to support him. It argues that cursing is a form of free speech, and that what was unacceptable to delicate 19thcentury ears is now commonplace; so commonplace that, Mr Boomer argues, the four women canoeing with him didn't turn a hair. The prosecutors are less forgiving. Cursing, they say, does not express an idea or a thought. What? Not even the thought that Hell! This water's cold!? Or Damn! The girls are watching!?  1999 THE scholar warms almost instantly to his theme: ""We have been so stable, apart from the Civil War, that we think it natural. Britain and the us are the only countries since 18oo not to have had their form of government changed by violence. You take stability as a given, when in fact it's a rarity."" In other words, let the Senate be wary when it sets about the trial of Bill Clinton. 
It is a good point, seldom heard in the impeachment blather that has filled America's airwaves for the past year. But the scholar is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democratic senator for New York, and perhaps his voice, his manner, his lateral leaps of creative reasoning are a shade too eccentric to make him a talk-show regular. True, he has made more than two dozen appearances on NBC's ""Meet the Press""-but over 31 years. Most recently, just after Christmas, he managed to quote off-the-cuff not just from Shakespeare's ""Troilus and Cressida"" (""Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery: nothing else holds fashion"") but also from Dr Johnson. These are not the sound-bites of normal television. 
But Mr Moynihan is not a normal politician. Michael Barone, one of America's finest political pundits, describes him as ""the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson."" Of the thinking, there is no doubt. Most senators stuff their offices with photos of themselves meeting other important people. This senator stuffs his with books-not just his own (18 at the latest count) but also the Encyclopaedia Judaica, the International Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, bound volumes of the Public Interest, back issues of Political Science Quarterly, and so on. On the mantlepiece is a lunch invitation from the Maharajah of Jodhpur(Mr Moynihan is, after all, a former ambassador to India, as well as to the UN). In short, the office is a don's delight, and Mr Moynihan-large sherry glass in hand, jaunty bow-tie not quite matching the breast-pocket handkerchief-suits it perfectly. 
But what of the politics? In the age of the professional politician, can the Barone superlative really fit a man whose working life has been spent flitting back and forth between academia (Tufts, Harvard, Oxford, the London School of Economics) and public service (posts under Presidents Kennedy,Johnson, Nixon and Ford)? Is Mr Moynihan not just a clever, witty Jack-of-alltrades, with all that the cliche implies? 
Actually, no. One simple reason is that the best politicians are those who get re-elected, and Mr Moynihan, even though he ""hates"" raising campaign money and presses to reform the system, is now in his fourth term in the Senate. They are also those who get things done, which in Mr Moynihan's case means not just some solid environmental and social legislation but also what is now known as ""Ice-Tea"", the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which-not by coincidence-has channelled billions of dollars of public spending to New York's road and rail systems. 
But the best justification for the Barone superlative is that, despite appearances, there is an unbroken thread running through the Moynihan career: an interest in governance. The senator is a policy wonk with the political skills, regularly applied across party lines, to put ideas into practice. Witness his far-sighted study of 1965, ""The Negro Family"", in which he emphasised the connection between fatherless families and increased welfare rolls. Although it was largely ignored at the time, that study led to the 1988 Welfare Reform Act, which for the first time recognised a father's duty to support his children (and a mother's responsibility to find a job). 
What, then, does he think of the 1996 ""welfare-to-work"" reforms, which limit federal handouts to a lifetime total of five years? Not a lot, is the short answer: no one knows what will happen when people fall off the ""five-year cliff"". Perhaps his fears of social distress-he points out that 97% of births to teenage mothers in Washington, Dc, are out of wedlock-will prove groundless. But perhaps not. After all, the reason the eccentric Mr Moynihan is so respected is that he has so often been right. He was, for example, the first to mock CIA assessments of the strength of the Soviet Union, arguing that it was bound to disintegrate under the pressure of its ethnic differences. He was possibly the first to apply epidemiological theory to drugs policy (noting that their illegality promotes crime, he coined the phrase ""iatrogenic government"", comparing government to a doctor whose intrusion only makes a patient worse). And he was an early critic of the Clintons' abortive 1993 effort to reform health care, arguing that with five out of six Americans covered by health insurance, and with free or subsidised care provided for the poor and elderly, the true crisis was not in the health system but the welfare system. 
So is he right in his warnings about impeachment? Is it true, as he told ""Meet the Press"", that ""we could so easily mutate into a president of the month"", with a congressional majority ""routinely removing presidents"" and House speakers therefore becoming presidents? He admits the prospect is hard to imagine, but it is still wise to assure institutional stability. The voice rises in volume and, with an exaggerated roll of the ""r"", the senator points out that the founding fathers talked of ""treason"" as a reason to remove a president from office, not the sins of Mr Clinton. 
But it is getting late; the tutorial must end; the second tumbler of sherry must be regretfully declined. Outside, Pennsylvania Avenue-beautified at the senator's initiative-is almost deserted. What a pity, thinks the student, that the professor, risen from a fatherless childhood in New York's Hell's Kitchen to become a seemingly permanent star of the Senate, should be intent on retiring in 2000. Mr Moynihan roars with laughter: ""Good God, man. It's my teeth, my lower back, and it was understood with my wife at the last election that I wouldn't stand again."" But what a pity, all the same.  1999 Forty years of revolutionary fervour have left Cuba's economy in ruins and its future uncertain. But Fidel Castro remains unchallenged 
ON JANUARY 1st, Cubans celebrated not only the beginning of 1999, but the 40th anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution. There does not seem much to celebrate. The economy is in a mess. Corruption is rife. Prostitution is rampant. Despite police or neighbourhood watchdogs on every street corner, crime is rising. The country's infrastructure is crumbling. The grand promises of the past 40 years are in tatters. In some ways, Cuba seems worse off in 1999 than it was in 1959. And yet, curiously, the chief author of these misfortunes, Mr Castro himself, still retains a place in the heart of most Cubans. 
Mr Castro claims he has no power, only great authority. This is bogus. Outspoken critics end up in jail or exile. And yet Fidelas he is almost universally known-is not loathed as are most other dictators. There are no statues to him, no buildings named after him, no Saddam-style posters. Instead, Fidel's monuments are six-hour speeches and television and radio coverage of his every public word, thought and deed. Most Cubans are inured to this constant stream of bombast, tolerating it with a shrug. Many feel affection for the man who has stood up for so long to the United States. In the countryside, he is even loved by some, especially by older Cubans, despite their country's impoverishment, which can at least be partly blamed on the Yanqui blockade. 
Most people know that Fidel's original socialist dream has long been dead, and they want changes. But they are also wary of what full-blooded western capitalism might bring. They do not want to lose the ""gains of the revolution""-a welfare state, free education and health care. These are real achievements for such a relatively poor country, although the country's dismal economy has now crippled all three. Many would like to see Fidel retire gracefully. Few are keen on a violent overthrow. 
Intelligent, capable, capricious, Mr Castro retains almost total control over every aspect of government-which is the biggest reason why the country is in such a mess. In the words of one restaurant owner: ""As soon as something begins to work, it is halted. As soon as anything becomes profitable, it is stopped."" 
After a series of crackdowns on private sector activity, Cubans have become wary and secretive. Most do not keep bank accounts (because the government would then know how much money they have). The black economy is huge, and more efficient than the state sector. But it corrodes certain values and is undermining the public sector itself. Doctors steal drugs from hospitals to sell for dollars. State stores and markets are surrounded by people selling pilfered goods. 
The sugar harvest in 1998, beset by a series of weather disasters, was 3.zm tonnes: the smallest crop in 50 years. Hit by low prices for sugar and nickel, Cuba's main products, the country's overall exports fell by ii% while imports grew by 6%. Its trade deficit was over $2 billion in 1997. Once the final figures are calculated for 1998, the total trade deficit is likely to be far worse. 
When Mr Castro took power, he based development on the ""three pillars of the Cuban revolution"": health, education and industrialisation. The Cuban economy now rests on just two pillars: tourism-Cuba's biggest hard-currency earner-and Miami. Money sent by Cuban exiles to relations in Cuba is now estimated to bring the island over $1 billion a year in cash alone, more than Cuba earns from sugar exports. 
As the 40th-anniversary speeches drone on, two questions will be on most Cubans' minds: how will the reign of Fidel come to an end, and what will happen when he goes? Of course, most people want a peaceful change of power. This is most likely if Mr Castro hands it over willingly. The ""Pinochet scenario"" is often discussed sotto voce, but it is unlikely to happen largely because Mr Castro is not the kind of man to stand aside. Moreover, General Pinochet's detention in Britain shows that it may no longer be safe to be a former dictator, at least a travelling one. 
It is more likely that Mr Castro, now aged 72, will die in harness, ranting and speechifying to his last breath. Unfortunately for Cuba's future, he is in good health, despite rumours to the contrary. If he does die in office, with no effort at a transition to democratic rule, Cubans could face the violence and political chaos they fear the most. The designated heir is General Raul Castro, Fidel's brother and head of the armed forces. But he is not popular, and is only five years younger than Fidel. Few think he would be able to hold on to power for long. A small group of technocrats who have occasionally succeeded in persuading a reluctant Mr Castro to loosen economic controls might gain power and then ease Cuba towards democracy. But the chances ofthis happening do not look high. With Fidel's passing, such technocrats are likely to lose all authority. 
However Mr Castro departs, his successors will immediately face not only pentup demands at home, but also demands for the return of property seized by the Castro government, or for compensation. Ownership of oil refineries, hotels, farmland, nickel mines-all currently run by foreign investors-is claimed by American citizens or Cuban exiles. Many houses, now occupied by several families, and many buildings that have been turned into schools or hospitals, once belonged to people who are now living in Miami. For this reason alone, the return of the exiles from Miami is dreaded by many Cubans. Their anxiety has been ruthlessly exploited by the regime, but it is real nonetheless. 
Forty years of being dominated by one loquacious, erratic man has left Cubans with a ruined economy, disintegrating public services and an uncertain future. With no plausible political heirs in sight, no credible opposition and an exile community itching not only for return, but revenge, Cubans are right to fear chaos or even civil war after Mr Castro goes. Not much of a legacy, nor much to celebrate.  1999 IT WAS not supposed to be like this. When Fernando Henrique Cardoso persuaded his country's Congress to overturn a constitutional ban on incumbents seeking reelection, he seemed to have the credentials to enter history not just as the man who had vanquished his country's chronic inflation, but as a great modernising leader of a kind Brazil had not seen for three decades. 
He may yet achieve such stature But, as he starts his second term on January 1st, Brazil's prospects are gloomy, and fraught with risk. Mr Cardoso had once hoped that his second term would be devoted to social and political reform-the president is, after all, a social democrat in an unequal and unjust country. Instead, Mr Cardoso must grapple with the pressing unfinished business of his first term: shoring up the country's precarious economic and financial stability. 
That involves swiftly completing the task of getting Congress to approve a huge fiscal squeeze, involving tax increases and spending cuts amounting to 28 billion reais ($23.5 billion) and aimed at cutting the fiscal deficit from 8% of GDP in 1998 to around 4.7% in 1999. That is the main condition of the $41.5 billion rescue package which the IMF agreed to in November, and which the government hopes will restore confidence in Brazil's economic policies. 
Success would mean that in a year's time Brazil might emerge from recession with its economy fundamentally strengthened. Failure would mean not just a forced devaluation of Brazil's currency, but would also damage Mr Cardoso's credibility, perhaps irreparably. Since August, his government has spent over $30 billion in reserves defending the real, and its defence was the platform on which he won the presidential election in October. But even if Mr Cardoso succeeds in making fiscal austerity stick, Brazil is clearly facing a hard year in 1999. 
As expected, Mr Cardoso's team has not radically changed. Of 31 ministers and secretaries, 23 served in the first administration. The dozen front-line ministers to keep their jobs include Pedro Malan, the finance minister and architect of the IMF agreement, whose position has grown steadily stronger as the economy has weakened. 
A sign of this is Mr Cardoso's choice of Celso Lafer to head a new Ministry of Development, which will handle industrial policy. The creation of this ministry is intended to make fiscal austerity more politically palatable. It is seen as a potential source of alternative policies by those, such as FIESP, the Sao Paulo industrialists' federation, who dislike Mr Malan's orthodoxies and would prefer devaluation, lower interest rates and higher tariffs. Yet Mr Lafer is unlikely to oblige them. Though once a director of a family metal-bashing firm, and the cousin of FIESP'S energetic new chairman, Mr Lafer is an academic whose last job was as Brazil's ambassador to the World Trade Organisation. He lacks the political clout, and probably the inclination, to challenge Mr Malan. 
Mr Cardoso has left the main social ministries in the hands of his own Social Democratic Party. Paulo Renato de Souza stays as education minister, a job he has held for four years-a rare and effective example of continuity in a crucial area that is often poorly administered in Latin America. Like Jose Serra, the health minister, his task is now to make a smaller budget go further. A dozen other ministers owe theirjobs to Mr Cardoso's need to satisfy his allies in his four-party, centre-right coalition. The president has made it plain that to keep their jobs they have to deliver votes in Congress for the austerity measures. 
Marshalling its broad but unreliable majority in Congress remains the government's biggest challenge. According to David Fleischer,a political scientist at the University of Brasilia, the big winner in the new team (apart from Mr Malan) is Clovis Carvalho, the presidents chief of staff. A plan to set up a new Ministry of Government, which would have handled political liaison and encroached on Mr Carvalho's turf, has come to nothing. 
But Mr Carvalho is widely disliked in Congress. Already, the government's failings in this area have cost it dearly. Poor liaison with Congress was the main reason for two setbacks in the implementation of the fiscal package. The first was the defeat last month of a law increasing civil servants' pension contributions, an unpopular but essential measure. The second was the government's delay in presenting a bill to extend and increase a tax on bank cheques. These setbacks could cost the government up to to billion reais in 1999, and they have already set off a new round of jitters in the financial markets. 
All is not yet lost. On December 3oth, the government announced emergency tax rises and spending cuts aimed at raising 6.7 billion reais. The new Congress elected in October, which starts work in February, may be more tractable. Mr Fleischer points out that about 50 of the more notorious backsliders in the ruling coalition will not be returning. In due course, the government will try again to get approval for higher pension contributions. 
But time is short. At the end of February, the In.iF will make its first check on Brazil's progress. The financial markets will make their own, and probably more rigorous, judgment. By then, the government must take credible steps to make austerity stick. Otherwise, Mr Cardoso risks going into history as the leader who, by failing to give firm fiscal underpinning to the real, squandered Brazil's best development opportunity in more than a generation.  1999 Facing a strengthened opposition, India's ruling party confronts progress 
MOTHER TERESA was no saint but a Christian zealot who terrorised those who refused to convert. Amartya Sen was slightly more deserving of his Nobel prize (for economics), but the mass literacy he champions would seduce Hindus away from their religion. These startling views come from Ashok Singhal, president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council). That Christians make up a tiny (2.3%) share of India's population makes the remarks even more bizarre. But they count for something. At virtually the same time Mr Singhal was sounding off, Hindu militants were attacking Christians and their churches in the western state of Gujarat. Mr Singhal's group is an influential associate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which leads a family of Hindunationalist groups to which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India's ruling party, also belongs. 
The sJP seems embarrassed. It governs Gujarat and the attacks are continuing. On December 3oth mobs set fire to two Roman Catholic prayer halls. Though far from communal violence at its worst, the attacks undermine the party's boast that minorities are secure where it rules and feed the claim of a resurgent opposition that the sJP is the party of intolerance. The sJP-led government has sent officials to Gujarat to investigate. 
All great political parties have wings and fringes, sJs-men point out. Look at New and Old Labour in Britain and America's Republican Party, which encompasses flat-taxers and fundamentalists, internationalists and isolationists. But there is a difference. Most successful parties suborn ideology to the achievement of power. The BJP, on the other hand, is the creation of an ideological brotherhood that regards politics as the handmaiden of culture and religion. It is as if the Republican Party were the political wing of a less benign version of the Christian Coalition. That deformity is hobbling India's government. 
So far, mostly in economic policy. Following the BJP's humiliation in three state elections in November, it briefly looked as if the party's pragmatists would tame the ideologues of the RSS. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, shuffled his cabinet and appointed allies not beloved ofthe Rss. The winter session of Parliament was supposed to show that the BJP could govern in spite of tensions within the Rss and among the 18 parties in the ruling coalition. 
It proved no such thing. The government had wanted to pass some 40 bills; in the event just 17 were introduced to the lower house of Parliament and just 14 were passed. Among the casualties were two much-touted economic reform bills, one to open insurance to competition and foreign investment, the other to curb piracy of patented products. Both measures attracted opposition, some of it from trade unionists, who regard competition as a threat to jobs, some of it from left-wing parties allergic to liberalisation. But the opposition that mattered most came from the BjP's own swadeshi (buy Indian) lobby, which takes its cue from the Rss rather than from Mr Vajpayee. Both bills stalled. Though the government now talks of starting the next session of Parliament early to get them passed, it remains to be seen whether the swadeshi lobby will allow this. 
The BJP has had more luck keeping the blandishments of Mr Singhal and people like him from becoming national policy. The large number of parties in the coalition, in most respects a hindrance to good government, have supplied Mr Vajpayee with an excuse. The coalition's governing manifesto drops significant portions of the Hindu-nationalist wish-list, such as the call to end the autonomy granted under the constitution to Jammu & Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. Proximity to power has mellowed even the home minister, LK. Advani, the ideologues' most powerful friend in government. On December 6th, six years after the Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu militants, he called its destruction ""singularly unfortunate"". His regret is an affront to the RSS'S saffron brigades, whose dearest wish is to build a temple on what they believe to be the birthplace of the god Ram. 
To Christians such sentiments ring hollow. Yet the BJP must at least pretend to disavow the ideologues to retain power. It is not that Hindus reject Hindutva, the notion that India is defined by its Hindu way of life. According to a recent poll in India Today, most Indians support Hindutva nostrums, such as the compulsory singing in schools of ""Vande Mataram"", a patriotic song offensive to some Muslims. But not fervently enough to overlook the BJP's failings in government. Indians fault the BJP for the blundering of the hydraheaded coalition it leads and a rise in the price of onions and other staples. They think the opposition Congress party would provide more stable and competent government. The poll suggested that if an election were called now, Congress would trounce the BJP. 
The BJP cannot recoup by fanning communal tensions. One reason Congress did well in November's state elections was that minorities, especially Muslims, returned to their traditional support of the party after a period of disenchantment. A BJP-inspired outbreak of communal violence would drive many Hindus in the same direction. Most of the party's leaders, though not Rss die-hards, realise that it would confirm the B's inability to govern. 
Achieving such enlightenment on economic reform is harder. There are few votes in promoting the interests of foreign insurers and pharmaceutical firms, the most ob vious beneficiaries of insurance and patent legislation. When the executive committee of the BJP meets in Bangalore on January 2nd and 3rd, Mr Vajpayee will try to persuade his colleagues that such reforms also belong to the compulsions of power. The Hindu-nationalist family is being made to swallow a show of tolerance in Delhi, if not in Gujarat. Can it be forced to swallow progress as well?  1999 YET another government has collapsed in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal. The latest political crisis arose when the prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, resigned after one of his partners pulled out of the ruling coalition. Though Mr Koirala has put together a new coalition and was reappointed to the prime ministership by King Birendra on December 23rd, the new government-the sixth since the last general election in 1994-will not last long either: Mr Koirala hopes to win approval from parliament on January 14th for an election in April. 
Nepal has been struggling to establish a stable form of multi-party government since April 199o, when a pro-democracy movement obliged King Birendra to end his almost absolute rule and become a constitutional monarch. Since no single party has been able to count on a majority, all sorts of ideologically incompatible coalitions have been formed. In order to encompass a wide range of parties, they have often been burdened with huge cabinets (one had 48 ministers). 
Mr Koirala's latest coalition includes one of Nepal's two main communist parties, the United Marxist Leninist Party (which is not really much to the left of the prime minister's centrist Nepali Congress Party). The outgoing partner in the previous coalition was the other main communist group which, confusingly, also calls itself the Marxist Leninists. The coalition also includes the Nepal Sadbhavana, a regional party. The prime minister has managed to keep his cabinet to just ni members-one of them, for the first time in eight years, a nominee of the king. 
Since Nepal has seen so much political paralysis, the euphoria that accompanied the end of the king's rule in one of the world's poorest countries has long faded. ""We are just muddling through,"" says Sridhar Khatri, a professor of political science at Tribhuvan University in Katmandu. ""There is no political architecture emerging."" Some blame a Supreme Court ruling that has prevented several prime ministers from dissolving parliament and holding an election. That has obliged politicians to stay in power on the basis of opportunistic agreements. 
Will the new poll produce a clear winner? Opinion differs. Some people argue that the Nepali Congress Party has a good chance ofwinning a majority because it is now more united. Others foresee yet another hung parliament. 
The result may well depend on how Nepal's communists divide their votes among the various parties. A Maoist group could also disrupt the election. It is involved in an increasingly bloody insurgency, which has claimed over 400 lives since it began in February 1996.  1999 SENIOR Khmer Rouge leaders have apologised, for the first time, for the suffering they caused between 1975 and 1979 when some 1.7m people are reckoned to have died during the movement's reign of terror. Speaking to reporters in Phnom Penh, Khieu Samphan, aged 67, the former nominal leader of the Khmers Rouges, was asked if he had regrets about what they had done. He replied, ""Yes, sorry, very sorry."" Sitting alongside him, looking uneasy, was Nuon Chea, aged 71, the movement's chief ideologue, and Brother Number Two to Pol Pot, who died in the jungle in 1998. Silent for most of the 3o-minute press conference, he offered a rather bizarre apology: for the deaths of animals as well as people. ""They all died because we wanted to win the war,"" he said. 
Suggestions that the pair should stand trial before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity were brushed aside. Mr Samphan said the outside world should let Cambodia solve its own problems. ""Let bygones be bygones,"" he said, repeating the dismissivewords used byprevious Khmer Rouge defectors. He did, however, acknowledge the bitterness felt by many Cambodians whose families had been murdered. He had experienced their anger at first hand in 1991 when he narrowly escaped lynching after returning to Phnom Penh from a meeting in Paris to bring a formal end to the civil war. 
This time there was no lynch mob. The casual observer might have been forgiven for thinking the two men were diplomats enjoying vip treatment. They were warmly welcomed by the prime minister, Hun Sen, on December 29th at his residence on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital, and treated to lunch. They have been staying at a luxury hotel, equipped with a swimming pool, tennis courts and golf range. 
Mr Hun Sen indicated that it was unlikely that the pair would have to face trial for crimes against humanity. He said such a trial would be divisive and might mean a return to civil war. His argument has not been well received by many Cambodians. Allowing rank-and-file former Khmers Rouges to make new lives without punishment is mainly accepted. But there is opposition to such tolerance being extended to Pol Pot's henchmen. Many Cambodians say they are not concerned so much about retribution. But they believe a trial might throw light on why the Khmers Rouges sought to bring such misery to the country. 
King Sihanouk, sensing growing public anger over the soft treatment of the pair, has now said that he would not be willing to grant an amnesty to the two men. In part, that is academic. Neither man has yet been charged with anything. For his part, King Sihanouk has said he believes any international court would have the ""perfect right"" to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia. Two years ago, the king, under pressure from the Cambodian government, pardoned leng Sary, who had once been Pol Pofs foreign minister, but had more recently become a useful go-between in arranging defections. In 1979 he had been sentenced to death, in his absence, for genocide. Prince Sihanouk, as he was, briefly held the office of head of state under the Khmers Rouges. He was virtually a prisoner in his palace but may be embarrassed by the connection to the regime. 
Human-rights groups also believe that Mr Samphan and Mr Nuon Chea should be brought to trial. They bear responsibility for many of the Khmers Rouges' misdeeds, and the groups say it is important to break Cambodia's ""culture of impunity"", where killers go free while petty thieves without protection from powerful people are jailed.  1999 China was supposed to be growing more tolerant of dissent. It isn't 
THE authorities dithered for months, then showed their mailed fist. Orga-, nisers of the first, open opposition to Communist rule, the Chinese Democratic Party, which declared itself last summer by attempting to register in 14 provinces and big cities, were rounded up in late November. On December 21st, Xu Wenli, a veteran of the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79, began a 13-year sentence for ""attempting to overthrow the state"". At least he was allowed a lawyer, through whom he smuggled out a note declaring that his ""so-called open trial was in truth nothing more than a means for political persecution"". 
Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai were denied legal defence. Mr Qin, another Democracy Wall veteran, was jailed for 12 years and Mr Wang, a student leader at the time of the Tiananmen protests in 1989, got ii years. In case the message of Communist intolerance was still not clear, on December 27th, Zhang Shanguang was sent to prison for ten years for giving Radio Free Asia, financed by America, details of farmers' protests in central Hunan province. 
Western governments have delivered unusually forceful protests. But anger is overlaid with embarrassment. After all, the same Chinese leaders who decided upon the stiff sentences are those whose backs are slapped at international gatherings for their economic sophistication. And much has been made by Bill Clinton's administration of the new policy of engagement rather than confrontation with China over human rights. For a time, success appeared to be at hand. China's two most prominent jailed dissidents were released into American care, Wei Jingsheng in 1997 and Wang Dan in April 1998. A third, Liu Nianchun, was released on medical grounds to America on December 22th. 
Mr Clinton's state visit last June seemed to coincide with a new air of tolerance in China, a thaw warm enough to be termed a ""Beijing spring"". Just last October China signed (but did not ratify) the United Nations covenant on civil and political rights. Now the engagement scorecard looks less impressive: three dissidents released, but four others newly sent to prison. Though China may well see these as future chips (their exile in return for western concessions in other fields), America will find it harder to justify such Faustian bargains. 
Some in western governments hope a rod can be held to China's back with the annual UN review of its human-rights record. In the past China has dissuaded the Geneva panel from passing judgment. Success this time cannot be assured. But China either thinks that a damning at the UN can be avoided as usual, as western criticism gives way to commercial self-interest, or that a rebuke is worth bearing. 
Either way, China's leaders will not put international outrage above any internal threats to their iron rule. The proletariat and peasantry, whom they claim to represent, pose a restive threat to ""stability"", as iron-rice-bowl jobs are lost and new jobs are hard to find. Some western analysts think that China's economy is through the worst of its troubles. Indeed, on December 3oth the government announced the economy had grown by a remarkable 7.8% in 1998-not far short of the 8% target that China's leaders had ""guaranteed"". But Chinese statistics are not reliable, and the growth figures have been hugely inflated. 
Moreover, the coming year is full of events whose political symbolism the party alone must define, among them the 5oth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic and the return of Macau, a Portuguese enclave, to the ""motherland"". The jailing of dissidents is just one way the Chinese government is setting the tone. 
President Jiang Zemin has recently given stern speeches promising to nip dissent ""in the bud"". Fresh threats have been issued to workers thinking of organising independently. New rules threaten film directors, singers and software developers with life imprisonment if they ""endanger national security"". And on the edges of China's empire, the rhetoric has been turned up. In the western province of Xinjiang, the party secretary declares that the situation there is getting ""acute and complicated"", justification for hardline vigilance. 
The combination of a new political chill together with evidence of delay in some of China's most pressing economic reforms has shaken the assumptions of many western observers. Some have even begun to wonder aloud whether China's ""reform period"" is drawing to a close. But nothing has really changed. Since the Tiananmen threat to one-party rule, the Communists' determination ought not to have been in doubt: reforms and greater openness of expression, though welcome in principle, will not willingly be allowed at the expense of Communist authority.  1999 More bombast than policy on both sides as America and Britain confront Iraq 
IT IS easier to start a fight with Iraq than to end one. So America and Britain discovered when they called off their four-day bombing campaign against Iraq on December 19th, only to find the Iraqis taking repeated pot-shots at their pilots ten days later amid a row over the ""no-fly zones"" that cover half the country. So, indeed, the past eight years have shown, as successive American and British governments have enforced the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 199o. Has the latest episode brought a conclusion any closer? 
The bombing did put an end, at least for the time being, to the work of Unscom, the United Nations body charged with disposing of Iraq's deadliest weapons. In the wake of the American and British attack, Iraq announced that the arms inspectors, who had fled the country hours before the bombing began, would not be allowed back. 
Never fear, insisted American officials, their bombs had made a significant dent in Saddam Hussein's weapons programmes. General Henry Shelton, America's top soldier, announced that nine Iraqi missile factories had been put out of operation ""for at least a year"", while his British counterpart proudly described the destruction of special aircraft designed to spray biological and chemical stuff. The two powers also claimed to have blitzed barracks, ministries, presidential palaces and various factories that might otherwise, they said, have been put to nefarious purposes. 
But the Iraqis are dab hands at hiding their assets, as Unscom's inspectors have long complained. They shrugged off the attacks, insisting, quite credibly, that most of the destroyed buildings had already been emptied of men and machinery. One serving Unscom inspector questioned the usefulness of the bombing; he might also have asked why, if America and Britain knew where to find Mr Hussein's secret weapons, they had not let the inspectors know. 
Much of the rest of the world was equally unimpressed. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called the strikes ""illegal and senseless"" and briefly recalled his ambassadors from America and Britain. France protested by pulling its aircraft out of the force that has been patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq (it had earlier withdrawn from the northern patrol) Arabs took to the streets throughout the Middle East, storming the American embassy in Damascus and demonstrating in Rabat. Their embarrassed governments protested more mutedly, but did complain that the bombing had undermined any hope of persuading Iraq to co-operate with the UN and thus be rehabilitated into the world. 
America and Britain retort that they are as keen as everyone else to sort out the whole mess. After they called off their bombers, they produced a new five-point strategy for dealing with Iraq. They will keep up their threat of force, encourage the Iraqi opposition, try to get inspections under way again, step up patrols of the Gulf against sanctions-busting smugglers and launch a diplomatic offensive to bring the world round to their point of view. 
As energetic as all this sounds, it amounts to almost nothing. Mr Hussein has weathered many bombings, and doubtless thinks he can survive a few more. The Iraqi opposition is laughable, and the $97m earmarked for it by America even more so (each of the 325 cruise missiles fired at Iraq during the bombing campaign cost $1.2m) America's only plan to get the inspectors back into Iraq is to refuse to lift sanctions until they have finished their work. Although smugglers do get round the sanctions, they do so chiefly through Iran and Syria, where America has little influence, or through Turkey, where it winks at the infractions. And America is already trying to persuade the rest of the world to swallow its Iraqi policy, with ever-dwindling success. Essentially, America and Britain plan to let Iraq stew. 
The Iraqis complain that they have been left to stew painfully for eight years under the most all-encompassing sanctions in history, with no hope of a reprieve. All along Mr Hussein has tried to protest and prod until the international consensus on sanctions falls apart. Although frustrating Unscom was his favourite means of attracting attention, he is already testing new methods of challenging America's stranglehold. The current spate of attacks on aircraft in the no-fly zone, or his renewed threat to end the UN's humanitarian programme, could both bring about a new crisis. 
So far, no country has broken ranks and openly defied the sanctions, although several-especially the Arab states-have called for their lifting. But with Unscom out of action, it will become ever harder for the Americans to argue that the unending embargo is designed to enforce the internationally accepted aim of arms control, rather than to serve America's and Britain's interest in keeping Mr Hussein (together with the unfortunate Iraqi people) contained in a cage. Iraq has complained that Arab foreign ministers delayed a meeting to discuss the situation at the behest of such good American allies as Saudi Arabia. They are unlikely to delay for ever.  1999 ISRAEL'S parliament, the Knesset, having deposed Binyamin Netanyahu and dissolved itself, has now decided on a ludicrously long election campaign of nearly five months. The vote will take place on May 17th, with the likely run-off vote for prime minister to be held on June ist. 
The decision to drag it out-the law allows for an election within two monthscame in consultations this week between Mr Netanyahu's Likud and the opposition Labour Party, led by Ehud Barak. Both are seriously rattled by the meteoric rise to the top of the opinion polls of Amnon LipkinShahak, the recently retired army chief of staff. Mr Shahak, blue-eyed and soft-spoken, has yet formally to declare his candidacy for prime minister, at the head of a new centrist party. But he is already attracting defectors from both the big parties, as well as promises of support from businessmen. Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak both hope that Mr Shahak has peaked too soon and that a long and costly campaign will exhaust his appeal. 
Some in the peace camp, including Israel's convention-flouting president, Ezer Weizman, fear that Mr Barak (also a former chief of staff) and Mr Shahak will exhaust each other, with Mr Netanyahu reaping the benefit. But others argue that Mr Shahak's candidacy could help draw those traditionally opposed to Labour away from the Likud candidate in the first round. Then, if Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak made it to the run-off, Mr Shahak would urge his supporters to back Mr Barak. If Mr Shahak got through, Mr Barak would obviously support him against Mr Netanyahu. And a strong showing by the centrist party in the vote for the Knesset, say the optimists, might give Mr Barak or Mr Shahak, if either won the prime ministership, the chance to set up a broad coalition without the Likud. 
Mr Barak's need to break down the old voting patterns has prompted him to offer a haven to Mr Netanyahu's former foreign minister, David Levy, one of the many politicians to have become unmoored in the storm.A month ago, Mr Netanyahu suggested that Mr Levy should return to the Likud, and to the cabinet, as minister of finance. But they argued, both over policy and over the reabsorption of Mr Levy's breakaway Gesher faction into the mother-party. Now Mr Levy, once a bricklayer and always a champion of the have-nots, has turned to Labour, saying that Mr Barak is ""the only candidate speaking clearly"" on social issues. 
Mr Barak hopes that Mr Levy's advent will persuade others in the Labour Party not to bolt for the centre-though the Labour air is thick with restless threats. In the Likud, the bolting has begun. Dan Meridor, whom Mr Netanyahu forced out of his cabinet a year ago, has left the party and announced his candidacy for prime minister as a centrist (he and Mr Shahak will eventually decide between them who will be the candidate and who the number two). And Benny Begin, also once a minister under Mr Netanyahu, has proclaimed a new party of the right, loyal to the Likud's nowcompromised belief in Greater Israel, with himself as its leader and candidate for prime minister. 
Mr Netanyahu is now desperately trying to dissuade the popular minister of defence, Yitzhak Mordechai, and the lone woman in his cabinet, Limor Livnat, from joining the centrists. He is also troubled by hints from the foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, his staunchest ally in recent months, that ""in special circumstances"" he would consider standing for prime minister. 
Mr Netanyahu is not done for yet. He surged from behind to defeat Shimon Peres in 1996, and this time he is both the underdog and the incumbent. His brand of raw rhetoric on the hustings and his manipulative skills should thrive in these conditions. 
But his failure to keep Mr Meridor and Mr Begin inside his depleted tent could prove fatal. These two, both princes of the Likud blood (Mr Meridor's father was a comrade-in-arms of Menachem Begin, the party's founder), and both widely respected for their honesty, will be pounding away throughout the campaign at Mr Netanyahu's weakest spot: his credibility. His way of winning power, and then holding together a creaky coalition for 30 months, has been to tell people, all people, whatever they wanted to hear. Now, with elections approaching, they are comparing notes.  1999 ISRAEL'S parliament, the Knesset, having deposed Binyamin Netanyahu and dissolved itself, has now decided on a ludicrously long election campaign of nearly five months.

Now, with elections approaching, they are comparing notes.  1999 HELL and heaven are separated by a 20minute drive along clogged streets. The centre of Angola's capital, Luanda, is a wasteland of piled-up rubbish, broken pavements and broken people; amputees from the war and its landmines beg at every corner. At the United Nations base on the outskirts of Luanda, freshly watered herbaceous borders run between rows of mobile homes. To keep the UN bureaucrats healthy and happy there are tennis courts and a swimming pool plus an all-American bar where beer can be bought only with dollars. 
The government blames this haven of peace for the resurgence of the country's civil war in early December, venomously attacking the UN Observer Mission in Angola for incompetence. It claims that, if the UN had been doing its job properly, Jonas Savimbi, the UNITA rebel leader, would not have been able to stockpile weapons when, under the terms of the 1994 Lusaka protocol, he should have been handing them in. 
They have a point. The UN's strategy was to make the most of the peace process in order to keep it going. UN officials regularly announced how many weapons had been handed in and how many soldiers and rebels were being demobilised at UN assembly points. No matter that many of the weapons were rusty and many ofthe UNITA ""soldiers"" at the centres were mere boys recruited a few weeks before. 
But if the UN failed to spot Mr Savimbi's shopping habits in the world's arms markets, it also failed to draw attention to the government's crude lack of interest in a true peace. In territory abandoned by UNITA, where people were desperate for food and medicine, the government instead sent in thuggish policemen who, without supplies of their own, stole the last local food stocks. 
On December 5th, the Angolan army attacked UNITA'S strongholds at Andulo and Bailundo in the central highlands. At the same time, the ruling MPLA party, holding its annual congress in Luanda, replaced many veteran members with more military-minded men. The shuffle clearly signalled all-out war: the party bosses were hoping to plant the government flag in the heart of the territory that Mr Savimbi once held. 
Most thought that would be easy. The rebels have no outside allies left. They are supposedly cut off by UN sanctions from both weapons suppliers and diamond buyers, and they have been weakened by attacks on their rear bases in Congo. But Mr Savimbi's forces proved stronger than expected and, by December 9th, UNITA was announcing that the government forces were in retreat ""having been beaten at their own game"". They were sent reeling as far as Kuito, which UNITA seemed on the point of seizing. Except that, at that point, the rebels ran out of petrol. 
Angola makes $2 billion-3 billion a year from oil, and UNITA usually has no difficulty finding supplies. This time, however, the rebels did not expect to find themselves advancing so fast. Like everyone else, they had overestimated government strength, and underestimated their own. 
This gave the government a chance to regroup. The rebels set about shelling Kuito and fierce fighting is reported in Bie and Huambo provinces. On December 26th a uN-chartered flight with four crew and ten UN officials crashed near Huambo. Both sides accuse the other of shooting it down. 
Four days after the crash, the UN'S special representative, Issa Diallo, was still trying to get a local ceasefire to allow a search mission to look for survivors. The government said the aircraft had come down in UNITA-held territory and so it was not their business. The rebels denied having received any request from Mr Diallo until late on December 28th. UNITA also says that the government is carrying out air strikes on its headquarters, making communication impossible. 
In short, neither side has shown the slightest interest in helping Mr Diallo look for the missing 14 people, let alone agreeing to a ceasefire or trying to work out a way of ending the war.  1999 The AIDS virus had infected 47m people, and shows no signs of slowing. It cannot be cured. Can it be curbed? 
IN RICH countries AIDS is no longer a death sentence. Expensive drugs keep Hv-positive patients alive and healthy, perhaps indefinitely. Loud public-awareness campaigns keep the number of infected Americans,Japanese and West Europeans to relatively low levels. The sense of crisis is past. 
In developing countries, by contrast, the disease is spreading like nerve gas in a gentle breeze. The poor cannot afford to spend $lo,ooo a year on wonder-pills. Millions of Africans are dying. In the longer term, even greater numbers of Asians are at risk. For many poor countries, there is no greater or more immediate threat to public health and economic growth. Yet few political leaders treat it as a priority. 
Since HIV was first identified in the 1970s, over 47m people have been infected, of whom 14m have died. Last year saw the biggest annual death toll yet: 2.5m. The disease now ranks fourth among the world's big killers, after respiratory infections, diarrhoeal disorders and tuberculosis. It now claims many more lives each year than malaria, a growing menace, and is still nowhere near its peak. If India, China and other Asian countries do not take it seriously, the number of infections could reach ""a new order of magnitude"", says Peter Piot, head of the UN'S AIDS programme. 
The human immuno-deficiency virus (HiV), which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs) is thought to have crossed from chimpanzees to humans in the late 19q.os or early 1950s in Congo. It took several years for the virus to break out of Congo's dense and sparsely populated jungles but, once it did, it marched with rebel armies through the continent's numerous war zones, rode with truckers from one rest-stop brothel to the next, and eventually flew, perhaps with an air steward, to America, where it was discovered in the early 1980s. As American homosexuals and drug injectors started to wake up to the dangers of bath-houses and needle-sharing, AIDS was already devastating Africa. 
So far, the worst-hit areas are east and southern Africa. In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, between a fifth and a quarter of people aged 15-49 are afflicted with HIV or AIDS. In Botswana, children born early in the next decade will have a life expectancy of 40; without AIDS, it would have been nearer 7o. Of the 25 monitoring sites in Zimbabwe where pregnant women are tested for HIV, only two in 1997 showed prevalence below lO%. At the remaining 23 sites, 20-5o% of women were infected. About a third of these women will pass the virus on to their babies. 
The region's giant, South Africa, was largely protected by its isolation from the rest of the world during the apartheid years. Now it is host to one in ten of the world's new infections-more than any other country. In the country's most populous province, KwaZulu-Natal, perhaps a third of sexually active adults are HIV-positive. 
Asia is the next disaster-in-waiting. Already, 7m Asians are infected. India's 930m people look increasingly vulnerable. The Indian countryside, which most people imagined relatively AIDs-free, turns out not to be. A recent study in Tamil Nadu found over 2% of rural people to be Hiv-positive: 500,ooo people in one of India's smallest states. Since lO% had other sexually transmitted diseases (STDS), the avenue for further infections is clearly open. A survey of female STD patients in Poona, in Maharashtra, found that over 9o% had never had sex with anyone but their husband; and yet 13.6% had HIv. China is not far behind. 
No one knows what AIDS will do to poor countries' economies, for nowhere has the epidemic run its course. An optimistic assessment, by Alan Whiteside of the University of Natal, suggests that the effect of AIDS on measurable GDP will be slight Even at high prevalence, Mr Whiteside thinks it will slow growth by no more than o.6% a year. This is because so many people in poor countries do not contribute much to the formal economy. To put it even more crudely, where there is a huge oversupply of unskilled labour, the dead can easily be replaced. Some people argue that those who survive the epidemic will benefit from a tighter job market. After the Black Death killed a third of the population of medieval Europe, labour scarcity forced landowners to pay their workers better. 
Other researchers are more pessimistic. AIDS takes longer to kill than did the plague, so the cost of caring for the sick will be more crippling. Modern governments, unlike medieval ones, tax the healthy to help look after the ailing, so the burden will fall on everyone. And AIDS, because it is sexually transmitted, tends to hit the most energetic and productive members of society. A recent study in Namibia estimated that AIDS cost the country almost 8% of GNP in 6. Another analysis predicts that Kenya's GDP will be 14.5% smaller in zoos than it would have been without AIDS, and that income per person will be lo% lower. 
The cost of the disease 
In general, the more advanced the economy, the worse it will be affected by a large number of AIDS deaths. South Africa, with its advanced industries, already suffers a shortage of skilled manpower, and cannot afford to lose more. In better-off developing countries, people have more savings to fall back on when they need to pay medical bills. Where people have health and life insurance, those industries will be hit by bigger claims. Insurers protect themselves by charging more or refusing policies to HIVpositive customers. In Zimbabwe, life-insurance premiums quadrupled in two years because of AIDS. Higher premiums force more people to seek treatment in public hospitals: in South Africa, HIV and AIDS could account for between 35% and 84% of public-health expenditure by zoos, according to one projection. 
Little research has been done into the effects of AIDS on private business, but the anecdotal evidence is scary. In some countries, firms have had to limit the number of days employees may take off to attend funerals. Zambia is suffering power shortages because so many engineers have died. Farmers in Zimbabwe are finding it hard to irrigate their fields because the brass fittings on their water pipes are stolen for coffin handles. In South Africa, where employers above a certain size are obliged to offer generous benefits and paid sick leave, companies will find many of their staff, as they sicken, becoming more expensive and less productive. Yet few firms are trying to raise awareness of AIDS among their workers, or considering how they will cope. 
In the public sector, where pensions and health benefits are often more generOUS, AIDS could break budgets and hobble the provision of services. In South Africa, an estimated 15% of civil servants are HIVpositive, but government departments have made little effort to plan for the coming surge in sickness. Education, too, will suffer. In Botswana, 2-5% of teachers die each year from AIDS. Many more take extended sick leave. 
At a macro level, the impact of AIDS is felt gradually. But at a household level, the blow is sudden and catastrophic. When a breadwinner develops AIDS, his (or her) family is impoverished twice over: his income vanishes, and his relations must devote time and money to nursing him. Daughters are often forced to drop out of school to help. Worse, HIV tends not to strike just one member of a family. Husbands give it to wives, mothers to babies. This correspondent's driver in Kampala lost his mother, his father, two brothers and their wives to AIDS. His story is not rare. 
Obstacles to prevention 
The best hope for halting the epidemic is a cheap vaccine. Efforts are under way, but a vaccine for a virus that mutates as rapidly as HIV will be hugely difficult and expensive to invent. For poor countries, the only practical course is to concentrate on prevention. But this, too, will be hard, for a plethora of reasons. 
Sex is fun . . . Many feel that condoms make it less so. Zimbabweans ask: ""Would you eat a sweet with its wrapper on?"" e.. . and discussion of it often taboo. In Kenya, Christian and Islamic groups have publicly burned anti-AIDS leaflets and condoms, as a protest against what they see as the encouragement of promiscuity. A study in Thailand found that infected women were only a fifth as likely to have discussed sex openly with their partners as were uninfected women. 
Myths abound. Some young African women believe that without regular infusions of sperm, they will not grow up to be beautiful. Ugandan men use this myth to seduce schoolgirls. In much of southern Africa, HIV-infected men believe that they can rid themselves of the virus by passing it on to a virgin. 
Poverty. Those who cannot afford television find other ways of passing the evening. People cannot afford antibiotics, so the untreated sores from STDS provide easy openings for HIV. 
Migrant labour. Since wages are much higher in South Africa than in the surrounding region, outsiders flock in to find work. Migrant miners (including South Africans forced to live far from their homes) spend most of the year in single-sex dormitories surrounded by prostitutes. Living with a one-in-4o chance of being killed by a rockfall, they are inured to risk. When they go home, they often infect their wives. 
War. Refugees, whether from genocide in Rwanda or state persecution in Myanmar, spread Hiv as they flee. Soldiers, with their regular pay and disdain for risk, are more likely than civilians to contract HIV from prostitutes. When they go to war, they infect others. In Africa the problem is dire. In Congo, where no fewer than seven armies are embroiled, the government has accused Ugandan troops (which are helping the Congolese rebels) of deliberately spreading AIDS. Unlikely, but with estimated HIV prevalence in the seven armies ranging from so% for the Angolans to an incredible 80% for the Zimbabweans, the effect is much the same. 
Sexism. In most poor countries, it is hard for a woman to ask her partner to use a condom. Wives who insist risk being beaten up. Rape is common, especially where wars rage. Forced sex is a particularly effective means of Hiv transmission, because of the extra blood. 
Drinking. Asia and Africa make many excellent beers. They are also home to a lot of people for whom alcohol is the quickest escape from the stresses of acute poverty. Drunken lovers are less likely to remember to use condoms. 
How to fight the virus 
Pessimists look at that list and despair. But three success stories show that the hurdles to prevention are not impossibly high. 
First, Thailand. One secret of Thailand's success has been timely, accurate information-gathering. HIV was first detected in Thailand in the mid-198os, among male homosexuals. The health ministry immediately began to monitor other high-risk groups, particularly the country's many heroin addicts and prostitutes. In the first half of 1988, HIV prevalence among drug injectors tested at one Bangkok hospital leapt from 1% to 30%. Shortly afterwards, infections soared among prostitutes. 
The response was swift. A survey of Thai sexual behaviour was conducted. The results, which showed men indulging in a phenomenal amount of unprotected commercial sex, were publicised. Thais were warned that a major epidemic would strike if their habits did not change. A ""100% condom use"" campaign persuaded prostitutes to insist on protection 90% of the time with non-regular customers. 
By the mid-199os, the government was spending $8om a year on AIDs education and palliative care. In 1990-93, the proportion of adult men reporting non-marital sex was halved, from 28% to 15%; for women, it fell from 1.7% to 0.4%. Brothel visits slumped. Only lO% of men reported seeing a prostitute in 1993, down from 22% in 199o. Among army conscripts in northern Thailand, a group both highly sexed and well-monitored, the proportion admitting to paying for sex fell from 57% in 1991 to 24% in 1995. The proportion claiming to have used condoms at their last commercial entanglement rose from 61% in 1991 to 93% in 1995. 
People lie about sex, so reported good behaviour does not necessarily mean actual good behaviour. But tumbling infections suggest that not everyone was fibbing. The number of sexually transmitted diseases reported from government clinics fell from over 4oo,ooo in 1986 to under 50,ooo in 1995. Among northern conscripts, Hrv prevalence fell by half between 1993 and 1995, from over 7% to under 3.5%. 
Most striking was the government's success in persuading people that they were at risk long before they started to see acquaintances die from AIDS. There was no attempt to play down the spread of HIV to avoid scaring off tourists, as happened in Kenya. Thais were repeatedly warned of the dangers, told how to avoid them, and left to make their own choices. Most decided that a long life was preferable to a fast one. 
Second, Uganda Thailand shows what is possible in a well-educated, fairly prosperous country. Uganda shows that there is hope even for countries that are poor and barely literate. President Yoweri Museveni recognised the threat shortly after becoming president in 1986, and deluged the country with anti-AIDs warnings. 
The key to Uganda's success is twofold. First, Mr Museveni made every government department take the problem seriously, and implement its own plan to fight the virus. Accurate surveys of sexual behaviour were done for only $20,ooo-30,ooo each. Second, he recognised that his government could do only a limited amount, so he gave free rein to scores of non-governmental organisations (NGos), usually foreign-financed, to do whatever it took to educate people about risky sex. 
The Straight Talk Foundation, for example, goes beyond simple warnings about AIDS and deals with the confusing complexities of sex. Its staff run role-playing exercises in Uganda's schools to teach adolescents how to deal with romantic situations. Its newsletter, distributed free, covers everything from nocturnal emissions to what to do if raped. Visiting AIDS workers from South Africa and Zimbabwe asked the foundation's director, Catharine Watson, how she won government permission to hand out such explicit material, and were astonished to hear that she had not felt the need to ask. 
The climate of free debate has led Ugandans to delay their sexual activity, to have fewer partners, and to use more condoms. Between 1991 and 1996, HIV prevalence among women in urban ante-natal clinics fell by half, from roughly 30% to 15%. 
Third, Senegal. If Uganda shows how a poor country can reverse the track of an epidemic, Senegal shows how to stop it from taking off in the first place. This West African country was fortunate to be several thousand miles from HIS origin. In the mid-i98os, when other parts of Africa were already blighted, Senegal was still relatively AIDs-free. In concert with non-governmental organisations and the press and broadcasters, the government set up a national AIDs-control programme to keep it that way. 
In Senegal's brothels, which had been regulated since the early 1970s, condom use was firmly encouraged. The country's blood supply was screened early and effectively. Vigorous education resulted in 95% of Senegalese adults knowing how to avoid the virus. Condom sales soared from 800,000 in 1988 to 7m in 1997. Senegalese levels of infection have remained stable and low for a decade-at around 1.2% among pregnant women. 
Contrast these three with South Africa. On December ist, World AIDS Day, President Nelson Mandela told the people of KwaZulu-Natal that HIV would devastate their communities if not checked. The speech was remarkable not for its qualityMr Mandela is always able to move audiences-but for its rarity. Unlike Mr Museveni, South Africa's leader seldom uses his authority to encourage safer sex It is a tragic omission. Whereas the potholed streets of Kampala are lined with signs promoting fidelity and condoms, this correspondent has, in eight months in South Africa, seen only two anti-AIDs posters, both in the UN'S AIDS office in Pretoria. 
How to dither and die 
South Africa has resources and skills on a scale that Uganda can only marvel at. It even has an excellent AIDs prevention plan, accepted by the new cabinet in 1994. But the plan was never implemented. The government likes to consult every conceivable ""stakeholder"", so new plans are eternally drafted and redrafted. Local authorities cannot act without orders from the central government. NGOS, many of them dependent on the powers-that-be for their finance, waste months making sure that enough of their senior management posts are filled with blacks to satisfy the ruling African National Congress. And they have minimal freedom to experiment. 
""There's an idea that if you disagree with the government, you are betraying the liberation struggle,"" says Mary Crewe, head of the Greater Johannesburg AIDS project. As a result, soldiers in the South African army are so ignorant that they snip the tips off their free condoms, and HIV has spread through South Africa as fast, according to Dr Neil McKerrow of Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, as if no preventive measures at all had been taken. 
Such bungling is not unique to South Africa. Most governments have been slow to recognise the threat from AIDS. From Bulawayo to Beijing, apathy and embarrassment have hamstrung preventive efforts. 
In anarchic countries, such as Congo and Angola, there have been almost no preventive efforts. Many people believe that the cause-a bid to restrain one of the most basic human instincts-is hopeless. As a Zimbabwean novelist, Chenjerai Hove, puts it with disturbing fatalism: ""Since our women dress to kill, we are all going to die."" But if the sexual drive is basic, so is the desire to live. If governments in poor countries wake up to the need to persuade their citizens that unprotected sex is Russian roulette, Mr Hove could be proved wrong. 
This article is indebted to a number of UNAIDS reports, including AIDS epidemic update (December i998, AIDS in Africa (November i9981 and ""A measure of success in Uganda (May 1998).  1999 1999 will not be just the year the euro was born. With Germany presiding for the next six months, the European Union has a host of other challenges 
JUST as well that the current crop of European Union leaders managed to rub along easily enough at their pre-Christmas summit in Vienna. They will be seeing a great deal more of one another in the year ahead, and in more trying circumstances. Vienna was a holding operation. Difficult questions were left for tackling at further summits in the course of 1999. Now several crunches are coming. 
The main event written into European diplomatic diaries for the first half of 1999 is a special summit in Brussels on March 24th and 25th. Here the 15 national leaders, and the European Commission as their servant, will try to reach agreement on new rules to limit EU spending from 2000 to 2006. All agree that budget reforms are essential, if the EU is to start admitting poorer countries from Central and Eastern Europe within that period. Without reforms, expansion will entail huge new spending obligations. But there are fierce differences of opinion over exactly what changes to make. 
Nobody is quite satisfied with ""Agenda 2000"", the package of tweaks and trims proposed by the commission as the basis for argument. France wants to keep farm subsidies high: it claims they are part of the Eu's ""spirit and heritage"", though the real point is that France happens to be their main beneficiary. Spain opposes cuts in regional subsidies with much the same logic. Germany wants its net contribution of $13 billion to the EU budget to be cut by at least a third. Britain wants to protect the special rebate mechanism won 15 years ago by Margaret Thatcher. Eight countries think that EU spending, roughly $100 billion in 1998, should be frozen in real terms for the foreseeable future, whereas seven are opposed or undecided. 
The main work of finding a compromise in all this will bear on Germany, which holds the Union's presidency during the first half of 1999. The timing is awkward: Germany's new Social DemocraticGreen government is still unsteady on its feet, and prone to send out erratic signals. Some countries doubt that the March deadline for a budget deal can be met, however diligent the presidency's work. 
But Germany's top diplomat in Brussels, Dietrich von Kyaw, refuses even to contemplate a postponement. He fears that failure to reach agreement in March would further set back the already much-delayed business of enlargement. He thinks the impression of a serious row among governments might rock the EU's new-born currency, the euro. And he doubts that they would be more accommodating if given more time. All countries, he says, ""will have to give up certain things to which we have become accustomed, things we feel entitled to get"" And lest finance ministers and foreign ministers appear unequal to the sacrifice, there were mutterings in Vienna about holding yet another meeting of heads of government in Bonn in February, before the Brussels summit, though Germany hopes this ""mini-summit"" will not be necessary. 
If a deal on Agenda 2000 can be reached in March, EU leaders will be spared one another's company until June. That is when they assemble in Cologne for a summit rounding off the German presidency. The agenda is likely to include the adoption of a largely symbolic ""employment pact"" for Europe, an idea pushed hard by France. The Union's leaders may well choose a new president for the European Commission and a new ""high representative"" for foreign policy(see page 48). 
But another item pencilled in for the Cologne agenda may give rise to yet another special summit-to convene a new and certainly gruelling ""inter-governmental conference"" for tidying up the EU'S constitutional arrangements. Finland, which assumes the Union's presidency on July ist, has indicated its readiness to play host to the launch of such a conference in the second half of 1999-hoping, no doubt, that a new constitutional shindig might proceed with more gusto than the one that dragged ineffectually along in the run-up to the Amsterdam summit of 1997. 
As with the financial reforms proposed in Agenda 2000,the constitutional reforms would prepare the way for enlarging the Union. If and when more countries join, for example, a new formula will be needed to fix the number of European commissioners (whose job it is to propose legislation and to run the Eu bureaucracy). The present system, whereby big countries send two commissioners to Brussels and small countries one, means an over-generous 20 commissioners already. Another area for reform concerns the Council of Ministers: countries will have to accept the wider use of majority voting there, if legislation is not to be blocked wholesale by a proliferation of national vetoes. New rules are also needed to make the voting power of each country in the council more proportionate to its size: the present system gives small countries a disproportionately big say. 
All this is delicate business. Other potential sources of tension ahead include a worsening trade row with America (sparked by an argument about bananas); the possibility of renewed fighting in Kosovo; and the pursuit, at Germany's insistence, of more effective tax ""harmonisation"" across Europe. Add to this the arrival of the euro, and elections for the European Parliament in mid-June: the implication is that EU issues will dominate national agendas in 1999 in a way not seen since the signing of the Maastricht treaty almost eight years earlier. So when the Union's leaders assemble yet again, in December in Helsinki to mark the end of the Finnish presidency, do not be surprised if their smiles look just a little strained.  1999 ARUSSIAN'S mental map of the world paints America large and everywhere else small. The United States counts for most in high matters-diplomacy and finance-as well as practical ones: the dollar, for example, is Russians' best-trusted currency for saving and commerce. Though Germany counts for a lot, Western Europe as an entity has never engaged Russian attention. 
Could this be changing? Certainly the European Union has never mattered more to Russian policymakers. The hottest topic is trade. The EU is already Russia's biggest single trading partner, with about 40% of the total. Now Russian exporters want to use the rouble's collapse (by more than two-thirds since August) to sell as much cheap steel, textiles, paper and so on to Western Europe as possible. But they are intimidated by the bureaucracy and protectionism of Brussels. So the government is lobbying on their behalf, with mixed success. ""It would be easier to push the Russians' case on steel if they had fully taken up their existing quota,"" sniffs a sympathetic Eurocrat. 
Russians also fear that EU protectionism may squeeze them out of markets in those bits of the former Soviet empire, such as Poland, now bent on joining the EU. ""There will be direct or indirect pressure for big contracts to go to western suppliers, not eastern ones,"" worries a Russian involved in trade finance. 
The Eu's expansion also has a political price. Central European countries are toughening visa regimes and customs services, making it harder for Russians to go and do business there. If Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia also join the EU, Russia's remaining influence in the region would be pushed back still farther. 
But there are compensations. Russia sees the Eu as more sympathetic than America: just as rich, but less driven by superpower thinking. ""Europe is a better partner for us, less demanding,"" says Vladimir Ryzhkov, a rising young politician. European socialists' carping at the supposedly heartless policies inflicted on Russia by American neo-liberals strikes a melodious chord in Russian ruling circles. 
Still, for all their talk of a ""missing social dimension"", European governments are still likely to take their cue from Washington when it comes to another bail-out for Russia-of which there is currently no sign. The EU'S own efforts have been mostly unimpressive. The most recent idea, $5oom in food aid, has been a blatantly self-interested move by Europe's farm lobby. Most other EU aid so far has been technical advice, often not followed, and valuable chiefly to the well-paid western consulting firms that deliver it. 
But even this may be changing a bit. The European Parliament is reviewing the technical-aid budget. Lobbying by Germany and Finland, among others, has delayed the food-aid package. There are signs of a new emphasis on dealing with the Russian regions, especially those closest to Western Europe, such as Smolensk. When Finland takes over the EU'S presidency in mid-1999, it will launch a ""northern dimension"", aimed at giving greater oomph to Eu engagement in the Baltic states and north-western Russia. 
For most Russians, the biggest practical change will be the euro. Russian importers and exporters are waking up to the need to keep accounts in euros. When they become available in physical form, Russian savers may start hedging their currency exposure, by stuffing their mattresses with euros as well as greenbacks. Those who move cash in suitcases are especially pleased: the 50o note (worth around $425), they note with approval, will be much handier than four or five of those rather inadequate $too notes.  1999 Gerhard Schroder, the new chancellor, has profited from a row with a colleague to start asserting his authority 
WHEN Gerhard Schroder lets slip a beam of quiet triumph these days, the chances are someone has mentioned Jurgen Trittin. How so? Isn't Mr Trittin the Green environment minister at the centre of a row over atomic power that some pundits claim might even split the coalition with Mr Schroder's Social Democrats? 
So he is. But Mr Trittin has also, more or less unwittingly, given the chancellor an ideal chance to show who is boss. And Mr Schroder, widely deemed indecisive since he took over two months ago, has seized it with relish. Hitherto most of his problems have been with his own party and its powerful chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, who is also finance minister. The Greens are much easier to use as a whipping-boy. 
At first glance, the coalition's nuclear scrap may seem odd. After all, both partners, unlike the previous centre-right government under Helmut Kohl, are pledged to shut down all 19 of Germany's atomic plants, which generate about a third of the country's electricity. But, crucially, they differ on timing and tactics. The Social Democrats have said that, given the political will, Germany could be nuclear-free in ten years; the Greens say five years, and threaten footdraggers with penalties. 
Not so Mr Schroder and the economics minister, Werner Muller, a non-party energy expert. They want the phasing-out to be done with the consent of industry. It would then take much longer than the hardliners believe. Otherwise the government might be hit by demands for vast compensation, not just from the domestic nuclear industry but also from French and British firms with long-term contracts to reprocess German atomic waste. A messy confrontation in the courts could delay plant closures indefinitely. 
Hence a hush-hush meeting between Messrs Schroder and Muller with energy company supremos in Bonn on December 14th, when a long-term deal's outline was sketched. Under it, the utilities would close all nuclear plants by 2019, starting in the next year or two with some of the oldest, provided the government did not flood them with regulations in the meantime. 
The pow-wow not only further upset Social Democratic zealots who have long snarled that Mr Schroder, a former member of Volkswagen's supervisory board, is too close to the bosses. It also infuriated Mr Trittin, who was neither invited nor officially informed of the result, though he is directly responsible for nuclear matters. In an apparent tit for tat, he announced he was sacking the members of two committees responsible for reactor safety and radiation protection on the ground that they were too friendly to the nuclear industry. 
Now it was Mr Schroder's turn to be livid, or at least to seem to be. Out came a statement stressing that Mr Trittin had acted without consulting the chancellery, and that this was no time for ""pompous posturing and party political symbolism"". Old Bonn hands recalled no comparable public dressing-down of a minister since the last days of the centre-left coalition under Helmut Schmidt in 1982. Hence speculation that the Schroder coalition too might be almost on the rocks. 
Probably not. True, ridding Germany of atomic power is even more of a core issue for the Greens than it is for the Social Democrats; but that is exactly why they cannot afford to stomp out of the coalition. So after more huffing and puffing a compromise will probably be hammered out at coalition talks set for January 13th. 
At any rate, Mr Trittin's relations with Mr Schroder can hardly be ""damaged beyond repair"", as some claim. Soon after the chancellor's ""pompous posturing"" charge, the pair were spotted tucking into lunch together at a Hanover restaurant They are, after all, old allies as well as sparring partners, dating back to the early 199os when Mr Schroder was in his first term as premier of Lower Saxony and Mr Trittin was in his red-Green cabinet. 
What the row does show is how Mr Schroder is step by step trying to widen his room for manoeuvre, constrained since September by two events. The first was the election result itself, which gave an unexpectedly clear parliamentary majority of21 seats to a red-Green combination and boosted the influence of the Social Democratic left under Mr Lafontaine. The second was the coalition negotiation, which was too hastily rushed through and which Mr Schroder rashly left too heavily in Mr Lafontaine's acquisitive hands. 
Since then, to jeers of ""Where is Schroder?"" even from newspapers which had been hostile to Mr Kohl, he has been seeking to claw more influence. After a skirmish with Mr Lafontaine, he took away from the finance ministry responsibility for preparing the German position at the G8 rich countries' meetings and gave it to his own economic adviser in the chancellery. Responsibility for planning economic reconstruction in ex-communist eastern Germany has been centred on the chancellery too. And Mr Schroder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, has been co-ordinating the ""alliance for work"" talks between government, employers and trade unions to find jobs for Germany's 4m jobless. 
Like Mr Schmidt, Mr Schroder is trying to turn his chancellery into a combination of power-house and think-tank. Like Mr Schmidt, he is running into plenty of opposition from his own party, as well as from his coalition partner. But he is beginning to get his way.  1999 DOUBLE tragedy continues to unfold in Transylvania, the northwestern chunk of Romania that has been a haven for ethnic Germans for some eight centuries. First is the fast disappearance of an extraordinary cultural heritage, expressed partly by the medieval architecture that Germans (known in Romanian as ""Saxons"", though in fact they came from far and wide across the German-speaking world) brought to Transylvania and preserved for centuries against staggering odds. Second, the Germans are withdrawing from the mess that is today's Romania. This means the villages and small towns, which have been a mainstay of Transylvania's rural economy, are themselves falling into ever deeper penury and degradation. 
Some 250,000-strong in 1939, a good tenth of the Germans who survived the second world war were carted off-once the communists took over-to Russian labour camps: almost none returned. Around 180,000 Germans sat tight until the mid-1970s, when Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's communist dictator, began to let a steady trickle go-at a hefty price in D-marks. Communism's fall in 1989 prompted a huge outward spurt. From 110,000, the number of Germans plummeted to 41,000 in less than two years. Now the figure has shrivelled again-to less than 17,000. The Saxon heritage could vanish. 
What is to be done? Take a little village like Viscri (which Germans still call Weisskirch)Once an almost entirely German hamlet of some 450 people, its population has stayed quite stable. But only 30-odd Germans are left-and the economy, based on farming in the lovely rolling plains around, barely exists. 
The squalor is striking. The village stands seven kilometres (four miles) from the nearest tarmac road. There is no longer a shop, bakery, clinic or garage. Rickety horse-drawn wagons far outnumber cars. There is no modern sewage system or running water. A filthy stream bubbles through the village's wide, rutted, muddy street. A telephone line was fixed up two years ago, but most of the skilled Germans (bakers, butchers, teachers, mechanics) who once kept things ticking over have gone. Fields of hops, once the village's main earner, have been abandoned. Gypsies-the butt of discrimination throughout Romania, and usually ill-educated people with scant farming skills-now count for more than half the population. Ethnic Romanians and a handful of Hungarians make up most of the rest. 
Viscri's glory is its stunning white medieval church (which gives the place its name) within a high-walled 12th-century citadel which-like 100 or so other such German fortifications in Transylvaniafended off Turks and Tatars as well as occasionally warring locals. The village's dynamic mayor, Caroline Femolend, an ethnic German, is trying to prod wellwishers outside Romania, including in the World Bank, to dip into their pockets. Otherwise, the village simply cannot survive-in human or architectural terms.  1999 DOUBLE tragedy continues to unfold in Transylvania, the northwestern chunk of Romania that has been a haven for ethnic Germans for some eight centuries.

Each year the auditors discover all manner of horrors in the accounts. Each year the parliament rubber-stamps them just the same. 
Hence the astonishment when on December 17th the parliament, angered by some ill-conceived prodding from the commission, voted to reject the accounts for 1996. The Socialists who dominate the chamber are arguing now for a vote of censure which, if carried, will oblige the entire commission to resign. 
Probably this vote will fail, as others have done before. But it is the first one to count as something more than a hopelessly empty threat. The parliament is growing in stature, thanks mainly to the powers given and promised it by the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties. These include the power to approve (or not) the appointment of a new commission, and a de facto veto over the choice of president. And, decidedly, the parliament does not like Jacques Santer, the incumbent. The budget fiasco has probably been enough to end any hopes he might have had for reappointment when his term expires at the end of 1999. 
Not that Eu heads of government were likely to make Mr Santer, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, their first choice anyway. They want someone both tougher and (ideally) more taciturn. They will try to choose someone by June, when they meet for a summit in Cologne. The frontrunner is probably still Romano Prodi, a former Italian prime minister. Felipe Gonzalez, a former Spanish one, was once much-fancied but now looks over-embroiled in controversies back home. A more plausible Spanish contender might be Javier Solana, whose term as NATO'S secretary-general ends in 1999. 
A flurry of gossip in the autumn suggested that Germany might propose its finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine. This ranks as an improbable but thought-provoking idea. The first German to head the commission, Walter Hallstein, retired in 1967. A second German presidency is long overdue. If not Mr Lafontaine, another German could carry the day. 
One early piece of horse-trading already seems to have taken place. A Frenchman, Jean Lemierre, is about to be confirmed as the new president of the EU'S Economic and Financial Committee. This group of top officials from central banks, national treasuries and the European Commission, previously known as the ""monetary committee"", is one of the most powerful behind-thescenes bodies in the Union. Until recently, an Italian, Mario Draghi, was favourite to take over its presidency. Mr Lemierre's upset victory suggests a quid pro quo for Italy, in the form of an understanding that France will not oppose Mr Prodi's candidacy for the commission's presidency. 
But whoever takes over at the commission will have to gird himself (no she is in sight) for a tricky few years. It is an increasingly awkward outfit to run; power is drifting away from it. One practical inconvenience is a top-heavy structure brought about by the EU'S growth from six to 15 members. This already means an unwieldy ""college"" of 20 commissioners jostling for portfolios. A dozen more countries want to join the EU in the next few years. 
Any worthwhile reform will probably mean creating a hierarchy with a few ""super-commissioners"" on top and the rest as deputies or department heads beneath them. But how does one sell that idea to the countries that fail to get a super-commissioner of their own? How does one arrange for the top tier to be chosen on merit, and not by a lottery or quota system? Such internal issues will dog and may even consume the next presidential term. 
The next president will also find other institutions eroding the commission's power and influence. The parliament is one. National governments are another: politicians have mastered the possibilities of European integration to the point at which they, and not the commission, have become the real agenda-setters. Mr Lafontaine has shown as much in the case of tax harmonisation. The launch of the euro has also changed the balance of power profoundly. The Union's economic centre has become the new European Central Bank, which owes the commission no obedience whatsoever. 
The commission is about to be left on the margins of another new project: the development of a common foreign and security policy. The main role here will be played by a new ""high representative"", likely also to be named at the Cologne summit. (Delays on the part of France and others in ratifying the Amsterdam treaty, which provides the legal basis for an Eu foreign-policy apparatus, prevented a high representative from being chosen at the Vienna summit in December.) 
The new high representative will be accountable not to the commission, but to national governments grouped together in the Eu's Council of Ministers. Dick Spring, a former Irish foreign minister, is one plausible candidate. So too is Carlos Westendorp, a Spaniard who has been representing the West in Bosnia. 
It sounds an attractive job. When the world wants to know what ""Europe"" thinks about the latest crisis, the high rep will pop up on television to explain. If the European Parliament has its way, he will be the Union's champion of human rights. One day he may even have some real muscle at his disposal, if governments agree to give the Union more of a say in Europe's defence. 
Contrast that with the lot of Mr Santer's successor, who will have parliament breathing down his neck, the central bank refusing to catch his eye, and the foreign-policy figure treading all over his toes. As the heads of government deliberate over which grandee might be juggled into the commission, anyone whose name is being tossed into the air would be wise to wonder whether that prize is really the one worth having.  1999 Tony Blair insists that there is no comparison between the rows that forced Peter Mandelson and Geoffrey Robinson to resign and the ""sleaze"" scandals that bedevilled the Major government. Is he right? 
FROM the moment that Peter Mandelson resigned from his job as trade and industry secretary on December 23rd, the Labour government has been engaged in a frenzied exercise in damage limitation. The Mandelsonian misjudgment was to accept a 373,ooo ($630,ooo) loan from Geoffrey Robinson, a rich colleague, and then to keep it secret-even when his department was investigating Mr Robinson's business affairs. According to the Blairites, this is quite, quite different from the sleaze that engulfed the Tories. 
Does Labour protest too much? The various scandals that have so far beset Labour combine many of the elements that damaged the Tories (see box) But Labour argue that Tory scandals contained an extra ingredient-outright corruption. The most famous of these was the ""cash-for-questions"" scandal, in which some Tory Mps accepted money in return for asking questions in Parliament. This was certainly blatant misconduct, but Mr Mandelson's sin, too, was a huge conflict of interest. And Mr Mandelson is a much more central figure in the Labour government than any of the Tories caught up in the cash-for-questions affair-who had heard of Tim Smith, or Sir Michael Grylls or Neil Hamilton (who still denies the charges)? 
The sheer quantity of Tory scandal was also impressive. Twelve ministers were forced to resign over various misdeeds; and there were numerous indiscretions from backbench MPs, ranging from affairs with night-club hostesses to dubious business dealings. But even here Labour is doing its best. In the five years of the Major government, two cabinet ministers were forced to resign-the Blair administration has equalled that in a year and a half 
SEX Of the 12 ministerial resignations under the Major government, five were related to sexual behaviour. David Mellor (right) was the first of two cabinet ministers to go. Although the allegations that finally finished him off related to his acceptance of ""foreign hospitality"", it was lurid headlines about an affair (toe-sucking with an actress) that first put him on the ropes. A rash of other stories about Tories with mistresses or strange sexual tastes was especially damaging since Mr Major had championed traditional morality. Tony Blair's first cabinet casualty, Ron Davies (left), who resigned as Welsh secretary in October, was also brought down by sex. He was mugged after apparently cruising for gay sex in a London park. In the subsequent row two other cabinet ministers including Peter Mandelson were revealed to be homosexual. 
COVER-UP The other cabinet minister to resign during the Major years was Jonathan Aitken (right) He resigned to sue the Guardian newspaper after it alleged that he had allowed Saudi businessmen to pay for him to stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, whilst he was minister for defence procurement. Mr Aitken lost his libel action and now faces charges of perjury: Mr Mandelson's conflict of interest was initially much less obvious; he accepted a loan from Geoffrey Robinson when both men were still in opposition. It was only when his department began to investigate Mr Robinson's business affairs that trouble loomed. But while Mr Mandelson may not have lied, he did dissemble. He failed to tell the senior civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry of his obligation to Mr Robinson; he fobbed off journalists who asked him how he could afford to buy his house; and he seems to have failed to tell the Britannia Building Society, from which he obtained a mortgage, about the loan from Mr Robinson. 
AND INFLUENCE PEDDLING Much of the aura of sleaze that surrounded the Tory party arose from its habit of accepting large, often secret, donations from dubious characters and foreigners. Asil Nadir (right), a businessman who subsequently fled Britain to avoid prosecution, donated f440,000 to the Tories; and the family of Ma Sikchun, who fled Hong Kong to avoid drug-running charges, also stumped up f im. But neither of these men bought immunity; Mr Nadir is still a fugitive and the Ma family accused the Tories of ""swindling"" them because charges against the senior Ma were not dropped. Labour's biggest funding scandal has centred on a respectable businessmanBernie Ecclestone (left), who runs Formula One motor racing. Unlike Messrs Ma and Nadir, Mr Ecclestone arguably got something for his Im donation. Shortly after the election the Blair government deferred plans to ban tobacco-advertising in motor racing.  1999 The economy 
Why are British interest rates so much higher than Europe's and America's? 
THREE cuts in interest rates, totalling 1.25 percentage points, brought some cheer to British borrowers in the last three months of 1998. But not all that much. Britain's official interest rates, at 6.25%, remain the highest of any large rich country (see chart on next page). America's Federal Funds rate is 4.75% and the eleven European countries adopting the euro will share a common official rate of a mere 3%. 
Yet Britain begins 1999 with the weakest economy in this group, except Japan's, according to the panel of forecasters polled monthly by The Economist. Indeed, a growing number of economists expect a recession. So why are British interest rates so much higher than those in America and euroland? The simplest answer is that the goal of central bankers is to achieve price stability, and that despite the relative weakness of the economy the Bank of England is still more worried than monetary authorities in other countries about inflation. 
The Bank's monetary-policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, has the explicit task of keeping ""RPIX"" inflation (ie, excluding mortgage-interest payments) at 2.5%. Throughout 1998, it fretted that Britain's labour market was tight. There is also the risk that sharper cuts in interest rates would weaken sterling, raising the inflation rate through higher import prices. The pound's 9% drop against the D-mark from its peak in March in effect eased monetary policy a little-the reverse of the role played before then by an appreciating pound. 
Indeed, inflation in Britain has remained higher than elsewhere. It is certainly remarkably low by the country's past standards, the more so after a long economic expansion. Currently RPIX inflation is 2.5%, on target. But American inflation, despite seven years of strong economic growth, is only 1.5%. In Germany, inflation is o.7% and in France a mere o.3%. 
International differences in current inflation rates, however, explain less than you might think. Even by the standards of economic data, they are imprecise, thanks to differences in the measurement of inflation. America's inflation rate has been trimmed by statistical refinements in recent years far more than has Britain's. And on the Eu-wide harmonised index of consumer prices, the gap between British inflation and those of France and Germany is smaller than on national measures. The British rate is 1.4%, compared with 0.2% in France, o.6% in Germany and an average of o.9% in the euro-11. 
More important, however, current inflation rates matter far less to monetarypolicy makers than does expected inflation. The MPC, for example, sets rates with an eye to hitting its target two years ahead. So the nz PC must believe that deeper cuts in interest rates would have risked pushing inflation above target in two years' time. 
There is, however, another possible reason why the Bank has not gone further in cutting rates: inertia. Financial markets see few inflationary dangers in Britain: tenyear government-bond yields are within a point of France's and Germany's, and below America's. In effect, the Mpc has already revised its expectation of inflation, and reduced rates accordingly, three times in the past three months. Most economists expect more revisions in the months ahead. 
In a recent lecture Charles Goodhart, a member of the MPC, argued that central banks were slow to react to changes in economic events, preferring to cut rates in small steps. They were also, he said, sometimes loth to move rates for fear of having to change their minds later. Yet in 1998 America's Federal Reserve cut rates as the global economic weather darkened, even though the domestic economy was still growing healthily. Europe's central bankers surprised the markets by cutting rates last month. Either or both may turn out to have been too eager. Should Britain's central bankers also have been bolder? 
Perhaps; and they might yet be. Most economists expect more rate cuts soon (even if not at the MPC'S next meeting on January 6th-7th). And there is an intriguing discussion in the minutes of last month's gathering, published on December 23rd. Some committee members thought it ""useful"" to consider a ""neutral"" interest rate, which would neither slow the economy nor expand it. Such a rate, they suggested, could lie anywhere between 4.5% and 6.5%-ie, the sum of expected inflation of about 2.5% and a real interest rate of between 2% and 4%. 
Others on the committee think the idea bunk, or at any rate too imprecise to be much use. How should the neutral rate vary with the exchange rate, say? Nonetheless it is noteworthy that British rates are still near the top of this ""neutral"" range with the economy on the edge of recession. Time to draw closer to both Europe and America?  1999 John Prescott needs to sharpen the financial incentives of Britain's privatised rail companies to stop passengers being taken for a ride 
THE ultimatum given to passenger-railway operators to improve their services or face the loss or curtailment of their franchises expires next month. Despite such threats made by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, there are few signs of improvement. 
Extensive engineering works by Railtrack made travel over the Christmas and new year holiday period a nightmare. With punctuality declining and overcrowding worsening, passenger complaints continue to rise. 
All this poses a problem for Mr Prescott. He began a recent meeting with train operators by pointing out that for the past 18 months he had been able to blame the Tories. The next scapegoats were the train companies, good for perhaps another six months. But after that, he bellowed, ""the shit falls on me."" 
The deputy prime ministers dilemma can be summed up briefly. Does he return to a centrally run railway by imposing much tougher regulation on Railtrack and the train-operating companies? Or is he prepared to allow high profits in return for high levels of investment? The rail structure he inherited means that this choice cannot be delayed much longer. The appointment of the chairman of a new strategic railway authority, to be announced later this month, may provide a clue. Among those shortlisted is Sir Alastair Morton, whose record as Eurotunnel co-chairman shows that he can both knock heads and oversee high-risk operations. 
The Conservatives privatised the railways hurriedly and on the cheap. Though there was nominally a quality threshold, the successful train operators were those submitting the lowest bids for subsidy. As a result, Treasury support for the railways by 2oo4 will be about half the level prior to privatisation. That imposes a squeeze which requires rapid growth in passenger revenues as well as stringent cost cutting. The consequence has been overcrowding and declining punctuality. The task of delivering a satisfactory service is complicated by the split between track and train operations with both sides blaming one another for poor performance. 
The train operators claim that privatising the rail network as a monopoly has given disproportionate power to Railtrack. Shareholders' interests, they complain, have taken precedence over levels of investment, noting that the company's share price has quadrupled since privatisation. 
Railtrack, for its part, points out that it has improved its punctuality and reliability by 45% over the past four years while that of the train operators has deteriorated. Its chief executive, Gerald Corbett, argues persuasively that blame for poor performance is at least in part due to the misalignment of financial incentives. Railtrack, he points out, gains only marginally from increased fare revenues, thus minimising its incentive to invest. The train operators, on the other hand, have benefited so much from passenger growth that financial penalties for poor running have become insignificant. 
The first serious shot in this war was fired by the acting rail regulator, Chris Bolt, last month. Supporting complaints that Railtrack was investing insufficiently to justify its current high rates of return, he threatened to cap the fees it charges train operators for the use of its track. Railtrack immediately retaliated, saying that, if its profits were capped, this would have an immediate impact on its ability to raise capital. ""The key is getting new equity,"" says Mr Corbett. ""Our share price should be regarded as an asset rather than a problem."" 
Railtrack has some strong cards to play in what will be a lengthy negotiation. It has a key role in building the Channel Tunnel fast rail link and it is also a leading contender to take over the infrastructure contract for London Underground. ""Railtrack is Prescott's white knight,"" commented an industry observer. ""He knows he won't get any money out of the Treasury."" 
The government, however, cannot afford to allow a privatised monopoly a soft ride. With passenger numbers growing at around 6% a year to nearly 85om, the need to accelerate investment in track and rolling stock is urgent. Many commuter and peak-hour inter-city routes are now so crowded that passengers are having to stand for long periods, blocking any movement along the train. 
Railtrack says there are at least 30 serious congestion points in the network. This squeeze on capacity explains why punctuality and overcrowding are getting worse. But so far the company has been reluctant to commit itself to dealing with these bottlenecks, blaming the lack of incentives in its regulatory regime. 
In part, current problems are the problems of success. Train operators are running 1,ooo extra services a day while the number of passenger journeys has increased by nearly 100m in the past two years. Railtrack and the train operators are winning back custom from the roads. The question is: will they continue to do so, or will their squabbling bring Britain's rail revival to a screeching halt?  1999 MANY a marriage has come to grief even before the wedding day, as the happy couple and their families squabble over who to invite to the ceremony and the reception; over who will sit where; and over the choice and the cost of dresses, flowers, limousines, food, drinks and photographers. No wonder that increasing numbers of couples choose to get hitched in an exotic place far, far away from their relatives. 
No official figures are kept on the numbers marrying abroad. But Mintel, a market-research firm, estimates that in 1997 around 17,ooo couples went abroad to tie the knot. If so, that is one in 20 of all marriages of British residents. 
Exotic wedding-cum-honeymoon trips have become big earners for the travel trade: the Association of British Travel Agents' website lists 54 firms which claim expertise in arranging weddings abroad. Marrying at a Caribbean beach-side hotel is the most popular choice, though the weddings brochure of Airtours, Britain's second-largest tour operator, also offers the chance to exchange vows on a Canadian ski slope or in an underground cavern in Barbados. 
Whereas a traditional wedding back home typically costs at least L100,000 ($16,900) an exotic wedding abroad can be had for a supplement of a few hundred pounds on top of the cost of the honeymoon package tour. Often, the travel firm throws in many of the usual trimmings, such as a wedding cake and a bottle of bubbly, as well as some unusual ones: couples booking Airtours' wedding package in Jamaica get a massage and a ""commemorative T-shirt""; those choosing to wed at Disney World in Florida get their marriage certificate signed by Mickey and Minnie Mouse. 
To Richard Lampard, a sociologist at Warwick University who studies marriage, it is all part of a trend over several decades in which marriage has ceased to be a ""public institution"" and is now seen as simply a private contract between two people. The wedding ceremony itself is no longer regarded as the ""property"" of the local community in whose midst it is carried out. Increasingly, couples are marrying in their late twenties and paying for the wedding themselves, which means they are more likely to withstand family pressure to do things the traditional way-or to invite Auntie Maude.  1999 IT IS hard to sum up pithily the complex mixture of emotions generated by the dramatic Christmas resignation of Peter Mandelson, one of the chief architects of New Labour, secretary of state for trade and industry, and probably the most interesting (""exotic"" is his own word) man in Tony Blair's cabinet. It is hard, but it is not impossible. Bagehot's impression is that the reaction of many people-and certainly of most of political London-to the rude interruption of this gifted man's sparkling career can be broadly summarised as hahahahah. 
There is seldom a good reason to find pleasure in the misfortune of others. But there can be better reasons and worse reasons. In the case of Mr Mandelson's secret L373,000 ($630,000) loan from Geoffrey Robinson, the paymaster general, people need to sort out exactly what it is that they find so funny. The list is not comprehensive, but here, in descending order of acceptability, are four different flavours of hahahahah. 
It would be consoling to think that the most prevalent sort of hahahahah was the most highminded one, the one that says: ""This is a man who behaved dishonourably and was caught out."" Surely nobody can believe that anything other than self-preservation prevented Mr Blair's most intimate counsellor from telling the prime minister about his vast personal debt to Mr Robinson, once the paymaster general had become the subject of an investigation by Mr Mandelson's own department? Well, the peculiar thing is that some people-Mr Blair included-say not only that they believe him but have chosen to shower him with praise for having reluctantly resigned. And the depressing thing is that most of the people who do not believe him seem to be saying hahahahah for a different reason. 
This second sort of hahahahah has something to do with Greek tragedy. It is a not especially admirable human reaction to a tale of human frailty. Every so often it becomes the fate of a politician to prove all over again the adage that pride comes before a fall. Mr Mandelson was the perfect candidate. If, still knowing nothing about the secret loan he took from Mr Robinson, you had been asked in some pre-Christmas quiz to nominate a prominent member of the present government as a great man ripe for laying low, you would probably have selected Mr Mandelson. Famous for the exquisite sensitivity of his political antennae, he nonetheless made the elementary mistake of letting it be known that he considered himself very great indeed. Here was a man who made friends with Elisabeth Murdoch and Prince Charles but also made the nursing of grievances, the intimidation of journalists and the snubbing of the lowly into something akin to an art form. It is hardly high-minded, but perhaps not so terrible-and (be generous to yourself) maybe even healthy for democracy-to feel, instinctively: ""Hahahahah. He puffed himself up and was overdue for a comeuppance."" 
The third flavour of hahahahah holds some danger for British politics. This is the one that says: ""We knew all along that nothing good would come of this New Labour malarkey."""" Tories say this because Labour mounted a high horse and exaggerated the sleaze of John Major's government. But many traditional Labour people are saying it too, because they dislike many of the aspects of New Labour that Mr Mandelson came to symbolise. How delicious, they say, and how apt, that Mr Mandelson's fatal flaw was a craving to live beyond his means in a posh house at a fashionable address in London. This was the smart cosmopolitan who folded up the red flag and put a red rose in its place, who saw nothing wrong in people becoming ""filthy rich"", and who poked fun last summer at the idea that Labour owed a special debt to ""horny-handed, dirty-overalled people"". Well, just as Mr Mandelson did himself no good by putting himself in hock to the (filthy-rich) Mr Robinson, sohahahahah-no good will come from New Labour continuing to snub the trade unions and cosy up to big business. 
But this reaction has a fatal flaw of its own. It is at the very least based on a non-sequitur. In the matter of his house and loan, Mr Mandelson undoubtedly made a serious mistake. The man may be discredited, his style may be objectionable. But the policies with which he became associated-an end to class war, support for competition and flexible labour markets-have not been discredited at all. On the contrary. New Labour would not have won the last election if it had not ditched the discredited Old Labour ideas which those who rejoice in the exit of Mr Mandelson now see a chance to promote all over again. There are few such people within the government itself, but there are some. In his first interview after Mr Mandelson's resignation, Mr Blair made a point of warning potential revisionists that New Labour was bigger than any individual, and would resist any return to old policies. 
The Tories would love Labour to reopen these battles. One Tory spokesman claimed reports of a new alliance of pro-spending Keynesians between John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Gordon Brown, the chancellor, as evidence of the return of ideology to what had so far just been ""intense personal loathing"" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. But this is wishful thinking on the Tories' part. Both Mr Brown and Mr Prescott see themselves as signed-up members of New Labour. Pardon the understatement, but they just don't like Mr Mandelson. 
And that, by the way, is the fourth flavour of hahahahah. It is the reaction of a handful of ministers and their spin doctors who continue to snipe at one another for no better reason than personal rivalry, and who say: ""Hahahahah, our enemy has fallen."" It is the unfunniest hahahahah of all.  1999 Northem Italy is studded with thriving clusters of manufacturing businesses. Why are they so vigorous? 
BEAUTIFULLY made goods from northern Italy are a part of la dolce vita from Hollywood to Hong Kong. Silk from Como, wool from Biella and gold from Vicenza adorn the fashionable, while on their noses perch glasses shaped and polished in the Dolomites. Ferrari, Ducati and Alfa Romeo are northern Italian names to quicken a motorist's heart. Tiles from Modena grace the grandest kitchens, and in those kitchens the famous cheese of Parma is grated on pasta prepared in the city's factories. 
These glamorous consumer industries are sustained by a second, less visible layer of activity. It consists of the firms that make the machines that make the famous products. Italy's group of machine-tool manufacturers, the bottom layer of the manufacturing pyramid, is the fourth-largest in the world after Japan's, Germany's and America's, with sales of $3.45 billion in 1997. Individual Italian machine makers tend to be small. The average size of the workforce in Italy's 450 machine-tool firms is 70, compared with 200 in Germany's 320 firms. According to Mario Fochi, of Sperotto Rimar, which makes textile-finishing machines, machinery makers spring up around the manufacturing firms like mushrooms amid the roots of big trees. 
Such delicacies are much sought-after among business theorists these days. Excited by the crackling commercial energy of Silicon Valley in California, governments around the world have tried to create their own Silicon Glens, Fens and Parks, Bio Valleys and Villes. They offer cheap buildings, infrastructure and tax breaks as a lure to entrepreneurs. The aim is to boost the productivity and creativity of everyone in the cluster by fostering opportunities for collaboration and the exchange of information, and a critical mass of expertise. 
Something in the air 
Northern Italy's long-standing clusters are proof of the value of collaboration. Elena Ferraro of IECO, which makes machines for melting and electroforming gold, underlines the importance of exchanging information with her customers. Of the firm's sales, 60% are within Italy. Most of those are of customised machines, rather than the off-the-shelf models and complete turn-key factories that IECO sells abroad. The need to keep up with the demands of the more sophisticated Italian goldsmiths has enabled Italian suppliers such as IECO, and nearby Sisma, to dominate their business, supplying about 80% of the total world market for machinery for making gold jewellery. 
Yet northern Italian clusters also contain a more surprising ingredient: the collaborators increasingly compete as well. Easier communications and trade mean that both manufacturers and machinery suppliers can more easily deal with each other's rivals across the world. 
The great fear among Italian industrialists is that this will weaken the country's clusters. Rather than use machines that might be sold to their competitors, some bigger firms prefer to rely on equipment from in-house workshops. Barilla, the world's largest pasta maker, has a 100strong engineering division. Proprietary machines propel every stage of its new lasagne line in Parma, from the floppy curtains of fresh dough dropping on to conveyors to the dealer that stacks the cut, dried sheets like so many playing cards. More important is the computer system the company has designed to control the line. Necessity has been the mother of some of this invention, for Barilla's dominance of its home market-it has 32%, compared with 4.8% for its nearest rival-means it operates on a larger scale than others, giving it needs that cannot be met with standard equipment. 
Other large firms are all too aware that their secrets would be at risk if the machines they use were widely available. Safilo, the second-biggest manufacturer of spectacles in the Veneto, with a turnover of 566 billion lire ($345m) in 1997, also has a research division. Fifty engineers design and build the machines that are humming away in the factory next door. Some of the systems developed within Safilo's workshop are patented-machinery to construct a particularly flexible hinge, for example. More often, the engineers modify standard machines that Safilo buys from outside. Vittorio Tabacchi, the chairman, laughs at the idea of asking the company's suppliers to modify the machines they sell him: that would reveal his firm's secrets and allow them to fall into the hands of competitors. 
Smaller firms do not have the luxury of using machines that are not sold to foreign competitors. Sperotto Rimar, Mr Fochi's firm, sprouted originally because of the sustaining presence in the region of Marzotto and Lanerossi, two textile firms that some 150 years ago found in the steep hills north of Vicenza fast-flowing streams to drive their looms, and sheep to provide wool. 
Today these two firms are one, which gets its wool from Australia and its power from the national grid, and its boss chafes at the restrictions a narrow valley places on floor space in his factory. The machinery in that factory comes from suppliers in other countries as well as its neighbourslooms from Switzerland, bobbin-winders from Germany, washing machines from Britain. Equally, 9o% of Mr Fochi's steam presses and shrinking machines go abroad-up from 6o% in 1985. Many go to Marzotto's growing number of rivals in Asia. Nuovo Pignone, a nearby loom maker that also supplies Marzotto, sold 7o% of its output in 1997 in Asia (and itself is being bought by a Swiss competitors 
Yet the increasing foreign trade also provides things that are good for clusters. Sisma, the world's largest producer of machines used to make gold chains, received 80% of its 30 billion lire ($18m) turnover from exports in 1997. ""Some Italian jewellery firms are unhappy that we sell machinery to their foreign competitors. But if we didn't, others would,"" reasons Fiorenzo Sbabo, Sisma's chairman. 
In this way, international sales prevent would-be foreign competitors from emerging. At the same time, the threat is a stimulus for innovation and the desire to move constantly upmarket. Italy has an edge in quality even in industries where other countries have obvious advantages. Its tile industry is one example (see box). Another is cashmere, which comes from China. Firms there have installed numerous Italian looms, as well as developing equipment of their own, but the finest cashmere clothes still come from Biella. The gap is narrowing, but Italy remains ahead. 
Similarly, South-East Asia dominates the mass market for spectacles, but Italy retains a lock on the top end of the market (where the profit margins are much greater: cheap glasses cost $4 to make and may sell for $15; designer glasses cost $12 and sell for $150). In gold jewellery, leather and tiles, likewise, Italy has hung on to the most lucrative part of the market, even as others have conquered its lower end. 
New technology has permitted the intimacy that used to be possible only within a cluster to take place over long distances. As a result, foreign customers have become a source of feedback in their own right. Flavio Radice, the boss of Pietro Carnaghi, a tool maker in Busto Arsizio, north of Milan, says he and his designers regularly use their video-telephone link to pore over plans with customers for the huge vertical-milling machines his firm makes for turbine builders. Some of these customers are to be found just up the road, part of the dense engineering conglomeration of this most industrious of towns, but others, such as Boeing Aerospace, for which Pietro Carnaghi has built a machine to shape the top of Delta-4 rockets, are in America. 
Nonetheless, there is an advantage in being local. Mr Radice's firm has built a suite of offices complete with a shower alongside its workshop. Customers like to come and spend several weeks consulting with the firm's engineers as their machines take shape. Being there still matters.  1999 TORTELLINI and Lambrusco pushed aside the usual machines and cutting oil last November when LB Officine Meccaniche celebrated 25 years of building machinery for making ceramic tiles at its factory on the outskirts of Sassuolo. There was every excuse for a blow-out: the firm's fortunes have risen with those of the Italian tile industry, which produced 572m square metres in 1997, compared with only 200m square metres in 1973. Over the same period exports have risen too, from 30% to 70% of total production. By egging each other on, both the tile makers and the machinery makers such as LB Officine Meccaniche that cluster together in Sassuo(o's ""tile valley"" have given themselves much to celebrate. 
Success has depended on innovation. LB Officine Meccaniche, for example, has developed systems for handling and mixing materials to make porcelain tiles that look like marble and granite, but are lighter and cheaper than the real thing. Tile makers elsewhere are catching up with the Italians. Ten years ago Spain's production was only one half that of Italy; now it is almost as large. Turkey's production is growing rapidly, and China's is already as large as Italy's. To stay ahead, the Italians must continue to innovatethe pressing concerns today are to reduce fragility and to make elaborate shapes in large quantities-in order to add more value to what is at bottom nothing more than cooked mud. 
Whether Italian tile makers can keep innovating is another matter. After the party, the strains of cluster life soon resurface. Angelo Bore]li, chairman of Assopiastrelle, the tile makers' trade association, says that his members and the machinery makers have a love-hate relationship. He complains that machinery makers sell foreign clients expertise that they acquired through their work in Italy. ""[We] would be much better off if the machines were not sold abroad,"" he grumbles. 
Nearly three-quarters of the machinery makers' 1997 turnover came from exports, with almost one-third going to Asia. But tile makers are getting their own back: problems in Asia have brought harder times for the machinery makers and, according to Filippo Marazzi, chairman of the Marazzi Group, Italy's top tile maker, a chance for their customers to buy cheaply by playing off suppliers against each other. 
Ivanno Ligabue, one of the founders of LB Officine Meccaniche, is uneasy for the region's future. He doubts that tile makers are doing enough to create new products and market them. But out of such insecurity the next wave of innovation is born.  1999 WITH a record like his, there is every reason to think that Lord Simpson, the managing director of Britain's General Electric Company(GEc, will play a big role in the reshaping of Europe's defence industry. Not that he entertains many grand designs himself he wants to pair off his Marconi defence arm with one of four potential partners, two of them in Europe, and two in America. 
When Lord Simpson was boss of Rover, the last big car company in British hands was clinging to life with the help of Japan's Honda, which owned a zoo% stake in the ailing but venerable firm. With a refreshing lack of sentimentality, he sold it to a German firm, BMW, before going on to run Lucas, a British car-parts company. Ere long that too went-to America's Varity. 
True to form, just before Christmas, Lord Simpson confirmed, in effect, that he was proceeding with the dismemberment of GEC, another British industrial institution, which had been built lovingly over 30 years by Lord Weinstock, who was one of the country's most respected industrialists. Lord Simpson had already floated the group's power-engineering joint venture, Alstom. His next move will be to split the civil and military sides of Marconi, its electronics and communications subsidiary, the better to sell or merge Marconi's main defence business. 
At the last count, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in America, and British Aerospace (sae) and Thomson-csF (French despite the name), were all in discussion with GEC The company confirmed just before the end of 1998 that a deal should be announced in January. 
Lord Simpson is lucky to be in a sellers market. Americans are interested because GEC is respected as a supplier to the Pentagon, and recently snapped up a smallish American company, Tracor, to strengthen its American business. Meanwhile, the European defence industry is poised for rationalisation, so that it can compete better with American giants such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Closest to tying the knot are sAe and DASA, the aerospace part of DaimlerChrysler. 
In many ways Lord Simpson might find a merger with Lockheed easiest, building on GEC'S good reputation in America. Or he could seek to become the third leg in the sae/DAsA group, but this would probably have to wait some time until the first two arranged their own deal and worked out a way for GEC to join without turning DASA into the junior partner. A third option would be to join Thomson, which the French government wants to strengthen and privatise. A Marconi-Thomson link-up would create a new powerful defence-electronics company every bit as prestigious as the sAe/DAsA group (which makes the aeroplane platforms that carry the military electronics). 
Whichever Lord Simpson chooses, he will be left with the rump of the industrial and consumer businesses of GEc-which includes such things as weighing machines, telecoms equipment, domestic appliances and medical devices. He would be unlikely to use them as a base for building a GEC Mark Two. So expect rather more disposals and handing back of cash to shareholders. Would the last person to leave GEC please turn out the lights.  1999 South Korean restructuring 
EVEN those who are leery of politicians meddling in industry sense a certain justice in the dressing down that South Korea's government is giving its giant conglomerates, or chaebol. Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's president, is not alone when he blames the chaebol's huge debts and overweening expansion for his country's eceonomic crisis. Yet, however much the chaebol need reining in, President Kim's row with the LG Group appears to be a miscalculation. On December 28th the government cancelled new loans to LG. If it were to go further and call in debts worth $5.6 billion, as it has threatened, it would destroy the firm. And to what end? 
The fight is over the government's plan for LG to merge its semiconductor operations with those of Hyundai. There is an arbitrary, almost numerological, dimension to this-as there is to Mr Kim's other industrial designs. Instead of three main chaebol in most big industries, the government wants two, with the weakest handing its operations to one of the stronger two. 
Ultimately, Mr Kim's aim is to lower the chaebol's soaring debts and to reduce overcapacity. The top five chaebol have already agreed to lower their average ratio of debt to equity to 200% by the end of 1999, from nearly 400% today. Not content for the chaebol to do this in their own fashion, the government is directing the restructuring with enforced swaps, which have come to be known as ""big deals"". With LG refusing to do Mr Kim's bidding, the president is using the state-controlled banking system to starve the chaebol of money. 
Sometimes, as with Samsung's car plant, born ofthe company's mis-timed entry into the car industry in 1998, the rationale for restructuring seems justified, even if the method is heavy-handed. (Samsung agreed to hand the plant to Daewoo in exchange for some second-rate consumerelectronics operations.) But the deal between LG and Hyundai does not even have the advantage of industrial logic 
The argument for the merger rests on the current overcapacity in memory-chip making-the plunging price of which in 6 caused the losses that first harmed the chaebol. Memory-chip making is a cyclical industry. Those that can afford to invest in new technology through the down cycles stand to make huge profits when prices rise. To prosper, therefore, all three South Korean chipmakers (including Samsung, the leader) need to invest huge amounts in 1999 (see chart), which will mean borrowing billions of dollars just when they are supposed to be lowering their debt. The government thinks one big firm formed out of the two smallest (together, iG and Hyundai would be the world's largest memory-chip producer) would enjoy economies of scale. The government hopes that it may also attract a foreign investor, which could take up to a 50% stake and help finance the new investment. 
When the government first dreamed up this scheme in September, LG and Hyundai unenthusiastically agreed, hoping they could find a way to scotch it. But the government pressed on, proposing a 70-30 jointly owned firm, with Hyundai holding the controlling share. When LG demurred, the government asked Arthur D. Little to study the question. After the consultancy confirmed the governments view, LG threatened to sue it. 
Arthur D. Little argues that, because the memory industry is so capital intensive, only the richest firms can survive. ""Secondtier companies like LG and Hyundai are very vulnerable to downturns,"" the firm says; ""Put LG and Hyundai together and they become top-tier almost overnight."" 
In fact the deal makes little sense. It is anyone's guess whether a merger will really do much to make investment more affordable. Bigger, financially sound companies do have access to cheaper capital, which is indeed a competitive advantage in memory-chip making. Yet the combined company would still have far heavier debts than chipmakers elsewhere. The government may force the banks to forgive much of this debt (swapping it for equity, for instance), but it could just as easily do this for the two firms separately. In any case, neither LG nor Hyundai is a tiddler even now, with 12-13% ofthe world memory-chip market each-more than their Taiwanese rivals. 
There may be modest savings in research spending, but the two firms specialise in different types of memory chip. The combined firm would presumably continue to invest in both. Their factories also use different technologies that cannot easily be integrated. And, as ING Barings, an investment bank, points out, a firm the size of the combined LG-Hyundai may be less likely to attract a large foreign investor. Buying a half-share of such a giant would be too expensive for most of the firms that are likley to be interested (Intel, the obvious exception, has already joined Micron, an American memory maker). 
The pity is that South Korea already has rules that could sort out chip making and most other industries without Mr Kim's good offices. The government has banned the sort of loans between subsidiaries that LG and Hyundai used to help get through rough patches in the past. Under the new restrictions, the credit market could determine which operations should merge or close. Could it be that Mr Kim is unwilling to see the lay-offs that would result from such spontaneous restructuring?  1999 BY ADDING an inch to every Chinese shirt-tail, Britain hoped to keep its t9th-century textile mills running. It failed, but the promise of 1.2 billion consumers still lures traders to China. Most are disappointed: China is still largely rural and achingly poor-the average income is just $360 per head a year. 
Yet the rise of an urban economic elite, mobile telephones in hand, proves that there are two Chinas: the huge nation of poor peasants who may never buy a Coke, and a thin layer of free-spending officials, managers and entrepreneurs who are only too keen to splash out. Affluent China today probably amounts to a small nation, barely significant in the global consumer market-but growing too quickly to be ignored. 
It is easy to overestimate the buying power of China's elite consumers. Together they represent no more than 3om people in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. And for the most part, they are not rich by world standards: according to the latest official government survey, the top lo% of city dwellers have an average annual disposable income of just $1,24o a person. 
On the other hand, if GDP per head is adjusted for purchasing power, the incomes of the top io% of city dwellers is probably closer to $io,ooo a year. The prevalence of wide-screen televisions, fancy stereos and home-karaoke machines in Shanghai apartments suggests that this new upper-middle class has more money than it admits to. Supposing that the real wealth of affluent Chinese lies somewhere between the two estimates, China's potential market must be somewhere between those of Belgium and Australia. 
Put like that, China looks hefty, but not gigantic. But compare China today with China in 1985 (the first year the country conducted comprehensive consumer surveys) and it is clear that China's growth has been rapid. 
Among urban households, fewer than one in five households had a colour television in 1985; today the average such home has more than one. Then, 7% had a refrigerator; now 73% do. Cameras are four times more common. Among richer urban households, more than a half now have a VCR or video CD machine, a pager, air-conditioner and shower, and nearly a third of homes also own a mobile telephone. Every year, millions more Chinese join the ranks of this high-spending elite. 
After three years of declining growth rates (from an unsustainable peak of 4o% a year in 1995), consumer spending started picking up again in 1998 and should come close to matching the country's 7.8% growth in GDP for the year. China is already one of the largest markets for mobile telephones and pagers, personal computers and antibiotics, and accounts for about one-third of global cigarette consumption. All of these industries make lots of money for foreign firms. In boom towns such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, BMWS and Mercedes are now commonplace: after decades of deprivation, the urge to splurge is strong.  1999 SLOVAKIA has not had much to boast of in recent years, but it may produce the biggest corporate default in Central Europe since the collapse of communism. Creditor banks have spent the past few weeks shuffling the management of vsz, Central Europe's largest steelworks, and trying to reach a deal to restructure its debts. The company defaulted in November on a $35m loan arranged by Merrill Lynch, and it is reckoned to have further debts of around $45om that it cannot service. If there is no progress within the coming months, it will go under. 
This mess need not have come about. vsz, which accounts for 8% of Slovak GDP and 14% of Slovak exports, enjoys strong local demand from the booming Central European car industry. Daewoo and Volkswagen, whose Czech Skoda subsidiary is vsz's largest customer, need a range of specialist steels which vsz could be supplying. Although vsz is being undercut in western markets by producers in Asia and the former Soviet Union, in Central Europe it has geography on its side. 
But politics has undermined vsz's business. The usual post-communist problems of overmanning and slack management were exacerbated in 1995 when the company was sold for a fifth of its market value to supporters of the thuggish Vladimir Meciar, who was ousted as prime minister in October 1998. The largest shareholder is now Alexander Rezes, who handed management control to his son in order to run Mr Meciar's re-election campaign. Jan Smerek, head of the supervisory board, is a member of parliament in Mr Meciar's leftwing populist party. He led attempts to put together another Meciar government. 
Instead of investing in vsz's run-down plant, Mr Rezes decided that it needed to diversify away from steel. He bought a heap of companies including a financial newspaper, a football club and some holiday homes in Spain. Fortunately, his attempts to buy Slovakia's largest insurer and thirdlargest bank came to nothing. 
vsz is nowa large political constituency as well as a huge chunk of the economy. It directly employs 25,ooo people, and supports three times that number through its supply chain. Sean Murphy, a steel analyst at Nomura, an investment bank, reckons that the company needs only a quarter of its present workforce. But, he says, ""the company is being run for the benefit of its employees, not its shareholders."" 
When the new government came to power in October, it offered to rescue vsz if the management and supervisory board resigned. They refused. But now that the company faces bankruptcy, they have accepted some changes. Just before Christmas the creditors kicked out Rezesfils and put in two American managers, including Thomas Graham, the ""smiling barracuda"" who has a record of turning around steel mills. What next? Simplest would be to sell the plant to a western firm with plenty of cash and no political agenda.  1999 SLOVAKIA has not had much to boast of in recent years, but it may produce the biggest corporate default in Central Europe since the collapse of communism. Creditor banks have spent the past few weeks shuffling the management of vsz, Central Europe's largest steelworks, and trying to reach a deal to restructure its debts. The company defaulted in November on a $35m loan arranged by Merrill Lynch, and it is reckoned to have further debts of around $45om that it cannot service. If there is no progress within the coming months, it will go under. 
This mess need not have come about. vsz, which accounts for 8% of Slovak GDP and 14% of Slovak exports, enjoys strong local demand from the booming Central European car industry. Daewoo and Volkswagen, whose Czech Skoda subsidiary is vsz's largest customer, need a range of specialist steels which vsz could be supplying. Although vsz is being undercut in western markets by producers in Asia and the former Soviet Union, in Central Europe it has geography on its side. 
But politics has undermined vsz's business. The usual post-communist problems of overmanning and slack management were exacerbated in 1995 when the company was sold for a fifth of its market value to supporters of the thuggish Vladimir Meciar, who was ousted as prime minister in October 1998. The largest shareholder is now Alexander Rezes, who handed management control to his son in order to run Mr Meciar's re-election campaign. Jan Smerek, head of the supervisory board, is a member of parliament in Mr Meciar's leftwing populist party. He led attempts to put together another Meciar government. 
Instead of investing in vsz's run-down plant, Mr Rezes decided that it needed to diversify away from steel. He bought a heap of companies including a financial newspaper, a football club and some holiday homes in Spain. Fortunately, his attempts to buy Slovakia's largest insurer and thirdlargest bank came to nothing. 
vsz is nowa large political constituency as well as a huge chunk of the economy. It directly employs 25,ooo people, and supports three times that number through its supply chain. Sean Murphy, a steel analyst at Nomura, an investment bank, reckons that the company needs only a quarter of its present workforce. But, he says, ""the company is being run for the benefit of its employees, not its shareholders."" 
When the new government came to power in October, it offered to rescue vsz if the management and supervisory board resigned. They refused. But now that the company faces bankruptcy, they have accepted some changes. Just before Christmas the creditors kicked out Rezesfils and put in two American managers, including Thomas Graham, the ""smiling barracuda"" who has a record of turning around steel mills. What next? Simplest would be to sell the plant to a western firm with plenty of cash and no political agenda.  1999 The British textile industry's close relationship with Marks and Spencer was once its salvation. Now it is proving to be its undoing 
BRITAIN'S textile industry is in a mess. Like many of the country's basic manufacturing industries, the textiles business is suffering from falling demand, volatile input prices and the strength of sterling. Much more startling is that a sweatshop industry should matter at all to Britain, one of the world's most developed economies. 
With a workforce of some 354,ooo, textiles and clothing is the sixth-largest employer in British manufacturing-just behind mechanical engineering. Britain and Italy are by far Europe's biggest employers in clothing manufacturing. Though many of its ii,ooo or so textile firms are small and family-run, Britain is also home to some of the publicly traded clothing manufacturers with the largest sales in Europe. 
All of them are having a miserable time. Share prices in the textiles sector have underperformed the -rsE 100 share index by some gn% in the past five years, let down by thinning margins and, in many cases, declining profits. In 1994 Coats Viyella, the largest, was one of the 1oo biggest quoted companies in Britain. On December 21st it suffered the indignity of being demoted from Britain's top 350 companies to its SmallCap Index. Today, the values of Britain's 3o-odd quoted textile firms combined would be less than half that needed to enter the ranking of the top too. 
And things are deteriorating. Clothing sales in Britain are flat and retailers fear that worse lies ahead. Britain's largest and most profitable retailer, Marks and Spencer, recently spoke of a ""bloodbath"" on the high streets. 
The plight of Britain's textile companies has much to do with nM&Ss. In most countries, clothing manufacturers are branded companies in their own right. Many have their own retail outlets-Benetton and Stefanel in Italy, Hugo Boss in Germany, Donna Karan and Tommy Hilfiger in America. In Britain, it is the clothing retailers-MeAS particularly-that enjoy brand status. Consumers shop for and trust in Mas clothes, whereas manufacturers remain faceless. To keep the British public loyal to its ""St Michael"" brand, Mas has tied its main suppliers to its apron strings, encouraging them to keep factories in Britain and to concentrate on supplying M&S. 
There was a time when both Mtas and its suppliers benefited. M&S'S ""Buy British"" policy not only protected local jobs; it also helped boost sales. With short lines of communication to suppliers, the retailer could keep a better check on quality and was more flexible. It could change ranges more quickly than rivals who imported, and was the first to bring innovative materials such as wrinkle-free fabric to the British public. 
Companies that became Me^S's preferred suppliers grew rapidly on the back of its success. Investors rated the big fourCoats Viyella, Courtaulds Textiles, Dewhirst and William Baird, which together supply 60% of nMs,s's clothing-more highly than the rest of the sector. 
Unfortunately, such dependence on one customer has left these companies vulnerable. Some 90% of Dewhirst's business is with M&s, while even William Baird, the least exposed, still sells more than 40% of its output to the retailer. Because the strong pound has made imports cheap, their domestic factories now carry hefty costs. For m&s, too, a British supply base has fewer advantages: quite apart from their higher costs, British suppliers have no particular advantage in servicing the retailer's growing number of overseas stores more efficiently. Faced with falling demand, M&s is suddenly asking its suppliers to shift production abroad. 
Although some are obediently doing so, M&S suppliers are still suffering. Worries that M&s may have too much stock have caused their shares to perform even worse than those of the rest of the British textile industry. In the past two months, M&S clothing suppliers have cut almost 2,300 British jobs. Even so, the industry in Britain may still have 30% too much capacity. 
Mergers could help to reduce capacity in the industry, but few have occurred. In September Courtaulds Textiles bought Claremont Garments for a paltry fom ($17m) plus debt-a mere 5% of Claremont's annual sales. William Baird is trying to persuade a reluctant Coats Viyella to sell its textiles and branded-clothes business for a probable om, including debt. 
Depressed share prices are one reason for inaction: there are few wealthy predators around. Though Baird's plans make sense (not least because Coats has mismanaged its crown jewel,Jaeger women's wear), Coats is unwilling to demerge clothes from its thread business. Though Baird is one of the better-run groups, its market capitalisation of E7m is too small for it to make a bid for the whole of Coats, worth 192m. David Suddens, Baird's chief executive, is frustrated: ""What's the point in being a quoted company? I can't use our paper. Even banks are saying `Christ no-not the retail sector, not the textile sector.' No one wants to know."" 
Anyway, being bigger may not be the answer. Ron McDerment, a textiles analyst at HSBC Securities, a stockbroking firm, argues that good old-fashioned management matters much more. ""[This business] needs managers who can be two things at oncedisciplined cost cutters who can run a tight supply chain and creatives who can get designs and fabrics right."" Sadly, the textiles business finds it hard to attract and retain talent. Like the clothes at M&S, British textiles have lost their appeal.  1999 Economic liberalism is surviving trial by recession, according to the latest worldwide opinion poll by Angus Reid and The Economist 
HISTORICALLY, recession is the midwife of protectionism. In good times, peoples and nations are happy to enjoy the benefits of open trade. Come bad times, they are tempted to minimise short-run pain through protection. 
The great question now is whether the liberal policies that have taken hold in many countries around the world in the 198os and 199os can survive an economic setback. During 1998, such a setback threatened to grow from being merely regional into one that, in 1999, could be more or less global. The Asian ""tigers"" had suddenly turned pussycats in 1997, and in 1998 their recessions proved deep. The Russian economy stubbornly refused to reform itself, and the country defaulted on its debts. Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund, went dramatically belly-up, prompting a private-sector rescue costing an estimated $4 billion. World stockmarkets turned sharply bearish in the early autumn. Forecasts for 1999 were for little or no growth, worldwide. 
Predictably, the voices ofthe protectionists were raised again. There were those who thought the blame lay in excessively free currency markets. George Soros, who had made his multi-billion-dollar fortune from such markets, published a book, ""The Crisis of Global Capitalism"" (Little, Brown L$17.99; Perseus Books $26, making this case. And there were those who wanted to guard domestic jobs against foreign competition or the pressures of foreign slumps. In both America and Asia, politicians began to raise the protectionist banner. 
Yet as far as public opinion is concerned, they have got nowhere. Amazing as it may seem, there has been no increase in popular support for protectionism worldwide over the last year (see chart on this page). An opinion poll carried out among more than 12,000 adults in 22 countries worldwide by the Angus Reid Group, a Canadian pollster, for The Economist shows that the proportion favouring protection did not change: at 48% last year to 47% this year, the fall is insignificant statistically. The conspicuous point is that the proportion of protectionists has failed to rise. 
The question asked was: ""Which of the following two broad approaches do you think would be the best way to improve the economic and employment situation in this country-protecting our local industries by restricting imports, or removing import restrictions to increase our international trade?"" This was designed to flush out true free traders. To count as one, a respondent had actually to favour lower barriers against imports and not merely to oppose the building of new barriers. It might therefore have been expected to understate the number of anti-protectionists. 
True, on this measure, protectionists do just outnumber free traders (47% to 42% worldwide) In particular, some Asian countries such as Malaysia remain strongly protectionist. Even in traditionally freetrading Asian countries, such as Taiwan, support for free trade has fallen. In 1997, free traders outnumbered protectionists in Taiwan by more than three to one. Now the ratio is two-to-one. 
But protectionism seems to be a lagging indicator rather than a leading one: in other words, bad times must come before it rises, rather than merely being expected to come. For support for free trade amongst the large, and still economically robust European Union economies-Britain, alas, excepted-has grown sharply. Even in Colbertist France, free traders are now only slightly outnumbered by protectionists. 
Nor has America begun to flinch. Not that the American dream of freedom has ever quite extended to international trade. A clear majority of Americans (56% to 37%) are protectionists even today. Yet over the past year, support for protectionism in America has hardly increased. 
The poll also sought to measure support for economic liberalism in a second way, by looking at countries' internal economic policies. Respondents here were asked: ""Which of the following would you prefer? More free and open competition between suppliers of goods and services, or more controls, subsidies and regulations from your government?"" 
Arguably, this question tends to encourage the liberal answer, just as the one on trade tends to encourage the protectionist answer. Even so, the support for competition-within living memory a dirty word to many-is impressive. 
Globally, economic liberals are in a two-to-one majority on this question. In North America, the majority is nearer to four-to-one. In Asia the liberals outnumber their opponents by more than two-to-one. They are now in a clear majority in Western Europe, and a majority, albeit not statistically significant, in Latin America. Globally the majority favouring competition over government control is down slightly compared with last year, by five percentage points. But it remains solid. 
Furthermore, the poll sought to explore a third dimension of economic liberalism: support for the free movement of capital. The question was: ""There's been some discussion recently about whether or not there should be tighter restrictions on the movement of money from country to country. Some say there should be tighter restrictions on this. Others say that is not necessary. What do you think?"" 
Risky capital 
Unlike the other two measures, we were not able to compare views on this with views last year. The question was only devised this year in response to emerging criticism of the workings of free capital markets. However, the results for 1998 are less encouraging for liberals than the results of our questions on trade. 
Worldwide, there is a clear preference for tighter controls. 49% favour them with 37% against. Some 14% don't know. 
Only in Spain and Italy of the 22 countries surveyed do a clear majority of people favour free capital movements. In Asia, liberal Hong Kong now produces only a fivepercentage-point margin against restrictions, and Japan only a two percentagepoint-margin. Public opinion in Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, and to a lesser extent in Taiwan and China is heavily against free capital movements. 
How might liberals react to these findings? There is a clear majority preferring competition to planning and regulations as a way of running an economy. Opinion on protectionism is divided but it remains stable; resisting it is no harder than it has ever been. Opinion is, however, hostile to free currency movements if not overwhelmingly so. So one way of assuaging public opinion would be to act to curb free currency and capital markets, preserving free markets in goods and services. 
Quite apart from its potential economic costs, however, this would be a risky strategy. Protectionist sentiment has a habit of starting with specific plausible cases and then extending to the general. Once the case is conceded in one area, capital movements, there is no guarantee that a new line could be held. 
A more promising avenue might be to tackle instead what public opinion worldwide seems to see as a major weakness of the international economic order: the weakness of its principal international institutions. The worldwide standing of those institutions is deplorably low. 
Take first the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Its policy of forcing budgetary discipline and market-based reform on member-countries has had the broad support of most pro-capitalist economists, though the developing world has been less enthusiastic. But that support is not mirrored in public opinion. Only one respondent in 20 worldwide says that they have ""a lot of confidence"" in the IMF. Only in India and the Philippines did more than one person in ten have a lot of confidence in the IMF. Internationally, four times as many respondents do not have much confidence at all in it, and those with little confidence outnumber those with confidence by nearly two to one. 
Nor does the IMF's sister organisation for development, the World Bank, fare any better. Again, four people think not much at all of its efforts for every one who has a lot of confidence in it. In only four countries of the 22 surveyed-India, Indonesia, Italy and the Philippines-do those favourable to the World Bank outnumber those unfavourable. Indeed, those questioned by our pollsters have more confidence in the United States to do something about world economic problems than they do for the work of either of the organisations specifically charged with dealing with such problems. For policymakers in 1999, that could prove powerful food for thought. 
The full poll results can be found on our website at www.economist.com  1999 IF THE most urgent question for Republicans in 1998 was why there was so little outrage about Bill Clinton's morals, the most urgent question for protectionists was why there was so little outrage about the surge in foreign takeovers of American companies. 
In the late 198os, when Japanese companies pocketed such American landmarks as the Rockefeller Centre and Columbia Pictures, the country went into a collective funk. A Newsweek cover declared that Japan was ""buying the soul of America""-and Michael Crichton wrote a best-seller, ""Rising Sun"", that was supposed to expose just how dreadful this prospect could be. In 1998, when foreign companies took over Random House, Chrysler, Bankers Trust and Amoco, there was scarcely a murmur of complaint. 
Why? Quite simply, because Americans are now convinced that theirs is the strongest economy in the world. In the 198os Americans hung their heads as the Japanese seized world-leadership in everything from cars to electronics. In the 199os they stood tall again as American companies dominated all the most exciting new industries, from computers to media to finance, and the American economy enjoyed its longest inflation-free expansion since 1945. 
Moreover, American firms are as likely to be the buyers as the bought. In 1989, American investment abroad was about half as much as foreign direct investment in the United States; in 1997, it was more than 25% bigger. Besides, a growing number of Americans-particularly in Silicon Valley and Hollywoodnow see foreign investors less as barbarians at the gates than as cash-rich country cousins who want nothing more than a chance to invest in American success. 
Still, for all their newfound self-confidence Americans remain surprisingly sceptical about free trade: far more sceptical than crisis-battered South Koreans or risk-averse Germans. Despite the booming economy, Bill Clinton has repeatedly failed to win renewal of his ""fast track"" authority to negotiate trade deals, blocking his desires to extend free trade to the whole of Latin America. 
Most of Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats in Congress don't share his enthusiasm for free trade, advocating all sorts of restrictions to do with labour and the environment; and a noisy group of Republican populists is intent on pushing their party in a more protectionist direction. An unholy alliance of these two factions succeeded in holding up the administration's request for $18 billion for the IMF for months, linking the grant to all sorts of time-wasting issues such as dolphin conservation. 
The fact that the IMF got its money in the end suggests that the initiative still lies with the internationalists. But the fact that, eight years into an economic boom, only 37% of Americans claim to support free trade also suggests that economic liberalism would have a harder time surviving trial by recession there than it has in much of the rest of the world.  1999 IF THE most urgent question for Republicans in 1998 was why there was so little outrage about Bill Clinton's morals, the most urgent question for protectionists was why there was so little outrage about the surge in foreign takeovers of American companies.

Americans are delighted with their own economy. Some 85% of Americans say it is performing well to only 14% who say it is performing poorly. By a majority of more than three to one, Americans say their own standard of living has improved. But they are not so confident about next year. More think that their economy will get worse than think it will get better. This is probably because a plurality of them are pretty pessimistic about the prospects for the world economy. 
By contrast, the Russians beat the Japanese by a short head for the title of the world's most despairing country. Of Russians, 98% think that the country is doing badly, compared with 91% of Japanese. By a four-to-one margin, the Russians expect things to get worse compared with a margin amongst the Japanese of just over three-to-one on the side of pessimism. 
Dissatisfaction with their government's performance is expressed by 87% of Russians; but an eccentric (nay, extraordinary) 9% think that it is doing well. Similarly, 86% of Japanese are dissatisfied with their government's performance, again with a loyalist 9% applauding their rulers' performance. 
Eighteen Russians think their living standard has got worse over the last year for every one who thinks it has improved. Eleven Japanese feel they are worse off for every one who feels better off. But the Japanese are much more pessimistic about the world economy than are the Russians. Barely more Russians expect the world economy to deteriorate than expect it to improve, but 39% of Japanese think it will deteriorate, while only 4% that it will improve. 
In Asia, gloom is not confined to Japan. South Korea is at the bottom of the pessimists' pack with 88% of her people thinking her economy is in poor shape. Indonesia and Thailand are not reckoned by their people to be doing much better, and Hong Kong is not far behind them. But in all four countries most people expect 1999 to be better economically than 1998. Can this be ascribed to an ""Asian value"" of optimism about the future? Well, in Japan the expectation is of a further deterioration. 
In Europe, outside Britain, the mood ahead of the launch of the single currency on January ist is quite buoyant. In France, Germany and Spain, pluralities think their economies are doing well. In Italy, however, slightly more people think it is doing poorly than think it is doing well. People in all four of these European countries think that their countries will do well in 1999 too. 
The United Kingdom is a bit of a European oddity. Britons are quite cheerful about the state of their economy and a higher proportion (58%) is satisfied with the performance of its government than is true in any other country surveyed outside Asia. But when it comes to prospects for next year, Britons are in pessimistic mood. Some 48% of them expect the world economy to deteriorate, with only 14% expecting it to improve. This is the most negative assessment in any country surveyed except Japan. 
While most of the European Union countries have become much keener on free trade and open markets, Britons have become more protectionist. Of those questioned in Britain, 53% now say they favour protection to 37% opposing it. This represents a net increase of IZ percentage points in protectionist sentiment between 1997 and 1998. 
Latin America is particularly gloomy. Amongst Mexicans, 85% think their economy is performing poorly, as do 75% of Brazilians. Only 29% of Latin Americans think their economy will improve next year, while 41% think it will get worse. The rest either don't know, or think it will stay the same. 
Comparing China and India, both think their economies are doing poorly, but the Indians are the more dissatisfied. Both think they will do better next year, with the Chinese much more optimistic Both also think the world economy will recover next year, again with the Chinese rather more optimistic  1999 Financial institutions are rushing to be ready for the euro's launch. The mood is confident, but there is no guarantee that things will follow the script 
THE dress rehearsals are over, the curtain is rising, and the leading players are scurrying to ensure that the performance begins on time-and wins plaudits. At lunchtime on December 31st, European finance ministers announced the rates at which ii national currencies would convert to Europe's single currency, the euro. By the time financial markets reopen on January 4th, banks must be ready to trade in euros. Between those dates lies a ""changeover weekend"", during which bankers, fund managers, securities dealers and regulators will be working around the clock, slurping not champagne but unseasonally sobering coffee. 
This frantic activity follows months of testing and retesting of banks' computer systems and their links to domestic stock exchanges and clearing houses. Some big banks have undergone five separate dry runs, and most claim they are ready. Still, there are plenty of butterflies. ""It's been like a play in which everyone has been rehearsing in separate dressing rooms,"" says Paul Cantwell of Andersen Consulting. ""When they all take the stage together, no one can be sure how the performance will go."" 
Still, there will be no shortage of action. Over the weekend, on top of doing their normal end-of-year accounts, financial firms must also plug the euro conversion rates into all of their software programs, reroute much of their foreign-exchange trading and redenominate bonds, shares, derivatives portfolios and bank accounts previously held in separate euro-zone currencies. Small wonder that, as well as booking up local hotel rooms, Goldman Sachs has taken the precaution of designating special ""rest areas"" for weary staff 
Although Britain is not adopting the euro, the City, as Europe's largest financial centre, has a feverish air of expectation. After three years of military-style planning, some 30,ooo financial folk will work over the new year weekend to guarantee a smooth transition. Fearful for London's financial-centre status, the City of London Corporation, a wealthy local authority run as a benevolent dictatorship, is doing its bit. It is paying to keep open the ""drain"", a short but key commuter line; making all of its 3,500 parking spaces free; and banning noisy construction work over the weekend. 
Regulators too will be missing lots of new year parties. The Bank of England is bringing in 300 staff to oversee internal changes and monitor the banking system. However, in a sign of public-sector austerity, hungry staff will have to pay for their own take-away food outside normal hours (contrast this with one French bank, which for some weeks has had a member of staff testing possible menus for the right balance of nourishment for the overwrought brain). All of Europe's national central banks will be in regular contact with the European Central Bank's changeover committee, which will be on hand to take emergency action. Members of the ECB'S governing council have been asked to stay within reach of a secure telephone. 
Judging by the mood in Frankfurt, they won't be needed. German bankers ooze confidence, scoffing at talk of last-minute panics. Deutsche Borse, which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, has spent six months fine-tuning its trading and settlement systems for the euro, and does not expect its 9o-strong conversion team to be particularly busy at the weekend. So confident is it that it has set up a special web site (www.eurostatus.exchange.de) so the curious can check on its progress hour by hour. 
Not that the Germans are leaving much to chance. At Commerzbank, where 400 employees will be at work or on stand-by, all calls into the bank will be routed directly to mobile telephones, so that everyone can be reached within seconds. Deutsche Bank has conducted 59 separate trial runs, linking its computers with clearing systems around Europe. During the conversion weekend, 2,ooo employees in 40 offices worldwide will be reporting to a ""global control centre"" in Eschborn, just outside Frankfurt. Deutsche claims it will be the only bank able to offer its full range of products in euros from January 4th. 
After a year in which it lost ground in the race to establish itself as a financial centre for Europe, Paris has no intention of missing any tricks over the conversion to the euro. Two years of preparation, and three rehearsals, culminating in a full dry run in November, have left the city's too-odd financial institutions quietly confident that the traditional French mastery of logistics will ensure a smooth meshing of gears over the long weekend. In all, lo,ooo people will play some part in the 9oo steps into which the exercise has been broken down. Banque Nationale de Paris has hung a 4,ooo-piece jigsaw puzzle in its euro control room, to remind the 6o0 people who will be toiling there that every little bit must fit into the bigger picture. 
Technical efficiency is one thing, but no preparations would be complete without making allowance for that other great French tradition-the strike. The French Bankers Association and the unions have duly negotiated special exemptions from the usual limits on working hours and requirements for Sunday rest. 
Attitudes in Italy seem altogether more laid back. Italian banks say they are ready for the euro, but have much smaller changeover teams on hand than their French and German counterparts. And compared with the Germans, the Italians do not seem to mind if everything does not go like clockwork. A senior official from the Bank of Italy, the central bank, says languidly, ""It will not be the end of the world if things go wrong on Monday. Systems will be working fine on Tuesday or Wednesday."" 
For all the confident talk, there are legitimate fears that the conversion process could still be derailed. Never before has so much depended on so many financial institutions doing so many things simultaneously. Michael Foot, the director in charge of euro planning at the Financial Services Authority, Britain's financial regulator, acknowledges three concerns for the weekend: that banks will run out of time; that data will be corrupted; and that some markets will not be able to reopen first thing Monday morning. Moreover, custodians might ""lose"" assets, and thus be unable to release them. 
Beyond the weekend lies much more work, including tests for settlement systems. Mistakes by one bank in paying another-for example by paying into the wrong account-could prevent the payee from settling its own debts, leading to financial gridlock. SHIFT, which runs a network through which many interbank payments are made, has assembled a 150strong team to help banks deal with payments problems. To avoid bottlenecks, it has warned banks against paying in very large batches. ""Like everyone else we are hoping for the best, but planning for the worst,"" says a spokesman. 
For all the gloomy scenarios, no one is much concerned about the big institutions. At least, not directly. All the big banks in Europe are convinced that they have done enough tinkering-or will have done by Monday-to greet the euro with confidence. Merrill Lynch, for example, has set aside around $8om for the total cost of conversion. More worrying are small and middie-sized banks, which are generally much less well prepared, and the knock-on effect their lack of foresight may have on others. As one apparently well-prepared banker from Salomon Smith Barney puts it: ""You can be driving carefully, but if someone comes around the corner and smashes into you, there isn't much you can do.""  1999 HOWEVER much of a challenge the birth of the euro may seem to bankers in Milan, Italy's financial centre, in the Sicilian capital of Palermo it is being seen as a disaster. The Sicilian regional government is gripped by a financial crisis. Its problem is simple: the regional government has run out of cash (it needs 1.7 trillion lire-$i billion-to balance this year's books) and can't persuade anyone to give it more. Franco Piro, Sicily's head of finance, complains that Sicily is owed 3 trillion lire by the central government. ""We are being punished by the criteria of the Maastricht treaty,"" he moans: the central government has been squeezing spending to fit the country's budget deficit into the 3% corset needed to qualify for euro membership. 
The regional government had previously been able to get loans from domestic and foreign banks to plug the hole; but on December 23rd, the 45 banks that it had approached refused to help. Although Mr Piro ascribes bankers' reluctance to the distractions of Christmas and preparations for the euro, there were weightier reasons for it. Some 30% of bank loans in Sicily are non-performing; the regional government itself has run up some 6 trillion lire in unpaid bills.

China, where few ordinary citizens have a credit card (indeed, where credit-cardstyle revolving consumer lending is illegal), is MasterCard's second-largest market after America. In 1997, the latest year for which figures are available, its turnover in China was an astounding $73 billion. 
How is the circle squared? As in some other countries, MasterCards in China are more debit than credit cards: cardholders must deposit money into their accounts. Purchases are deducted from these funds. MasterCard's success in China is thus more an indictment of the country's dreadful banks than a capitalist celebration of plastic. Almost all transactions are between businesses for big-ticket items such as tractors and trainloads of raw materials. Chinese companies often use credit cards-rather than cheques or wire transfers-to buy goods and services from each other. 
In the mid-198os, when MasterCard entered the market, the clearing system between banks in different cities was (and is) almost non-existent: a cheque could take up to a month to clear, and many sellers would not release goods until it did. The country did not have the nationwide telecommunications networks necessary for an electronic clearing system. Company executives were forced to carry suitcases of cash if they wanted to seal a deal on the spot. MasterCard uses people at the end of a telephone to approve a purchase rather than computerised links, thus making do with what is available. 
But the company's best days in China may be over. In 1999 the government plans a nationwide electronic clearing and settlement system to connect financial institutions. Still, MasterCard may not be too worried. These, after all, are Chinese banks: expect delays.  1999 SHARE prices in much of the world ended 1998 higher than they started it. Oddly, at the same time, the profitability of companies is shrinking, even in the world's leading economies. This begs the question of whether equity prices in rich countries now make any sense at all-but it also gives ominous warning of disappointing economic growth to come in 1999 
Share prices rose, on average, by more than 15% in 1998 in six of the rich world's biggest economies. But in the third quarter, the latest period for which there is data, company profits were 12% lower than a year earlier in those economies (see chart). Much of this is due to the continued sufferings of Japanese firms. But corporate profitability has fallen compared with the previous year in the other big economies as well. 
Continued economic strife in Asia is one cause of slimmer profit margins elsewhere. The devaluation of Asian currencies, and a huge amount of excess productive capacity, have intensified global price competition, especially in homogeneous, tradable goods such as textiles, chemicals and commodities. But in America and Britain, several years of decent economic growth have driven down unemployment to such an extent that labour costs are starting to rise-although the impact of this has been cushioned by higher productivity. 
These factors are unlikely to go away in 1999. And in continental Europe, the launch of the euro may increase price competition by making differences in pricing between countries in the euro-zone more transparent to consumers. 
In the case of corporate profits, the main uncertainty is how fast, if at all, the world's big economies will grow. The frenzied cutting of short-term interest rates by central bankers since the autumn's brief financial-market crisis seems to have averted the worst for now. But yields on corporate bonds, especially American ones, are typically higher now than six months ago, because investors are more worried about the riskiness of these securities. 
Worse, the recent decline in corporate profitability may itself point to slower growth ahead. In the past, changing profitability has been a useful lead indicator of economic trends. One reason is that, when firms earn lower profits, they generally become less optimistic about their future profitability, and vice versa-and so cut (or boost) their investment spending accordingly. Capital spending by companies is an important contributor to economic growth. If there is less of it, growth suffers. In continental Europe, most of the economic growth during the 199os was due to higher spending by companies. 
America's economy is now especially vulnerable to a sharp reduction in investment by firms. Much attention has been lavished on American consumers' alarming recent habit of spending more than they earn. But American companies also have a ""negative savings ratio"", points out David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan, because they have been borrowing so much to invest. British and continental European companies, in contrast, have not paid for capital spending in the 199os by getting deeper into debt. 
Running up debts to finance investment may make sense in conditions of rapid economic growth. But, when growth slows and profitability tumbles, heavy indebtedness will force companies to make ferocious cuts in capital spending. Mr Mackie thinks this could be severe enough to push the American economy into deep recession. A similar thing happened in Japan, that other ""miracle economy"", in the early i99os. Companies had been borrowing and investing as though the economy would grow for ever. Its economy is still paying the price. Japan's problems have mired Asia in recession; if America's economy went down the plughole, the rest of the world would probably follow suit.  1999 Profits of doom

CAR makers have long used sex to peddle their wares. Recently, however, a new twist to this old idea has developed. Or, rather, two twists-the double helix of DNA. For both BMW and Renault have based their latest European marketing campaigns around this icon of modem biology. Their advertising agents, it seems, have decided that genetics is metaphorically, as well as literally, sexy. 
Advertising agents, of course, are paid to be sensitive to subtle shifts in the Zeitgeist, so the two campaigns might be seen as an indication of how the public actually perceives genetics and the related subject of evolutionary theory. Not surprisingly, a few outdated myths are perpetuated. Both advertisements, for instance, play on the popular conception of evolution not just as change, but as progress-something which many biologists would dispute. But the gist of the advertising shows just how much the central concerns of modern biology have indeed entered the popular consciousness. (There is also a surprising popular appetite for mathematics-see box on next page.) 
BMW'S campaign, which launches its new 3-series sports saloon in Britain and Ireland, shows the new creation and four of its earlier incarnations zigzagging around a landscape made up of giant DNA sequences, with a brief explanation that DNA is the molecule responsible for the inheritance of such features as strength, power and intelligence. The Renault offering, which promotes its existing Laguna model, employs evolutionary theory even more explicitly. The company's television commercials intersperse clips of the car with scenes from a lecture by Steve Jones, a professor of genetics at University College London. Besides Dr Jones, who is one of Britain's most media-friendly scientists, the lecture features pictures of fossils of extinct animals called trilobites, and also the cliched ascent of man from ape to human. 
According to Jeremy Hemmings, who heads BMW's campaign at wcRs, a London advertising firm, the advertisement is intended to convey the idea of development allied to heritage. The latest product, in other words, should be viewed as the new and improved scion of a long line of good cars-with the implication that what is true of the car is also true of the driver. 
The advertisement is stark and highly stylised. To the untutored eye, the DNA sequences look like enormous black-runged ladders (they are actually enlargements of the electrophoretic gels used to tease out the individual genetic ""letters"" of which DNA is composed). But the eyes of BMW drivers are not, of course, untutored. The car is a status symbol in a society where success depends on knowledge, and the ad panders to the presumption that its viewers will have the knowledge to understand it. According to Mr Hemmings, they do. It has had one of BMW'S highest awareness ratings-a measure of how well people remember the product, and the message conveyed. 
Renault's message, according to Jonathan Wignall, the head of the Laguna campaign at the company's British subsidiary, is more subtle. It is that evolution works by gradual improvements rather than sudden leaps (in this, Renault is aligning itself with biological orthodoxy). So, although the new car in the advertisement may look like the old one, the external form conceals a number of significant changes to the engine. While these alterations are almost invisible to the average driver, Renault hopes they will improve the car's performance, and ultimately its survival in the marketplace. 
Whether they actually do so will depend, in part, on whether marketeers have read the public mood correctly. For, even if genetics really does offer a useful metaphor for automobiles, employing it in advertising is not without its dangers. 
That is because DNA'S public image is ambiguous. In one context, people may see it as the cornerstone of modern medical progress. In another, it will bring to mind such controversial issues as abortion, genetically modified foodstuffs, and the sinister subject of eugenics. 
In some countries, such as Germany (where the BMW campaign has not run, even though the company is German), people are particularly sensitive to these issues. And when genetics is not merely a metaphor, but the actual product, things can go horribly wrong-as Monsanto, an American biotechnology company, found when it spent L1m ($1.68m) attempting to persuade the British ofthe merits of genetically engineered foodstuffs. The actual effect of the campaign, unluckily for Monsanto, was to alert sceptical consumers to the fact that something they may have thought would be happening in the indeterminate future was about to hit their supermarket shelves. Few liked the idea. 
Car makers are probably standing on safer ground than biotechnology firms. But even they can make mistakes. Though it would not be obvious to the casual observer, some of the DNA which features in BMW'S ads for its nice, new car once belonged to a woolly mammoth-a beast that has been extinct for 10,000 years. Not, presumably, quite the message that the marketing department was trying to convey.  1999 IF AN old rule of thumb from the publishing industry is to believed, every equation included in a book halves the number sold. Yet in recent months several mathematical treatises have become bestsellers. Slim volumes have told the stories of the numbers e, n (which has also had a film named after it) and i (the square root of-1), while other books have explored the nature of infinity, the workings of calculus and, most successfully of all, how Fermat's last theorem was eventually proved after centuries of effort. Given how much schoolchildren hate maths, this is all rather surprising. 
The secret, it turns out, is to stick to the old rule and leave out the dreaded equations-and, indeed, any other scary-looking squiggles likely to remind readers of their school days. Instead, mathematical blockbusters take the form of biographies (often, admittedly, of numbers, not people), histories (of the calendar, for exampie), quests (to prove or disprove things), or coming-of-age tales such as ""Good Will Hunting"", a film in which a young prodigy redeems himself through mathematics. In other words, standard story-telling devices are used to sugar the mathematical pill. 
The resulting books and films are appealing for two reasons, according to Peter Tallack of Weidenfeld & Nicolson, a British publisher. First, they are aspirational: they offer readers the illusion of grappling with mathematical concepts, without having to do the hard work of actually understanding them. A classic example is Simon Singh's book on Fermat's last theorem, which wafts such abstruse ideas as modular forms, elliptic curves, and Galois theory under the reader's nose. 
The second reason is that these mathematical blockbusters provide an attractive and convenient excuse for people who hated maths at school. ""Look,"" they can say, ""I liked this book, so I must simply have had useless teachers."" (Do not ask someone who offers this excuse after reading Dr Singh's book to prove Fermat's last theorem over dinner.) 
Publishers may not understand much maths either, but they know how to add up the profits from a winning formula. More maths books are heading for the printing presses. Three tomes about zero alone are currently in production. Just wait for the numbers from sales of the film rights. 
pattern of the liquid crystals is designed to produce the same effect on the passing light that a real P2000 would have. The two subbeams are then recombined in the normal way and the result shone on to a 2mm-wide square on a piece of photosensitive plastic to create a hogel. 
In practice, three lasers-one for each of the primary colours red, green and blueare shone through the screen simultaneously to produce a full-colour hogel. The process is then repeated for a neighbouring hogel using a neighbouring ray trace. 
Making the master image is a time-consuming process. The ray trace for each hogel must be computed separately; even using the latest Silicon Graphics supercomputers, that takes over a second. The whole image, therefore, requires about 3oo hours to generate. (It contains around three terabytes of data, which is more than a copy of the film ""Titanic"".) Making subsequent copies should, however, be a lot faster. Zebra reckons that, once the number-crunching has been done, it will be possible to turn them out at the rate of 12 an hour. 
The Detroit display is, of course, a publicity stunt. It is unlikely that customers will be content to inspect a mere hologram before they buy. But the Zebra system has several serious purposes. When perfected, it will speed up the design process by giving engineers a real sense of what their brainchildren look like, without the need for the clay models they currently employ. And, when a design is completed, the senior executives who make the decision about whether to put it into production will have a much better idea of what it is that they are approving or rejecting. 
If mass produced, Zebra's system could also add a new dimension to poster advertising-and not just in the car industry. The company is planning to market the invention to a wide range of advertising and entertainment firms. So, although the holodeck of the starship Enterprise may still be some way off, the ads for Star Trek movies may soon have their own dimensions of virtual reality.  1999 JOURNALISTS attending the Detroit Motor Show-the American automobile industry's top annual shindig-are used to seeing concept cars. These are vehicles that incorporate the sort of technological wizardry which manufacturers hope to put into their production models a year or two hence. This year, however, Ford will go one better. The star of its stand is the P2000, a car that is not so much conceptual as non-existent. And yet visitors to the stand will be able to walk around it, look inside and underneath it, and do almost everything to it that motoring journalists normally do except kick its tyres and drive off in it. For the P2000 is a hologram. 
Holography, of course, is nothing new. But the technology that has produced the P2ooo is a significant step forward for several reasons. First, it allows holograms to be big (currently, the largest are about a metre, or three feet, across; the P2000 image is printed on ten 6ocm-square panels, making it three metres by two). Second, it abolishes the weird distortions of parallax which normal holograms suffer when examined from the wrong direction. Third, it produces accurate colours. And fourth, you don't actually have to have a real object to photograph. 
This holographic paragon was invented by Michael Klug and his colleagues at Zebra Imaging, in Austin, Texas, when they were students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory. It works by building on a surprising holographic principle-that each bit of the film carrying a hologram actually contains a whole image. (In other words, if you cut a piece of holographic film in two, and look at one half, you will still see a complete picture, albeit with a more restricted view.) 
Zebra's process makes this explicit. Its holograms are, like a television image, composed of numerous elements (called ""hogels"", in imitation of a television screen's ""pixels""), each of which is a complete hologram in its own right, but is taken from a slightly different angle to its neighbours. 
""Taken"" is, perhaps, not quite the right word. Since the P2000 doesn't exist, there is no object to take even a single image of, let alone the 9oo,ooo images that go to make up the Zebra hologram. This deficiency is made up for by the computers in Ford's design department, on which the P200 has been conceived. These machines are able to ""view"" the new car from any angle they like, under any lighting conditions that are programmed into them, and it is these individual views, known as ray traces, that are used to generate the hogels. 
A hologram of a real object is made by splitting a laser beam in two, reflecting one of the two resulting sub-beams off the object of interest, recombining the sub-beams, and exposing a photographic plate or film to the result. The interference between the subbeam that has been reflected off the object and the unaffected (or ""reference"") sub-beam produces a pattern on the plate which, when developed and illuminated, reveals a three-dimensional picture of the original object. 
In the case of the P2,ooo, the object sub-beam is directed through a liquid-crystal screen rather than on to a real object. The screen is under computer control, and the pattern of the liquid crystals is designed to produce the same effect on the passing light that a real P2000 would have. The two subbeams are then recombined in the normal way and the result shone on to a 2mm-wide square on a piece of photosensitive plastic to create a hogel.

So, although the holodeck of the starship Enterprise may still be some way off, the ads for Star Trek movies may soon have their own dimensions of virtual reality.  1999 IN THE next few days the shutters will be coming off the world's biggest scientific mirror. It is 8.3 metres (326 inches) across, and although it sits on a mountain top on the island of Hawaii rather than in Japan itself, it is the pride and joy of Japanese astronomy. It is the heart of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan's latest toy, the Subaru telescope-a device named after the star cluster known to westerners as the Pleiades. 
National pride was, indeed, an important motive for building the new telescope. That its mirror is 10cm wider than any other telescope's gives Japan's bureaucrats a warm glow that probably makes up for their having to change the law to grant diplomatic privileges to the civil-service astronomers travelling to Hawaii to operate it That it is 6.42 metres wider than the mirror of the country's largest existing instrument-a tiddler located near Okayama, in western Honshugives an even warmer glow to the astronomers themselves. Now they will be able to make some serious observations in the visible and infra-red frequencies, and thus hold up their heads at conferences. 
Such size, however, can bring problems of its own. Big mirrors are expensive, so the modern trend is towards computer-controlled arrays of smaller, cheaper mirrors that can be co-ordinated to mimic the behaviour of a single large one. Big mirrors also tend to sag under their own weight, distorting as they move around to look at different parts of the sky. 
In Subaru's case the sagging is dealt with by making the mirror thin-a mere 20cm from back to front. Though that also makes it more flexible (and makes the ability to grind and polish the glass to create a light-capturing parabolic surface without actually breaking the thing all the more impressive), this flexibility can be exploited to keep the reflective surface in shape. 
That is done by 261 ""actuator"" arms, which push on the mirror from behind to preserve the curvature so precisely that it can distinguish two objects 1/18,000th of a degree apart-the equivalent of being able to spot a tennis ball on the neighbouring island of Maui, 100km away. 
This, combined with a new digital camera developed for it by Mitsubishi Electric, will make it the most powerful groundbased optical telescope around. And when its aluminium coating is replaced with silver in a year or two's time (a huge vacuumchamber housed at the telescope's base will be used to deposit metallic vapour on to the mirror's reflecting surface), it will be able to see into the infra-red with equal clarity, opening up a much neglected area of astronomy. Indeed, at some wavelengths it should out-perform the Hubble space telescope, which does not even have the handicap of looking through the atmosphere. 
But what will it search for? One bothersome thing astronomers have discovered, as they have peered ever deeper into space, has been unexpected regions of sheer emptiness. Like huge bubbles, these so-called ""great voids"", which are hundreds of millions of light-years across, seem to be surrounded by thin films. In this case the films are composed of billions of individual galaxies. The universe, in other words, appears to be made of foam. 
The most likely explanation for this is that gravitational forces from invisible socalled ""dark matter""-perhaps lOO times more abundant than the observable matter in the universe-are tugging that observable matter into odd shapes. By measuring some of these large bubbles, Norio Kaifu, the head of the project in Hawaii, hopes that Subaru will provide astronomers with a clearer idea of what, if it actually exists, the dark matter really is. 
Further out into space, beyond lo billion light-years, Subaru will be able to see the universe in its infancy-not long after the primordial fireball cooled enough to become transparent. While still unable to observe the actual beginning of the universe (signs of which are reckoned to be 15 billion light-years away), the telescope will be able to detect some of the earliest objects to condense from the primordial gas. 
These objects are predicted to be galaxies in their initial star-forming phase, with giant black holes at their centres. Dr Kaifu hopes to find them by using naturally occurring ""gravitational lenses"" to boost Subaru's magnification still further. 
A gravitational lens is a galaxy that lies exactly between a more distant object and the earth. Its gravitational field thus bends and focuses the light from the distant object, making it appear closer than it really is. Such lenses have already been used successfully by the Hubble telescope but, with its longer reach, Subaru ought to be able to employ them to look still further afield. Size, it appears, does matter after all.  1999 The war against drugs is either not working or succeeding at too high a cost, several recent books agree. What should replace it is harder to be certain of

THE Fix By Michael Massing. Simon and Schuster; 335 pages; $25 
WAR is a dirty business, and the war Won drugs involves plenty of filth: deceit, corruption and damage to civil liberties, not to mention outright violence-and that's just from the good guys. Every struggle has to have heroes, and America's antidrugs campaign makes its casting billboard-clear. The white hats are enforcement agents stamping out narcotics at home and abroad, police sweeping dealers and users off the streets,judges jailing drug offenders, not to mention plucky little civilians who ""just say no"". The black hats are shadowy figures: greedy drug barons, mostly foreign, who exploit their own countrymen and corrupt America's children. Congress and Hollywood, spurred on by alarmed parents, have created such a drugs mythology that the good and evil of narcotics is now as distinct, to many, as Mother Teresa and Saddam Hussein. 
Yet today's highly militarised drugs campaign originated in more than medicine and morality. From the start the war has involved political interest and financial gain, as well as frequent misunderstanding-not to mention downright misrepresentation-of the best evidence about drugs' medical and social effects. 
If these were novel or incidental mistakes, the war might be more understandable. But, along with social concern and good sense, modern drug policy has from the start involved fear and unreason, often directed against foreigners or outsiders. It is almost 125 years since authorities in San Francisco launched an early salvo in the western war on drugs by clamping down on opium use among the growing population of Chinese labourers. In the years leading up to the Harrison Act of 1914, which amounted to the first federal ban on nonmedical narcotics, its drafters played on fears of drug-crazed, sex-mad negroes to win support in the South. 
Then 20 years later, the spectre of the sky-high, violent Mexican immigrant was played up to sell the public on the criminalising of marijuana. At several times since the 1930s, governments have used the drug card, whether to lean on dispensible foreign dictators or to brush back homegrown countercultures. 
One thing that has changed, though, are the high stakes that America is willing to play. In 198o, the federal government spent around $1 billion on drug control; federal, state and local spending last year exceeded $30 billion, which includes much expanded programmes of crop eradication, border patrolling and sting operations. Only a third of the federal government's drug-control spending goes on drugs education or drugs treatment. 
How much success this money buys depends on your definition. According to United Nations estimates, Americans are spending almost $60 billion on illegal drugs a year, mainly on the ""soft"" drug, marijuana, and its ""hard"" counterparts, cocaine and heroin. These are, unavoidably, guesstimates. But nobody seriously contests that drugs continue to pour into America and that prices have fallen. Cocaine costs half or less what it did in the early 198os and heroin sells for just under $1,ooo a gram, three-fifths of its price a decade ago. Purity has also increased. In the 198os, street heroin was so adulterated that injecting straight into the blood was the surest way to achieve a high. Now fixes are commonly more than 5o% pure, which means that users who might be deterred by needles can smoke or snort the drug instead. 
A third of all Americans admit to having tried drugs and at least 13m are occasional users. Drug arrests were i.im in 1995, double the 198o figure. There are 400,ooo Americans behind bars for drug offences, eight times the number 19 years ago. 
Those who fight the war on drugs, with its strict penalties at home and sharp punishment abroad, point to seizures of both drugs and their users as victories. In their terms, they are. And if slowing the spread of hard drugs is a sensible goal, which it seems to be, there is indeed good news. Nationwide studies of drug use, such as the University of Michigan survey of high-school students, suggest that although teenage marijuana use has risen in recent years, experimentation with cocaine or heroin among young, first-time users has stayed fairly steady. Those who question or oppose the drugs war, however, reckon that this is the wrong body count. Although casual hard-drug consumption may be dropping, the number of hard-core hard drug users-those most directly associated with the private and collective misery of drugshas scarcely budged since the war began. 
Instead the war's critics propose an entirely new approach that drops or downplays military means and abandons unconditional surrender as the goal. The antiwar doves, as will be seen, form a growing and disputatious camp. Yet whether they favour disapproval or toleration, continued prohibition or legalisation, most doves accept that core drug abuse is not going to be eradicated at an acceptable price, that crusading moralism is counterproductive and that drugs policy should be refocused on education for the young and ""harm reduction"" for habitual users-for example, methadone programmes, needle-exchange centres or prescription heroin. 
It sounds like common sense. But good sense alone will not end the war on drugs. Both the law makers and law breakers have too much invested in the conflict for either to lay down arms easily. Even amid falling prices, drug producers continue to profit from the risk premium that prohibition puts on their multi-billion dollar industry. The anti-drug warriors' jobs and budgets depend on expensive enforcement and lucrative asset seizures. Having demonised their foes, they can only with great difficulty now make peace with the devil. 
Back to the future 
Neither side is above massaging the drugs statistics. But anyone who suspects that the critics of the drugs war are toying with the facts should read ""Drug Crazy"". This book describes the origins and consequences of America's present narcotics policy. It moves from gangland drug busts to Colombian coca plantations to Mexican border patrols. This is reportage from the front line, told with all the verve of an action film, a style which no doubt owes much to the fact that its author, Mike Gray, is a Hollywood screenwriter and producer. 
Mr Gray does not shrink from describing the violence of the drugs war, from shoot-outs in the ghettoes of Chicago to explosions on the streets of Bogota. But the legal burden of America's current drug policy comes through most clearly in his description of how drug dealers are brought to justice. Chicago's county court, which has seen its caseload quadruple in the last 20 years largely because of continued tightening of policy on drugs, now runs round the clock. 
Although most people who take crack cocaine are white, 96% of the crack defendants in federal courts are black or Hispanic. This is largely because white people, being richer, do their deals behind closed doors, while blacks and Hispanics tend to trade on the streets, where they are more easily watched and arrested. 
The night shift at Cook County court catches only the foot soldiers of such drug armies as Chicago's Gangster Disciples. The officers stay out of sight and, generally, out of jail. Justice is summary, and baffling: ten-minute trials lead to five-year sentences for possession of a fifth of an ounce of crack, while the same amount of powdered cocaine lands its owner a few weeks in prison. Crack is cocaine mixed with baking soda to make it smokable and stronger. But concentrating the drug also concentrates the penalty, introduced during the crack scare of the 198os. As blacks use more crack than powdered cocaine, the punishment falls disproportionately on them. Arrest and imprisonment are scarcely deterrents. A young lawyer at the county court is quoted as saying, ""We're not producing justice here. We're manufacturing revolutionaries."" 
On a continent once famous for revolutionaries-Latin America-the tough position of the United States has had mixed effects. The Bush administration spent $2 billion on crop eradication and substitution, spraying the jungle and bribing peasants to plant passion fruit rather than coca plants-with little success. By 1992, cocaine production had grown by 15% and the business had spread across an area the size of the continental United States. It had also become frighteningly efficient, first dominated by Pablo Escobar (a ""ruthless killer"", as Mr Gray describes him, with ""a pleasant side"") in Medellin and then the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Cali. The high-tech barriers America erected along its borders have succeeded in diverting entry of South American cocaine from Florida to California and Texas via Mexico, thereby drawing another country into the violence and corruption which has plagued Colombia. And the high premium that the criminalisation of drugs places on them means that South America has turned its eye to heroin, a far more profitable drug than cocaine. 
None of this, as Mr Gray stresses, should come as a surprise. America's last concerted effort at substance control, prohibition of alcohol in the 192os, had similar effects. It inflated prices, drove bootleg suppliers to organise, encouraged the spread of guns and crime, corrupted a quarter of the federal enforcement agents-and doubled the consumption of hard liquor, all within a decade. Nor does ""Drug Crazy"" neglect the influence of stubborn or strong-minded individuals. It is full of outsize characters from the past: Hamilton Wright, for example, an American doctor turned diplomat, who tried to bully the world into drug prohibition, crafted the Harrison Narcotics Act and was later sacked for drinking on the job. Or Harry Anslinger, head of drug enforcement from 1930 to to i962, who perfected the sledge hammer school of narcotics control and invoked every menace from axemen to communism. 
Drugs in history 
Because the drugs war is so noisy and so visible, it is often easy to forget that drugs are not just an American issue. Martin Booth's ""Opium: A History"" charts the rise of heroin from its ancient origins in the poppies of Eastern Europe to modern-day trade on the streets of America. The book's wealth of detail is remarkable: all aspects botanical, political, economic, cultural and pharmacological are discussed (including the unexpected etymology of such slang as ""hip"", ""hype"" and ""junkie""). Unlike ""Drug Crazy"" which is mainly focused on the Americas, much of ""Opium"" is set in Europe and Asia, giving the book a more international perspective and more comprehensive feel. 
Although Mr Booth's accounts of famous addicts, from Clive of India to John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola, make for interesting reading, the real fascination of ""Opium"" is in its account of the common man's habit through history. Until the Harrison Act, morphine and opium-mainly in the tincture laudanum or as patent medicine-were freely available in America, as they were in Europe. Opium was a sovereign cure in Victorian England for afflictions ranging from diarrhoea to depression. Babies were fed the drug in soothing syrups such as Godfrey's Cordial, leading to claims of physical and mental retardation, exactly the same concerns voiced about today's ""crack babies"". 
In 1868, British public health authorities took most opiates out of the hands of grocers and put them into those of dispensing doctors and pharmacists (as, in America, did the Harrison Act). Starting with the International Opium Commission of 1909, American efforts to curtail world manufacture, sale and distribution of opium and its derivatives met with lively resistance from Europe, India and other countries with a stake in the international trade. Yet from the 1920s to the 198os, a series of international treaties forced countries to clamp down on the production, trade and consumption of opiates, whether for ritual, for fun or as self-administered medicine. In that time, the penalties for peddling and possession tended to climb, especially in America. 
One clear historical lesson that emerges from ""Opium"" is that people will take drugs whether or not they are proscribed, and they will do so for all sorts of reasonsto escape life's burdens, for adventure, for straightforward fun. In 19th-century Britain, Mr Booth tells us, the Fens of East Anglia were awash in opium. Agricultural labourers took their pennyworth of ""elevation"" along with a nightly beer as a lift out of working drudgery. This is not so far from the plight of crack addicts in America's inner cities, boxed in by poverty, deadend jobs and broken families. 
What does vary widely with history, however, are official attitudes towards the drug trade. As Britain followed America's line in the 198os and got ""tough on drugs"", complaints were regularly fired against heroin-producing nations, such as Pakistan. Supply-side control was seen as the solution to the drug problem; if only these people would pull up their poppies, then Western drug use would plummet. Ironically, exactly the same argument was used against the British in the early 19th century, when they foisted opium from India on the Chinese in exchange for tea. When China's then drug czar, Lin Ts-hsu, complained to the British that they were breaking imperial edicts banning opium import and possession, the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, replied that the opium trade was a Chinese problem and that it should be dealt with by controlling consumption. His logic sounds familiar today. 
Such shifts are common in drug debates, according to Richard Rudgley, a University of Oxford anthropologist. Which intoxicants are forbidden and which tolerated has never added up to a very coherent story. How many exasperated parents have lectured teenagers about drugs while pouring themselves a third drink or lighting another fag? Some of the most debilitating and addictive compounds, such as alcohol and tobacco, are permitted while less obviously damaging drugs such as marijuana are widely proscribed. 
In ""The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances"", Mr Rudgley offers a quick history of almost lOO drugs, sacred and profane, from the hallucinogenic mushroom amanita to the zombie mixtures of Haitian folklore. Though dutiful on ordinary drugs, he is gripped when it comes to the exotic or obscure. There are intriguing entries on socalled psychoactive animals. Apparently members of the Humr tribe in south-west Sudan dream vividly of giraffes after taking giraffe liver extract or bone marrow. What heroin taker would swap its orgasmic rush for a giraffe dream? As Mr Rudgley sweeps from soma of the ancient Indo-Iranians to Ecstasy in the British rave scene, he is careful always to put his psychoactive substances into a wider cultural or even ritual context, an aspect that has been largely lost in Western drug use. 
A quick fix 
Common to many of these books is the charge that American administrations have tended to neglect solid evidence which might ease their drug bind. This is most obvious with marijuana, which 7om Americans over the age of 12 have tried, some for medical reasons, but most for fun. Since the 193os, blue-ribbon panels of scientists and doctors have urged its decriminalisation, only to meet rebuttal from influential voices, like Anslinger, that marijuana was a ""gateway"" substance leading users to more damaging drugs such as heroin. Yet the evidence to support marijuana's ""gateway"" status is remarkably thin. Marijuana is not benign. There are legitimate concerns about its effect on memory and on the lungs, among other organs. But by most clinical (and personal) accounts, the drug is no more dangerous than alcohol, a freely-flowing intoxicant. 
Yet marijuana policy in America does appear to be softening. Half a dozen states have voted to legalise the drug for medical purposes. By contrast, the tough official policy on hard drugs shows little sign of change. Nor do the anti-drug-war doves air pear to be making much headway in winning converts where it counts-among elected politicians and in the criminal-justice system. Part of the trouble is that the anti-war camp is divided, not least on something seemingly as basic as the medical effects of hard drugs. This is not their fault: the issues are complex and the evidence is often disputable. Yet given the sheer weight of belief that hard drugs are very dangerous indeed, the burden of disproof rests, politically, on the doves. 
To take a glaring example of where wellinformed, fair-minded people can differ on what you might expect was observable fact: Mr Rudgley describes the bleak prospects of America's 375,ooo crack babies, born to addicted mothers, who face a life of mental and physical retardation. But Mr Gray claims that this figure is grossly exaggerated and that most crack babies grow up to be quite normal and not ""brain-damaged, unteachable monsters"". 
Any sensible approach to hard drugs ought to start with an understanding of addiction. But addiction, too, appears to be a bendable notion. Do drugs give addicts a habit or do addicts make a habit of drugs? Not everyone who takes a hard drug spirals into dependence. How destructive it is to be hooked depends a lot on your circumstances. Cocaine is most certainly addictive for some, but many users manage to limit their intake to the occasional snort. Heroin is much harder to take or leave. But addicts can regularise consumption and do jobs, as heroin-prescription programmes in Switzerland and Britain have shown. 
The best research seems to confirm most people's intuition that addiction depends on a damaging mix of biochemistry and bad social conditions. Much of this research is discussed in ""Buzzed"", a guide to the effects of legal and illicit drugs from coffee to cocaine. The authors wrote it out of concern for what they take to be a growing ""disconnect"" between advances in understanding of the physiology of addiction and public perceptions of drug abuse. ""Buzzed"" describes complex neurochemistry with admirable clarity and its glossary of drug terms will raise smiles. Roche may be a respectable Swiss pharmaceutical company. But ""Roche"" in street slang is Rohypnol, the notorious date-rape drug. ""Prudential"" has nothing to do with insurance but means a crack-user. ""Buzzed"" is less clear about how much cocaine or heroin you can take without risking addiction. This is not its fault. Even the best evidence on this has an elusive, it-depends quality: instant, one-off addiction is rare even with heroin, it seems, but repeated use over a few weeks or less can create dependence. Yes, but what is the connection between that first use and those few repeats? 
Denouncing the war on drugs is the easy part. Finding a different approach is trickier. The more radical anti-war doves believe in sweeping legalisation. Dirk Chase Eldredge is one such and he makes a fact-packed case in ""Ending the War on Drugs"". Unlike ""Drug Crazy"", which views the war from the trenches, this book reads more like a conference report from a chateau general. 
Yet the author is not what you might expect. Mr Eldredge is a life-long Republican and former campaign manager for President Reagan, whose wife, Nancy, sponsored ""Just Say No"". Within the party his is very much a minority view: most Republicans in Congress who speak out on the issue are unblinkingly pro-war and would like to see users and pushers off the streets for good. 
Undaunted, Mr Eldredge spells out how legalisation could be accomplished. His preferred system would include staterun sales, quality-and-price control and a ban on advertising. Revenue from drug sales and a ""peace dividend"" (fewer prisoners and crop eradications to pay for)would, he believes, provide money for anti-drug education, drug treatment and research. 
As a virgin-lands policy, this has strong appeal. Unfortunately, America is not virgin soil and Mr Eldredge's proposal is beset by several layers of difficulty. He himselfacknowledges the problem faced by the constitutional primacyof the states in criminal matters: repealing federal drug laws would do little good if states did not follow in concert. He imagines the black market that would persist if for example one state legalised while its neighbour continued to proscribe. 
A similar difficulty exists at the international level. America has signed several drug treaties that prohibit trade in narcotics and oblige countries to police its use. Either America must persuade much of the world to decriminalise, having spent decades cajoling or coercing other nations into adopting an opposite line. Or America must abrogate treaties and legalise unilaterally, a step which could turn it into a black-market drugs exporter. Politically, neither course looks appetising. 
A third problem is uncertainty about the use- and addiction-effects if cocaine and heroin were decriminalised. It may well be that some people will take drugs whatever the law says. Just as Mr Booth cites history, Mr Eldredge cites recent opinion polls in support of the view that drug laws have little visible effect on drug conduct. There are strict drug laws and most people do not take drugs. But to treat the second as a consequence of the first, he believes, is a mistake. The reasons people give for why they do not take drugs include all sorts of things-health effects, moral scruples, personal dislikes-but the law seldom figures highly among them. 
This is persuasive as far as it goes. But it skirts the main issue: how many people would try hard drugs if they were legally available, and how many new addicts would there be? Prohibitionists point to the Dutch experience. The partial decriminalisation of cannabis there was followed, they point out, by a sharp rise in use by teenagers. Increased availability, in other words, inevitably means some increased consumption. But the marijuana parallel is not relevant, many doves insist, since soft and hard drugs are so different. Cocaine and heroin, they seem to be saying, are their own best deterrent. 
The truth is nobody can say with any confidence what would happen if hard drugs were legalised. No country has yet dared to try and addiction research has not yet given firm enough answers. 
A middle way 
Not surprisingly, many people are looking for a middle way between the diehard warriors and the out-and-out legalisers. Last year, Foreign Affairs published an instructive exchange between Ethan Nadelmann, who favours harm-reduction for illegal hard drugs in a context of marijuana decriminalisation (""Commonsense Drug Policy"";January-February 1998 issue) and Herbert Kleber and Mitchell Rosenthal, who favour continued proscription but think money should also be invested in education, treatment and research on the home front (""Drug Myths from Abroad""; September-October 1998). 
In ""The Fix"", Michael Massing describes in detail one of America's few sustained attempts to relieve or cure addicts rather than punish them. Early in the 197os an estimated 600,ooo Americans regularly used heroin, a number swollen by addicted soldiers returning from Vietnam. President Nixon asked Jerome Jaffe, a psychiatrist from Chicago, to set up methadone centres and abstinence programmes across the country. At their height, such ""demandside"" initiatives received two-thirds of the federal drug budget, and made considerable gains: crime rates fell and fewer addicts died of overdoses. 
But as the heroin crisis abated, so did government interest in the Jaffe programmes. Subsequent administrations, Republican and Democratic, turned to ""sup ply-side"" controls abroad and to locking up users and pushers in America. Mr Massing is particularly critical of a shift in resources under Presidents Reagan and Bush from the dark heart of drug use-hard-core cocaine and heroin addiction-to teenage marijuana use. 
A few methadone treatment centres carry on Dr Jaffe's tradition, but they have room for only 15% of America's 800,ooo heroin addicts. ""The Fix"" takes to the street with one service, New York's Hot Line Cares, as it lives hand-to-mouth trying to get the city's crack addicts into precious treatment slots. The reward is found, not only in Mr Massing's accounts of wasted lives rescued through treatment, but also in hard economics. According to a 1992 study conducted by California's Rand Corporation, treatment is seven times better at reducing cocaine consumption in America than domestic law enforcement and an astonishing 23 times more effective than blasting foreign drug sources. Mr Massing advocates a rebalancing of the nation's drug budget, with half of its resources allocated to treatment and education, out of the pocket of supply-side control. Drug warriors certainly challenge this balance of power. An increased investment in treatment or harm reduction will not singlehandedly solve the drug problem. But at least they will not make matters worse, which the war on drugs very arguably has.  1999 FOR more than five years William Gaddis worked on his first novel, ""The Recognitions"", hoping for, and half expecting, instant success. He would not, he said later, have been ""terribly surprised"" to get the Nobel. Quick fame came to Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Why not to him? Young writers know the feeling. But ""The Recognitions"" did not even receive the kindness usually accorded to first novels. Those critics that cared to review the book said it was a dud. ""Sprawling, squalling, overwritten,"" wrote one sadist. 
Twenty years later, in 1975, Mr Gaddis ventured to publish a second novel, ""J.R"". It received ecstatic reviews. It was ""inventive and subtle"", ""wildly satiric"", ""dazzling"". Swift himself would have been happy with it. Mr Gaddis became the recipient of numerous literary prizes. ""The Recognitions"" was judged, on rereading, to be one of the most important American novels of the past 50 years. 
How can critics make such a misjudgment? Quite easily, especially if, as in the case of Mr Gaddis's writing, there are a few problems. For one thing, his books are very long. ""The Recognitions"" runs to nearly 1,000 pages, a time-consuming read for a critic whose review has to be in by tomorrow. Then, much of the narrative is in the form of conversation, but without much punctuation to help it along. It is nearer in style to James Joyce than to Jackie Collins. But with a little effort you get used to it. Mr Gaddis was a gentle innovator and against what he called the ""originality of incompetent idiots"" who ""could not do a thing the right way"". He strove to get the right words in every sentence of his mammoth novels. ""There is an obligation not to bore or to be bored yourself,"" he said. 
In the years after Mr Gaddis's appalling start, those who take an interest in new writing had time to read his work and become ""dazzled"". By the time his second book came along, he had acquired, by word of mouth in America and Europe, a reputation as a writer worth watching. The critics, suitably forewarned, read ""J.R"" more carefully. 
The wizard of Wall Street 
""JR"" is about an ii-year-old boy who goes on a school trip to Wall Street and is given a single share in order to experience the charm of ""investing in America"". He invests so astutely that he takes control of a company and makes a fortune. ""The Recognitions"" is about a clergyman's son who becomes a painter. ""Carpenter's Gothic"" is about an evangelical clergyman with an interest in helping exploited people. ""A Frolic of His Own"", is about a motorist who figures out whom to sue after arranging his own car accident. They sound the sort of tales that might be turned into films about American life. But that depends on how you see America. The Disney-sounding financial prodigy is deemed, at ii, to have the mental age of the average American adult. He is without scruples and is motivated solely by greed. The painter becomes a forger and takes the view that everything in life is a fraud. The concerned clergyman epitomises human stupidity. The motorist finds himself caught in the absurdities of American law. 
Mr Gaddis gained a view of the practical world during the years when he was unable to make a living from literature. After leaving Harvard, where he edited the Harvard Lampoon, he had a number of casual jobs, among them checking facts for the New Yorker magazine and working on a lock in the Panama canal; later, more permanently, he was doing publicity for a pharmaceutical company, working on training films for the army and writing speeches for company executives. His speeches were admired for their wit and their elegant exposition of the aims of capitalism, a feature notably absent from ""J.R"", although Mr Gaddis once said that free enterprise, for all its doubtful morality, was the least-dangerous economic system yet devised. 
William Gaddis avoided personal publicity. He gave interviews only to literary magazines that few people read. The experiences of his varied life went into his books, not on to television. An acquaintance recalled seeing him at a writers' conference which was attended by Allen Ginsberg, a selfpublicising poet who declaimed his verse accompanied by an accordion he usually carried. Mr Gaddis, by contrast, ""spoke in measured tones of the small sales that the serious novelist might expect."" It was an austere view, a rejection of the general philosophy of the book trade, which is unconcerned about whether books are read as long as they are bought. 
Even after his critical acclaim, his sales remained modest. He could never be a Hemingway, who happily advertised his colourful life. He never wrote sentimentally about being an American in Paris. He had lived there for a time and dismissed it: ""Age cannot wither, nor custom stale, her infinite vulgarity."" William Gaddis published only four books. He left a fifth, called ""Agape Agape"". Its publication date has yet to be set. There is no hurry. His admirers are a patient lot.  1999 PRICES AND WAGES In November, 12-month consumer-price inflation in the euro-il countries fell slightly, to 0.9%. Danish inflation stayed at 1.7%. Canada's inflation rate edged up to 1.2%, and Japan's to 0.8%. Denmark's producer prices fell by 2.2% in the year to November. Italian workers received a 2.3% pay rise in the year to November, a real rise of 0.8%.  1999 COMMODITY PRICE INDEX 
Our all-items dollar index slumped by 16.5% in 1998 and is now at its lowest level for five years. Both industrial and food prices have been hit by falling demand in the wake of the Asian and Russian financial crises. The metals index has fallen by 45% from its peak in January 1995. A sustained recovery in metal prices is unlikely without cuts in output. Copper is at a lZ-year low, and nickel at an ii-year low. Soft commodity prices subsided as the El Nino weather system faded; the food index is now a third below its peak in May 1997. Surpluses pushed wheat prices to zo-year lows and sugar to ten-year lows.

""NERVES"", announces the sign outside Takashi Sumioka's psychiatric clinic. Visiting a shrink is something few Japanese would admit to, but Mr Sumioka's practice has become especially busy. He specialises in treating what he calls ""restructuring syndrome"". The sufferers are mostly men and mostly middle-aged. Some have been sacked, others say they are under pressure to resign. They complain of tiredness, insomnia and depression. Japan's nerves, it seems, are shot to pieces. 
Whereas most countries would welcome an unemployment rate as low as 4.4%, Japan is finding the experience profoundly shocking. The Japanese have long been used to nearly full employment (see chart). Now more and more people are out of work-even more, probably, than the official figures suggest. Just as unsettling are changes in the way the Japanese work. In most big companies, employees thought they had jobs for life, and expected to be kept on till retirement even if they had nothing useful to do. Estimates of these surplus workers-the ""in-house unemployed""-range up to 4.5m. Even where real jobs can be found, they are being filled by temporary and part-time staff 
Japan's big exporters, the kaisha, among them Sony, Toyota and Mitsubishi, have long been reluctant to let workers go. During Japan's explosive growth, big companies did everything they could to hamper job-hopping. They paid staff strictly according to their length of service. Those who stayed until retirement got a fat cheque as a bonus, typically worth more than two years' wages. 
The government did its bit, too. Until recently, it banned temporary workers from most industries and tightly regulated any agency providing temporary staff Except for management positions, full-time jobs can only be filled through the government's own service, cheerily called Hard Waku (Hallo Work). As pensions are not portable, older workers can expect to lose up to half their benefits if they move to another company. The Japanese employers' federation reckons that, because they create such an inflexible labour market, such barriers to changing jobs account for almost three-quarters of Japan's unemployment. 
On top of that, companies could apply for ""employment-adjustment"" subsidies to avoid shedding labour. In the 198os, steel makers used these to diversify into unrelated industries, including mushroom farming and travel agencies. These subsidies are still available. In the four years to the end of 1997, they were doled out to the tune of Y176 billion ($1.6 billion). 
They have acted only to slow change. In past recessions, companies started by cutting back graduate recruitment and laying off part-time workers. As the current downturn has bitten deeper into profits, the pattern has been reversed. Cheaper part-time workers are replacing full-time sararimen (see box on next page). Once the laid-off workers could expect to land a job at small companies, which hired people during slowdowns because the labour market was otherwise too tight. Now, small companies are desperately shedding labour themselves, as record numbers of them go bust. 
None of this is doing much good to Japan's sick economy. The government expects it to shrink by z.z% this year, but even that looks too rosy. While workers fret about the future, spending in the shops continues to disappoint. The car and housing markets have collapsed. As the Diet, Japan's parliament, met this week, the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, promised to get the economy moving again. His government has pledged to create im new jobs by March 2000. But the task is bewildering, involving deregulation, a revamp of the tax and pensions systems and strengthening the social safety net. In all, it amounts to a complete overhaul of the Japanese labour market. 
A job to deregulate 
This leaves Mr Obuchi with much to do. After a long struggle, the labour ministry has at last caved in to demands to deregulate the temporary-employment agencies. The government is also thinking of extending unemployment insurance. At present, payments stop after 90-300days, depending on age and length of employment. Because of this, less than half the unemployed get any help. Proposals for a system of portable pensions are due by June. The more nebulous prospect of tax reform may slide off the government's agenda entirely. 
Then there is Mr Obuchi's plan to create im jobs, for which he is setting aside Yi trillion. So far, the government has given no details. Its record suggests it will once again pour money into the building industry through a lavish public-works programme. But jobs created this way vanish as quickly as they appear. Of the1m jobs created in the building industry between 199o and 1997, nearly half were lost when the government later cut public spending. 
Together with Rengo, a big tradesunion association, Nikkeiren has proposed some alternative ways to create jobs. These include getting the unemployed to tidy up Japan's cities and putting sacked staff into schools to teach about the world outside the classroom. More interestingly, Nikkeiren is calling for more money to be spent on Japan's housing stock; subsidies to refit houses for the elderly would, it thinks, be particularly useful, given Japan's rapidly greying population. Perhaps most promising of all is a proposal to deregulate medical care, allowing private companies for the first time into the business. America has been particularly good at creating privatesector jobs in its health-care industry. America's business services are also seen as a model. These have blossomed as big companies have contracted out everything from accounting to catering. 
With the right measures, Japan might be able to replicate some of America's successes. But an earlier plan by Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister, to create 7.4m new jobs by 2010 has already been derailed, because vested interests and bureaucratic infighting blocked deregulation. Yet the alternative is bleak. Japan's companies, even its best exporters, will not keep their in-house unemployed for ever. They face competition from leaner foreign rivals, and several industries, such as finance and telecoms, are less protected than they were. If nerves are fraying now, imagine the angst if unemployment tripled. ","With ever more people jobless,Japan is rethinking the nature of employment

He specialises in treating what he calls ""restructuring syndrome"". The sufferers are mostly men and mostly middle-aged. Some have been sacked, others say they are under pressure to resign. They complain of tiredness, insomnia and depression. Japan's nerves, it seems, are shot to pieces. 
Whereas most countries would welcome an unemployment rate as low as 4.4%, Japan is finding the experience profoundly shocking. The Japanese have long been used to nearly full employment (see chart). Now more and more people are out of work-even more, probably, than the official figures suggest. Just as unsettling are changes in the way the Japanese work. In most big companies, employees thought they had jobs for life, and expected to be kept on till retirement even if they had nothing useful to do. Estimates of these surplus workers-the ""in-house unemployed""-range up to 4.5m. Even where real jobs can be found, they are being filled by temporary and part-time staff 
Japan's big exporters, the kaisha, among them Sony, Toyota and Mitsubishi, have long been reluctant to let workers go. During Japan's explosive growth, big companies did everything they could to hamper job-hopping. They paid staff strictly according to their length of service. Those who stayed until retirement got a fat cheque as a bonus, typically worth more than two years' wages. 
The government did its bit, too. Until recently, it banned temporary workers from most industries and tightly regulated any agency providing temporary staff Except for management positions, full-time jobs can only be filled through the government's own service, cheerily called Hard Waku (Hallo Work). As pensions are not portable, older workers can expect to lose up to half their benefits if they move to another company. The Japanese employers' federation reckons that, because they create such an inflexible labour market, such barriers to changing jobs account for almost three-quarters of Japan's unemployment. 
On top of that, companies could apply for ""employment-adjustment"" subsidies to avoid shedding labour. In the 198os, steel makers used these to diversify into unrelated industries, including mushroom farming and travel agencies. These subsidies are still available. In the four years to the end of 1997, they were doled out to the tune of Y176 billion ($1.6 billion). 
They have acted only to slow change. In past recessions, companies started by cutting back graduate recruitment and laying off part-time workers. As the current downturn has bitten deeper into profits, the pattern has been reversed. Cheaper part-time workers are replacing full-time sararimen (see box on next page). Once the laid-off workers could expect to land a job at small companies, which hired people during slowdowns because the labour market was otherwise too tight. Now, small companies are desperately shedding labour themselves, as record numbers of them go bust. 
None of this is doing much good to Japan's sick economy. The government expects it to shrink by z.z% this year, but even that looks too rosy. While workers fret about the future, spending in the shops continues to disappoint. The car and housing markets have collapsed. As the Diet, Japan's parliament, met this week, the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, promised to get the economy moving again. His government has pledged to create im new jobs by March 2000. But the task is bewildering, involving deregulation, a revamp of the tax and pensions systems and strengthening the social safety net. In all, it amounts to a complete overhaul of the Japanese labour market. 
A job to deregulate 
This leaves Mr Obuchi with much to do. After a long struggle, the labour ministry has at last caved in to demands to deregulate the temporary-employment agencies. The government is also thinking of extending unemployment insurance. At present, payments stop after 90-300days, depending on age and length of employment. Because of this, less than half the unemployed get any help. Proposals for a system of portable pensions are due by June. The more nebulous prospect of tax reform may slide off the government's agenda entirely. 
Then there is Mr Obuchi's plan to create im jobs, for which he is setting aside Yi trillion. So far, the government has given no details. Its record suggests it will once again pour money into the building industry through a lavish public-works programme. But jobs created this way vanish as quickly as they appear. Of the1m jobs created in the building industry between 199o and 1997, nearly half were lost when the government later cut public spending. 
Together with Rengo, a big tradesunion association, Nikkeiren has proposed some alternative ways to create jobs. These include getting the unemployed to tidy up Japan's cities and putting sacked staff into schools to teach about the world outside the classroom. More interestingly, Nikkeiren is calling for more money to be spent on Japan's housing stock; subsidies to refit houses for the elderly would, it thinks, be particularly useful, given Japan's rapidly greying population. Perhaps most promising of all is a proposal to deregulate medical care, allowing private companies for the first time into the business. America has been particularly good at creating privatesector jobs in its health-care industry. America's business services are also seen as a model. These have blossomed as big companies have contracted out everything from accounting to catering. 
With the right measures, Japan might be able to replicate some of America's successes. But an earlier plan by Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister, to create 7.4m new jobs by 2010 has already been derailed, because vested interests and bureaucratic infighting blocked deregulation. Yet the alternative is bleak. Japan's companies, even its best exporters, will not keep their in-house unemployed for ever. They face competition from leaner foreign rivals, and several industries, such as finance and telecoms, are less protected than they were. If nerves are fraying now, imagine the angst if unemployment tripled. ",740,Japan,A29-8197,,False,,0,True

WHEN she visited fire-ravaged Tasmania on January 7th Julia Gillard, Australia's prime minister, flew into one of the country's worst-ever heatwaves. Back on the mainland, Ms Gillard prepared for a season of political heat. Her minority Labor government faces an election in the second half of the year. And already it has been forced to ditch a key pledge that it had hoped would sell to voters its credentials as a strong economic manager: a budget surplus for 2012-13. 
The treasurer, Wayne Swan, promised the surplus three years ago, ""come hell or high water"". Last May he delivered a budget with a wafer-thin surplus of A$1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) for the fiscal year beginning in July. By October even that forecast had been shaved, to A$1.1 billion. But last month Mr Swan faced journalists to confess that a surplus was now unlikely. He blamed a revenue shortfall of almost A$4 billion in the first four months of the fiscal year, thanks largely to a slump in the prices of several commodities, a usually solid source of tax revenues. 
Prices of iron ore, the country's biggest export, have since recovered a bit. But the surplus pledge always had a whiff of politics to it. It was to be the government's exclamation mark after guiding Australia through a global downturn without tipping into recession. But clinging to the promise amid uncertainty, and possibly resorting to tax increases and spending cuts in order to deliver it, posed too big a political risk in an election year. 
Economists broadly welcome the change. The surplus, says Paul Bloxham, chief economist for HSBC in Australia, was always an unrealistic goal. Mr Swan has not mentioned a deficit, let alone ventured a figure for one. Yet broad predictions now see the budget about A$10 billion in the red. After a deficit the previous year of almost A$44 billion, that would not seem too bad. Whether it plays that way with voters remains to be seen. Tony Abbott, leader of the conservative Liberal-National opposition, vows to pursue Ms Gillard over her broken promise. His attempts to hound her for breaking another promise, not to introduce a carbon tax, have lost steam since the tax took effect in July. 
A Nielsen opinion poll in December gave the opposition a four-point lead after second-preference votes. But Mr Abbott has problems of his own. At 63%, his disapproval rating makes him the second most unpopular opposition leader in the poll's history. Ms Gillard's disapproval stands at a mere 50%, and she leads Mr Abbott by ten points as preferred prime minister. Next month will mark the first anniversary of her comfortable defeat of a challenge to her leadership by Kevin Rudd, whom she unseated as Labor leader and prime minister in mid-2010. Voters still seem to like Mr Rudd more than Ms Gillard. But unless Labor's polls dive badly as the election approaches, his lingering hopes of another challenge will probably fade. 
Ms Gillard won further breathing-space in December, when a court dismissed a sexual-harassment case against a former parliamentary speaker, Peter Slipper, by one of his staff members. Ms Gillard's appointment in late 2011 of Mr Slipper, a turncoat Liberal, deprived the opposition of a vote. Before the judgment, Mr Abbott and his colleagues paraded the Slipper affair to embarrass Ms Gillard. But the judgment was scathing. It found that the main purpose of the staffer, James Ashby, in launching the case was to bring down Mr Slipper and to help Mal Brough, an opposition candidate, get Mr Slipper's parliamentary seat. The judge branded the case an abuse of legal process. Mr Slipper is due to face court next month over separate allegations of misusing parliamentary travel expenses. 
If Ms Gillard can avoid more sensations and even turn the broken pledge of a budget surplus to her government's political advantage, she will enter the election race in a more competitive position than seemed possible a year ago. The economy is forecast to grow by 3% this year. Unemployment remains a tad above 5%. And last month the central bank cut interest rates to 3%, which should offer scope for much-needed investment outside Australia's booming mining regions.","The government drops its promise of a budget surplus

IN FEW countries do history and geography tug in such different directions. It is half a century since Japan overtook Britain as Australia's largest trading partner, itself to be overtaken by another Asian giant, China, in 2007. More than 40 years have passed since ""White Australia"" immigration policies were dropped and Australia began to look a little more like Asia. And it is 16 years since an Australian prime minister, John Howard, claimed ""we do not have to choose between our history and our geography."" 
It is only three months, however, since Australia's government produced a white paper on ""Australia in the Asian Century"", which has provoked renewed debate about Australia's place in its closest neighbourhood. As Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister, says, Australians feel they live ""slightly on the edge"", a feeling heightened by extreme natural events, such as the recent heatwave and accompanying bushfires. 
Their head of state is still the British queen and their security is founded on a treaty with America. Indeed, by agreeing to play host to up to 2,500 American marines, Australia is central to the Obama administration's ""rebalancing"" to Asia. And most of Australia's foreign investment is still from America and Europe. A poll last year by the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, found that 95% of Australians thought China already was, or would become, ""Asia's leading power""; 52% felt uncomfortable about it. 
The upshot of months of bureaucratic arm-wrestling between independent experts and various government departments, the white paper offers a predictably awestruck view of Asia's economic rise. By the early 2020s Asia will overtake the combined economic output of Europe and North America. The white paper offers an exhaustive list of recommendations as to how Australia can take advantage of this (it was even more exhaustive before it was drastically pruned, in a late fit of editing, to a mere 312 pages). These cover everything from education, with every Australian school to be linked to one in Asia by 2025, to the transformation of the civil service and even corporate boards by ensuring one-third of their members are ""Asia-literate"". 
The plea to Australians to wake up to Asia's potential recalls the efforts of governments in the 1980s and 1990s to rebrand Australia as an ""Asian country"". But the context has changed utterly. Back then Australia was languishing and a booming Asia enjoyed condescending to it. In 1980 Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's patriarch, warned Australians that they risked becoming ""the poor white trash of Asia"". In 1986 an Australian finance minister (and later prime minister), Paul Keating, fretted that without reform the country might become a ""banana republic"". 
In contrast, 2013 is expected to be Australia's 22nd consecutive year of economic growth. It weathered the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, contributing to the bail-outs of Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. And, uniquely among developed economies, it survived the global financial crisis without a recession. Australia has a new self-confidence in its own economic model. A book published last year by an Australian journalist, George Megalogenis (""The Australian Moment""), argues that, thanks to the economic reforms undertaken over the past three decades, Australia is ""more versatile today than any other first-world nation"", and that ""it's our turn to tell them how the world works"". 
Asia's relative economic importance also looks greater than ever. That is partly because of the recent troubles of the developed economies and partly because India has joined the region's fast-growth club. But mainly it is because of the continued expansion of the Chinese economy. China now takes about 29% of Australia's exports, mostly energy and minerals. The white paper argues Australia has to ready itself for the day when it cannot prosper simply by digging stuff up and selling it to China. It needs to excel in providing the services a growing Asian middle class will need--such as education and tourism. 
The domestic political context has also changed. Not only are ethnic Asians now an important electoral constituency, but the prolonged Asia-led boom means that politicians have to compete to prove their ""Asia-literacy"". So for Julia Gillard, the prime minister, commissioning the white paper was one card she can play in the election to be held later this year. It may also have been an attempt to steal some of the Asian clothes of Mr Rudd, the Mandarin-speaker she toppled in a Labor party coup in 2010. To counter impressions that he has a bias to the ""anglosphere"", her probable opponent in the election, Tony Abbott, leader of the conservative opposition coalition, has said that as prime minister his policy would have ""more Jakarta, less Geneva"". His deputy and prospective foreign minister, Julie Bishop, picks holes in the white paper (""a missed opportunity and potentially counter-productive"") but concedes that its goals and targets are ""laudable"". 
One analyst, however, levels two related criticisms at it. The first is that it amounts to an ""enormous one-way bet"" on a rising Asia, and Australia should be worrying more about unforeseen shocks. The second is that the paper does not squarely confront changes to the security environment. It accepts that a ""natural, legitimate outcome"" of China's growth will be increased military strength, and expresses optimism that China and America can ""manage strategic change"". 
...but in the middle 
In a public document, one would expect little else, and just this week the government delivered a separate national security strategy. But in Australia as elsewhere in Asia, the mismatch between growing economic dependence on China and security reliance on America looks uncomfortable. Under Mr Rudd, Australia was key to the expansion of the annual East Asia Summit into a security forum which both China and America attend. Few countries have a greater interest in seeing the Pacific's two big powers get along, and history reconcile itself with geography.","Australia still does not seem entirely sure where it is

FARMERS and townsfolk in the Manning River valley north of Sydney gathered on February 2nd to show their political strength. Through the Manning Alliance, a rural protest group, they had already stopped an electricity company from plonking a network of giant power pylons across their farms. Now they demanded safeguards for soil and rivers in light of an issue that is likely to feature in Australia's forthcoming federal election: the mining of gas from underground coal seams across New South Wales, the country's most populous state. Rob Oakeshott, the region's MP, an independent, told the crowd in Wingham that ""traditional political structures"" were failing communities like theirs. The town hall audience erupted with applause. 
Since the election three years ago, parliamentary support from Mr Oakeshott and from Tony Windsor, another rural independent, has kept the minority Labor government headed by Julia Gillard, the prime minister, in power. As a reward for their support, the men last year won legislation for a scientific committee to assess the impact of coal-seam gas mining on rivers such as the Manning. 
Mr Oakeshott frets over the committee's fate should the conservative coalition opposition win on September 14th: Tony Abbott, the leader of the opposition, pledges that one of his first acts in government will be to abolish the taxes on carbon emissions and mining profits which Ms Gillard pushed through. 
When she announced the election date on January 30th, Ms Gillard hoped to capture the political momentum. She broke a convention whereby Australian prime ministers have announced election dates just a few weeks before polls. In setting the date seven-and-a-half months ahead, she calculated that the opposition's policy-free zones would show it in an unflattering light. Instead, unwelcome attention has turned to her own government. 
On the day that Mr Oakeshott addressed the Manning rally, the political class in Canberra, the capital, was rocked by the resignations of two Gillard government ministers: Nicola Roxon, the attorney-general, and Chris Evans, the government's leader in the upper house. Both ministers had in private signalled their plans to retire from politics before the election. But for Ms Gillard, the timing was awkward. She was already feeling the sting from two unrelated Labor scandals. 
In the first, on January 31st, Craig Thomson, a former federal Labor parliamentarian, was arrested on fraud charges dating from his time as head of the health-services union; he appeared briefly in a Melbourne court on February 6th to deny the charges. Mr Thomson now sits as an independent, but still supports the government. His arrest does not directly threaten its parliamentary survival, but it diverts attention from Labor's case for re-election. 
The second scandal centres on a corruption inquiry into the business dealings of a former Labor minister in the state government of New South Wales, Eddie Obeid. It is proving a gift to Ms Gillard's opponents. Mr Obeid was in the past a key Labor powerbroker. This scandal could swing the general election outcome in New South Wales and perhaps the country as a whole. 
Opinion polls late last year showed the government clawing its way back into a competitive race. But a poll on February 4th, the first since Ms Gillard announced the election date, seemed to show that the dramas had reversed any gains: after second-preference votes, the government trailed the opposition by 12 points. The twists in the government's fortunes have prompted the media, yet again, to speculate on a comeback by Kevin Rudd, the former leader whom Ms Gillard defenestrated before the previous election. Mr Rudd says those excited by such speculation should take a ""long, cold shower"".

ONE thing that sets Australia apart from its Asian neighbours is the interminable, vicious public infighting that scars its politics. On March 25th Julia Gillard, the prime minister, shuffled her cabinet for the fourth time since scraping home in an election in August 2010. She purged it of supporters of Kevin Rudd, her predecessor, whom some of her Labor Party colleagues had tried and failed to install as her replacement on March 21st. Australian commentators wrung their hands at the tawdry politicking. ""Our long national nightmare continues,"" lamented Sam Roggeveen on a blog on the website of the Lowy Institute, a foreign-affairs think-tank in Sydney, fretting that Australia was becoming a laughing-stock. It is true that its politics provokes a smirk or two elsewhere in Asia. Few could argue with Ms Gillard's assessment that the coup attempt was ""unseemly"" and ""self-indulgent"". 
The Labor Party's troubles date back to Mr Rudd's stint as prime minister, from 2007-10. He alienated his colleagues and was losing popularity, so the party toppled him ahead of the 2010 election. Many were taken aback both by the suddenness of his downfall, and the ruthlessness with which Ms Gillard knifed him. He seems never to have given up hope of a comeback. A Mandarin-speaking former diplomat, in public he is an appealing character: erudite, eloquent, witty and even, on occasion, self-deprecating. In opinion polls he has consistently scored much higher than Ms Gillard as the leader who might secure victory in the next election, which she has called for September 14th. 
The sad truth for Mr Rudd, however, is that many of his Labor parliamentary colleagues, who choose the leader, cannot stand him. According to James Button, who worked briefly as a speechwriter for Mr Rudd, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, ""behind closed doors he consistently treated people with rudeness and contempt."" He had no chance of unseating Ms Gillard and, for the second time in their three leadership contests, did not even compete in the leadership ballot she called. Hence the ""Chicken Kev"" taunt thrown by another columnist and former Labor speechwriter, Tim Soutphommasane. 
Ms Gillard, on the other hand, a former industrial-relations lawyer with strong ties to the trade unions that back Labor, has again shown her toughness. In a recent interview with the Canberra Times she said that, in politics, you have to be ""a pretty hard bastard"". Tony Blair, a former British prime minister dogged by intraparty conspiracies, had told her politics was afflicted with a ""new brutality"". She spoke of how technology has transformed the media, encouraging ""more drama, more shock, more horror"". 
At least now Mr Rudd has promised Ms Gillard his ""100% support"". Even if he had his fingers crossed when he spoke, Ms Gillard can probably concentrate for the next six months on fighting the opposition rather than looking over her shoulder. Still, if the opinion polls are to be believed, she needs quite a turnaround to avoid a humiliating defeat in September. 
Perhaps her best hope is that the conservative opposition coalition has as self-destructive a recent history as Labor's. Its leading force, the Liberal Party, has had four leaders in the past six years. Tony Abbott, the incumbent and probable coalition candidate for prime minister, is not its most popular politician. The man he ousted in 2009, Malcolm Turnbull, is a bigger vote-winner. Ms Gillard, whose finest moment as prime minister was a blistering attack last year on Mr Abbott for alleged misogyny, may feel she still has a chance. 
Australian politics seems locked in a culture of democratic coups, with the perverse effect that the leading parties fail to field their best candidates. And, when not dominated by tales of back-stabbing leaders and their muck-spreading sidekicks, they are taken over by scandals of sleaze and graft. 
Asia's big democracies--India, Indonesia and Japan--have all faced difficulties in finding leaders acceptable both to their parties and to the electorate. India's Congress party seems likely to resort, by default, to a dynastic succession; the most popular politician in Indonesia, Joko Widodo, Jakarta's governor, is not yet even a candidate in next year's presidential election; Japan is on its seventh prime minister in seven years (and it is his second go in that period). In all three countries politics is even more unseemly, self-indulgent and even corrupt. 
Just like the Politburo 
This sounds like an advertisement for autocracy. On a superficial view, China, for example, does not suffer from this leadership instability. One ten-year regime has just given way, in a choreographed transition, to another, expected to endure until 2022. But in fact, Chinese politics also closely resembles Australia's. There, too, no politician forgets that, as Mr Rudd put it in 1998, ""politics is about power"". There, too, leaders are chosen by factional intrigue. There, too, politics is dominated by personal rivalry. And there, too, the public's preferences are of secondary importance. 
The difference is that Australia's politics is played out in the open. Uniquely in the rich world, Australia is enjoying its 22nd consecutive year of economic growth. If this is a national nightmare, who wants to wake up? Moreover, as Mr Roggeveen forecast, the leadership kerfuffle played out peacefully according to the rules of Australia's democracy: ""No troops on the streets and probably not even a demonstration."" Australia may in fact be Asia's most stable country. 
By comparison, China's politics inhabits the shadows, except when some scandal, such as the Bo Xilai affair last year, casts a lurid light. And when that happens it calls the whole closed system into question. As Mr Roggeveen noted a day after his doom-laden blogpost, the latest Rudd-Gillard tussle did not make Australia a laughing-stock after all. It was widely seen as a non-event. It must be chastening for Australia's leaders that their squabbles seem irrelevant. But it is also a lesson in the benefits of transparency.","Politics in Australia is not as unAsian as it appears 
 ONE thing that sets Australia apart from its Asian neighbours is the interminable , vicious public infighting that scars its politics . On March 25th Julia Gillard , the prime minister , shuffled her cabinet for the fourth time since scraping home in an election in August 2010 . She purged it of supporters of Kevin Rudd's . Australian commentators wrung their hands at the tawdry politicking . "" Our long national nightmare continues , "" lamented Sam Roggeveen on a blog on the website of the Lowy Institute , a foreign - affairs think - tank in Sydney , fretting that Australia was becoming a laughing - stock . It is true that its politics provokes a smirk or two elsewhere in Asia . Few could argue with Ms Gillard 's assessment that the coup attempt was "" unseemly "" and "" self - indulgent "" . 
 The Labor Party 's troubles date back to Kevin Rudd's stint as prime minister , from 2007 - 10 . Kevin Rudd alienated Kevin Rudd's colleagues and was losing popularity , so the party toppled Kevin Rudd ahead of the 2010 election . Many were taken aback both by the suddenness of Kevin Rudd's downfall , and the ruthlessness with which Ms Gillard knifed Kevin Rudd . Kevin Rudd seems never to have given up hope of a comeback . Kevin Rudd , in public Kevin Rudd is an appealing character : erudite , eloquent , witty and even , on occasion , self - deprecating . In opinion polls Kevin Rudd has consistently scored much higher than Ms Gillard as the leader who might secure victory in the next election , which she has called for September 14th . 
 The sad truth for Kevin Rudd , however , is that many of Kevin Rudd's Labor parliamentary colleagues , who choose the leader , can not stand Kevin Rudd . According to James Button , who worked briefly as a speechwriter for Kevin Rudd , writing in the Sydney Morning Herald , "" behind closed doors Kevin Rudd consistently treated people with rudeness and contempt . "" Kevin Rudd had no chance of unseating Ms Gillard and , for the second time in their three leadership contests , did not even compete in the leadership ballot she called . Hence the "" Chicken Kev "" taunt thrown by another columnist and former Labor speechwriter , Tim Soutphommasane . 
 Ms Gillard , on the other hand , a former industrial - relations lawyer with strong ties to the trade unions that back Labor , has again shown her toughness . In a recent interview with the Canberra Times she said that , in politics , you have to be "" a pretty hard bastard "" . Tony Blair , a former British prime minister dogged by intraparty conspiracies , had told her politics was afflicted with a "" new brutality "" . She spoke of how technology has transformed the media , encouraging "" more drama , more shock , more horror "" . 
 At least now Kevin Rudd has promised Ms Gillard Kevin Rudd's "" 100 % support "" . Even if Kevin Rudd had Kevin Rudd's fingers crossed when Kevin Rudd spoke , Ms Gillard can probably concentrate for the next six months on fighting the opposition rather than looking over her shoulder . Still , if the opinion polls are to be believed , she needs quite a turnaround to avoid a humiliating defeat in September . 
 Perhaps her best hope is that the conservative opposition coalition has as self - destructive a recent history as Labor 's . Its leading force , the Liberal Party , has had four leaders in the past six years . Tony Abbott , the incumbent and probable coalition candidate for prime minister , is not its most popular politician . The man he ousted in 2009 , Malcolm Turnbull , is a bigger vote - winner . Ms Gillard , whose finest moment as prime minister was a blistering attack last year on Mr Abbott for alleged misogyny , may feel she still has a chance . 
 Australian politics seems locked in a culture of democratic coups , with the perverse effect that the leading parties fail to field their best candidates . And , when not dominated by tales of back - stabbing leaders and their muck - spreading sidekicks , they are taken over by scandals of sleaze and graft . 
 Asia 's big democracies -- India , Indonesia and Japan -- have all faced difficulties in finding leaders acceptable both to their parties and to the electorate . India 's Congress party seems likely to resort , by default , to a dynastic succession ; the most popular politician in Indonesia , Joko Widodo , Jakarta 's governor , is not yet even a candidate in next year 's presidential election ; Japan is on its seventh prime minister in seven years ( and it is his second go in that period ) . In all three countries politics is even more unseemly , self - indulgent and even corrupt . 
 Just like the Politburo 
 This sounds like an advertisement for autocracy . On a superficial view , China , for example , does not suffer from this leadership instability . One ten - year regime has just given way , in a choreographed transition , to another , expected to endure until 2022 . But in fact , Chinese politics also closely resembles Australia 's . There , too , no politician forgets that , as Kevin Rudd put it in 1998 , "" politics is about power "" . There , too , leaders are chosen by factional intrigue . There , too , politics is dominated by personal rivalry . And there , too , the public 's preferences are of secondary importance . 
 The difference is that Australia 's politics is played out in the open . Uniquely in the rich world , Australia is enjoying its 22nd consecutive year of economic growth . If this is a national nightmare , who wants to wake up ? Moreover , as Mr Roggeveen forecast , the leadership kerfuffle played out peacefully according to the rules of Australia 's democracy : "" No troops on the streets and probably not even a demonstration . "" Australia may in fact be Asia 's most stable country . 
 By comparison , China 's politics inhabits the shadows , except when some scandal , such as the Bo Xilai affair last year , casts a lurid light . And when that happens it calls the whole closed system into question . As Mr Roggeveen noted a day after his doom - laden blogpost , the latest Rudd - Gillard tussle did not make Australia a laughing - stock after all . It was widely seen as a non - event . It must be chastening for Australia 's leaders that their squabbles seem irrelevant .

It ruled that the federal Defence of Marriage Act, signed in 1996, was unconstitutional in denying the same benefits to gay couples as heterosexual ones in the 13 states where same-sex marriage is legal. And it declined to uphold a challenge to gay marriage in California. Jerry Brown, California's governor, immediately ordered counties there to issue marriage licences to gay couples. 
The Supreme Court also struck down a part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that had required several states and counties to get federal pre-approval for any changes to their election laws. And it sent a case on affirmative action back to the lower courts to look again at whether race-based college admissions at the University of Texas are constitutional. 
Barack Obama outlined a plan to reduce America's greenhouse gases, including new requirements to reduce carbon emissions at power plants and more funding for renewable energy. Because any climate-change bill is likely to fail in Congress, the president issued his plan through executive fiat. He also said that he would approve the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to the Gulf coast, but only if it does not ""significantly exacerbate"" carbon pollution.

The latest from the streets 
Brazil's government promised a package of reforms and public spending in a bid to defuse the country's biggest protests in more than 20 years. Demonstrations about public services, corruption and World Cup waste continued, but were smaller than recent ones. 
America formally charged Edward Snowden with espionage for leaking classified material about the intelligence agencies' surveillance programme. Mr Snowden, meanwhile, fled Hong Kong and surfaced in the transit lounge at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Ecuador, which has also offered shelter to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, says he has applied for asylum there. 
Sweet revenge 
Kevin Rudd ousted Julia Gillard as the leader of Australia's Labor Party and thus as the country's prime minister, exacting revenge on his former deputy, who had deposed him as prime minister in 2010. Ms Gillard's supporters claim she had been vilified by Australia's macho press. She is leaving politics. A general election is due later this year. 
Taliban militants attacked security forces near the presidential palace in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, as well as the CIA's headquarters in the city. In spite of this, the American and Afghan presidents reaffirmed their support for holding talks with the Taliban. 
Chinese state media reported that gangs armed with knives attacked a police station and a local government building in China's restive north-western region of Xinjiang. At least 27 people were killed. The reason for the violence was not immediately clear but clashes frequently occur between ethnic Uighurs and security forces in the region. 
The death toll from flooding and landslides in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand passed 1,000, with thousands of people still missing. 
The president of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, apologised to Malaysia and Singapore for haze caused by fires used to clear land in Sumatra. The smog has caused record pollution in Singapore. 
Dangerous days 
Tension rose across Egypt, with fears of violence at demonstrations against the government of President Muhammad Morsi planned for June 30th, the first anniversary of his inauguration. The minister of defence hinted that the army might have to intervene if the chaos worsened.

AS ANNIVERSARIES go, it could hardly have been unhappier. On June 24th, Julia Gillard marked three years since she overthrew Kevin Rudd as leader of the ruling Labor Party and became Australia's first female prime minister. Her coup never achieved its purpose of steering Labor into safer electoral waters. Two days after her anniversary, Mr Rudd finally took his revenge. With their party predicted to lose a federal election due on September 14th, panicked Labor parliamentarians dumped Ms Gillard and reinstalled him as leader. This was their fourth leadership showdown in three turbulent years. Having triumphed over Mr Rudd in the first three, Ms Gillard lost by 45 votes to 57. 
She called the ballot on June 26th to pre-empt a move against her by Mr Rudd's supporters. Mr Rudd had launched an undeclared leadership campaign, as frantic press speculation and dire opinion polls threatened to destabilise the party. Raising the stakes, Ms Gillard insisted that the loser quit politics at the forthcoming election. When she lost, she kept her word: she will not recontest her Melbourne constituency, bringing to an end a dazzling but controversial 15-year parliamentary career. 
After Mr Rudd was sworn in again as prime minister on June 27th, the victory glow quickly dulled. Six of Ms Gillard's ministers resigned, declaring they could not work with him. They included Wayne Swan and Greg Combet, who held the vital posts of treasurer and climate-change minister respectively. Penny Wong, the finance minister and another Gillard supporter, stays on as government leader in the Senate, the upper house. As he chose a new cabinet, Mr Rudd also scrambled to keep the parliamentary votes of five independents, on whose support Ms Gillard's minority government had depended. 
The Rudd revival capped one of the most dramatic eras in Australian politics. Mr Rudd was a Labor hero after he led the party to power in 2007, ending 11 years of rule by a conservative coalition. But his autocratic style alienated many colleagues. Mark Latham, a former Labor leader, calls him a ""phenomenal egotist"" who ""looks at politics through the prism of vanity"". 
When Ms Gillard took his job, critics predicted an early death for her minority government. She proved them wrong. The parliament survived its three-year term, passed more than 500 bills and endorsed Ms Gillard's pet policies: a new financial deal for schools and an insurance scheme for disabled Australians. Yet many Australians, bewildered by the knifing of a prime minister before his first term was up, never warmed to her. Mr Rudd played on his martyr-like popularity in the wider electorate, and relished Ms Gillard's struggle to stamp herself as a legitimate leader. She revealed her frustration when she called the latest leadership ballot. As well as fighting Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, she said, ""I've also been in a political contest with people from my own party."" 
Some of Ms Gillard's backers reckon sexism also stalked her prime ministership. In her book ""The Misogyny Factor"", Anne Summers, a feminist editor, says Ms Gillard has been ""fair game for anyone in Australia who objects to our having a woman in charge"". A week before the leadership crisis, a story emerged of sexist jokes about her printed on a menu at a recent fundraising event for an opposition candidate in Queensland. After her downfall, Ms Gillard said a focus on ""gender wars"" during her prime ministership would make it easier for other women to follow in the job. ""I'm proud of that."" 
Mr Rudd seemed to prepare the ground for his putsch last month when he dropped his opposition to gay marriage, which polls show is supported by a majority of Australians but is opposed by Ms Gillard. He pounced after two fresh election opinion polls showed Labor's support at 29%. This suggested that Labor could lose almost half its 71 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives. One poll showed Labor's vote rising to neck-and-neck with the opposition, after the distribution of second-preference votes, if it restored Mr Rudd as leader. 
After the party did so, Mr Rudd acknowledged Ms Gillard as a ""remarkable reformer"". But he said Australians wanted a ""real choice"" against Mr Abbott. Mr Rudd has been a formidable campaigner before. He is likely to focus on Labor's strengths: the economy, education and health. Mr Abbott's policies on all are woolly. Mr Rudd will also aim to blunt Mr Abbott's campaign against Ms Gillard's carbon tax to fight climate change. The business world welcomed Mr Rudd's return. Whether it proves an election-winning gambit with the voters is another question.","For the second time in three years , Labor ousts an election - winning leader

Then he flew almost 3,000km (1,800 miles) to the Northern Territory for the state funeral of an aboriginal man, a notable singer known as Mr Yunupingu. 
In restoring Mr Rudd and defenestrating Ms Gillard, Labor parliamentarians hoped to cut the opposition's crushing lead in opinion polls. Their gamble shows early promise. A poll on July 1st showed Labor's support six points higher than a week earlier, when Ms Gillard was prime minister, though the government was still behind after second preference votes were distributed. Mr Rudd, on the other hand, grabbed a 14-point lead over Mr Abbott as preferred prime minister, compared with Ms Gillard's earlier 12-point deficit. 
The poll, and the cabinet departures, highlight the conundrum Mr Rudd will have to solve if he hopes to lead Labor back to power. Although many voters prefer him to Ms Gillard, plenty of his colleagues despair of his micromanagement--autocratic but not often decisive--which was on display when he was prime minister in 2007-10. The opposition has already prepared a video for YouTube of his colleagues citing ""dysfunction"", ""contempt for the cabinet"" and other bitter memories. 
Mr Rudd's ousting of Australia's first woman prime minister could also hurt him with some voters. On the other hand, six women sit in the new cabinet. Some ministers, such as Chris Bowen, the new treasurer, supported him in previous leadership battles, but others are new faces. Mr Rudd protests that he has learned from his past mistakes and that he will listen better to his ministers. After the first cabinet meeting Tanya Plibersek, who survived in her job as health minister, said Mr Rudd had taken a ""very collegiate"" approach. 
He will need more of that as he seeks to fix some policies that had made Ms Gillard unpopular, including a carbon tax and dealing with asylum-seekers arriving by boat. But at least Mr Rudd has shown that Mr Abbott can no longer expect the election to be a cakewalk.","Kevin Rudd says Kevin Rudd's bad old ways are history

JUST before he was dumped as leader of the Labor Party and prime minister three years ago, Kevin Rudd warned his colleagues against ""lurching to the right"" over asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat. Less than four weeks after he seized his old job back, Mr Rudd ditched his own advice. With Peter O'Neill, prime minister of Papua New Guinea (PNG), at his side, Mr Rudd declared on July 19th that all boat people pitching up on Australia's shores from now on would be sent to PNG, Australia's nearest northern neighbour. Even if they prove to be ""genuine refugees"", they will have ""no chance"" of a new life in Australia. Instead, they will be resettled in PNG, one of the Pacific's poorest countries. 
Facing an election this year, Mr Rudd has set about clawing back support over two issues that had damaged Julia Gillard, his predecessor: a carbon tax to deal with climate change, and rising numbers of boat people. So far this year more than 16,000 asylum-seekers on 220 boats have arrived, almost as many as in all of 2012. Tony Abbott, leader of the conservative opposition, has scored points in Labor's heartland with two slogans: ""Axe the tax"" and ""Stop the boats"". If elected as prime minister, he pledges to turn boats back to Indonesia, their main embarkation point. 
On July 16th Mr Rudd declared that the government would ""terminate"" the carbon tax next year and switch to a floating-price emissions-trading scheme, a year earlier than first planned. On the boats, he admits his ""regional resettlement arrangement"" with PNG is a ""very hardline decision"". Some refugee-law experts go further. James Hathaway, of the University of Melbourne, calls it the ""most bizarre overreaction"". He reckons refugees are paying the price for Mr Rudd's ""wanting to appear more butch than Julia Gillard and more reactionary than Tony Abbott"". Australia does not have an asylum problem, says Mr Hathaway. ""It has a political problem."" 
The figures bear him out. Political leaders of all stripes tend to underrate Australia's capacity to absorb outsiders. Last year the country admitted almost 200,000 immigrants. Most of the 47,000 boat people of the past five years were found to be ""genuine refugees"". In 2011 Australia received 3% of asylum applications lodged in industrialised countries, a proportion roughly in line with its population. 
The corrosive politics over asylum started with John Howard, a former conservative prime minister. In 2001 he opened camps for boat people in Nauru and on Manus Island in PNG. He hailed this as a ""Pacific Solution"". In his first stint as prime minister, Mr Rudd closed the camps. 
Australia has since processed most boat people on its Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island, near Indonesia. But Ms Gillard when prime minister, facing opposition alarm over the boats, grabbed a lifeline offered by an expert panel. It suggested reopening the camps in a bid to deter boats and save lives. The lifeline neither saved Ms Gillard's prime ministership nor stopped boats and drownings. Just this week at least nine people drowned, 180 were rescued and an unknown number were missing after a boat sank off the Indonesian island of Java. Over 1,000 people are thought to have drowned trying to reach Australia in the past ten years. Iran, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are now the main sources of asylum-seekers. 
Since their hasty reopening last year, the camps have proved politically more explosive than ever. Much of the Nauru one burned down in a riot among its 544 detainees on July 19th. And after an outcry earlier this year about the children held at the Manus Island camp in PNG, Australia moved them and their families to Christmas Island and the Australian mainland. After a visit to Manus Island in June, the UN's refugee agency reported that conditions were still below international standards. On July 23rd Rod St George, who used to work there, told Australian television that men had been sexually and physically abused by fellow detainees. 
Mr Hathaway calls Manus Island ""the hellhole of PNG"". With Mr Rudd's PNG idea, Australia plans to expand the camp's capacity fivefold to hold about 3,000 asylum-seekers. It will also give Mr O'Neill's government more aid, on top of the A$500m ($463m) a year Australia already provides, for health, policing and university education. Ben Saul, a human-rights lawyer, reckons the PNG solution could breach the spirit of Australia's obligations under the UN's refugee convention, which stipulates that countries capable of dealing with refugee flows should not shift responsibility onto others. For Mr Rudd that seems of less importance than shoring up votes at home. He calculates that the prospect of living indefinitely in PNG will stop the boat people, where earlier lurches to the right have failed. It is a gamble.","The shadow of a looming election falls on desperate asylum - seekers

WITH his sights on the G20 leaders' summit in Russia early next month, Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, faced a conflict. Mr Rudd takes credit for boosting Australia's role in the G20, and is happy on the world stage. So after he toppled Julia Gillard as Labor Party leader and prime minister in June, Mr Rudd had hoped to put back Australia's expected date for a general election in order to glad-hand world leaders first. Yet party barons warned him not to try his luck. Famous for once ignoring advice, this time Mr Rudd listened. Dropping his travel plans, he has called an election for September 7th, the day after the summit ends. 
Mr Rudd casts himself as underdog in a five-week campaign he says will be ""pretty rough"". When they reinstalled Mr Rudd as leader, Labor power-brokers aimed to escape the electoral drubbing that opinion polls showed the government faced when Ms Gillard was prime minister. Mr Rudd led Labor to power in 2007, ending 11 years of conservative government, only to be unseated as leader by Ms Gillard three years later. He took his revenge on June 26th to make a comeback as prime minister. In spite of Labor's turmoils, Mr Rudd's return has changed the party's game. 
It has turned the election into a competitive race against the conservative Liberal-National coalition and Tony Abbott, its leader. An opinion poll on August 5th, the day after Mr Rudd announced the election, showed Labor trailing the opposition by just four points, once second-preference votes were counted; the last poll under Ms Gillard had Labor 14 points behind. Other polls since Mr Rudd's return suggests that the parties are neck-and-neck. 
Yet turning improvements in the polls into electoral victory will be hard. In the 150-seat House of Representatives, where government is decided, Labor holds 71 seats to 72 for the opposition parties. Two independents in New South Wales who supported Ms Gillard's minority government have stepped down, and the opposition seems likely to win both seats. Mr Rudd's salvation might lie in Mr Rudd's home state of Queensland. Voters there turned against Ms Gillard for her knifing of Mr Rudd. Peter Beattie, a former Queensland Labor state premier, reckons they will reward their favourite son's return with enough seats to offset losses elsewhere, delivering victory to Mr Rudd. Mr Beattie himself is coming out of retirement to contest an opposition-held seat. The political terrain is altered by the rise of small parties, such as the WikiLeaks Party, aiming to rob both Labor and the coalition of control of the Senate, the upper house. WikiLeaks's seven candidates include Julian Assange, standing for the Senate from the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he is holed up fighting extradition to Sweden. 
Labor's campaign also faces an enemy in the two-thirds of Australia's big-city newspapers that are controlled by News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's empire. Mr Murdoch made his stand plain in Sydney's Daily Telegraph, his most influential tabloid. Its first edition of the campaign covered the front page with the prime minister's picture and a call to readers to ""Kick This Mob Out"". Some say this fits Mr Murdoch's pattern of backing the candidate he thinks will win (the Telegraph supported Mr Rudd before his victory in 2007). The prime minister himself says the mogul's strategy is commercial. He told journalists in Brisbane that Mr Murdoch wanted ""his mate, Mr Abbott, in"" because a high-speed broadband network the government is building around Australia could ""challenge"" Foxtel, a cable-television company that News Corporation half-owns with Telstra, a telecoms giant. 
But if Mr Rudd has clawed back voters' support, it is partly by racing Mr Abbott to the bottom on issues that resonate in the tabloids' heartlands, notably getting tough with asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat. Mr Rudd's plan to resettle them in Papua New Guinea, Australia's nearest northern neighbour, seems to have gone down well in Sydney's sprawling, multi-ethnic western suburbs, where Labor faces losses. Nationally, voters like Mr Rudd more than Mr Abbott: an early campaign poll gave him a 14-point lead as preferred prime minister. 
The leaders are likely to slug out most of the campaign over which of them can do a better job on the economy. On August 2nd the Treasury revised its outlook for growth in 2013-14 to 2.5%, slightly lower than its forecast three months ago. It projected a A$33 billion ($29 billion) drop in forecast tax revenues over the next four years, partly because of falling commodity prices and a slowdown in China, Australia's biggest trading partner. That leaves little room for big spending promises. The election could boil down to a contest between ""trust"", as Mr Rudd puts it, or ""who is more fair dinkum"", in Mr Abbott's spin.","What promises to be a bruising election campaign gets under way

EXCEPTIONALLY among rich-world economies, Australia is now enjoying its 22nd year of uninterrupted growth. Much of the lucky country's recent prosperity came easily--from shipping coal and iron ore, Australia's two biggest exports, to China, its biggest market. But now that the Chinese boom is fading and commodity prices are slumping, that luck may be on the turn. 
This backdrop makes the election on September 7th critical. Australia needs a government that can take difficult decisions when forecasts of budget surpluses are turning into deficits, and a bit of inspired leadership to help it face a trickier future. The choice for voters, frankly, is not great. 
Daggy Abbott and rude Rudd 
Of the country's two main parties, the Liberal Party, now in opposition in a Liberal-National coalition, is the natural home of The Economist's vote: a centre-right party with a tradition of being pro-business and against big government. But the coalition's leader, Tony Abbott, does not seem an instinctive fan of markets, and one of the few key policies he has let on to possessing is a hugely expensive federal scheme for parental leave. That may help him persuade women voters that charges of misogyny are unfair, but he has not properly explained how he intends to pay for it . His social conservatism does not appeal to us: he opposes gay marriage and supports populist measures against Afghans, Sri Lankans, Vietnamese and others who have attempted to get from Indonesia into Australia in rickety craft that have drowned thousands in recent years. Indeed his promise to ""turn back the boats"" seems to be his only foreign policy. 
The argument for the protean Mr Abbott is that he might change yet again--and prove more pragmatic in office. He has certainly waged a disciplined campaign, helped by the strident support of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, and is ahead in the polls. But to switch to Mr Abbott requires a leap of faith. So how bad has the Labor Party been? 
The main mark against Labor's policy card is that it has shifted a long way towards Mr Abbott's position on asylum-seekers. Aside from that, it has a reasonable record. It has loosened its traditional ties to the trade unions and promoted growth and enterprise. It has managed the economy well while introducing popular social programmes, including an insurance scheme for disabled people, reforms to schools aimed at raising teaching standards and a high-speed fibre-optic network that is now being laid out across the vast country. It put a price on carbon emissions by introducing a carbon tax in July 2012. Given that Australia is both the world's biggest coal exporter and heavily reliant on coal for its electricity, this is a laudable achievement. Mr Abbott, once a climate-change denier, vows to scrap the tax (as well as cut spending on Labor's schools and broadband projects). 
The trouble with Labor is twofold. Its internecine strife makes the Chinese Communist Party look harmonious--warfare within its ranks has undermined Labor's governance during its six years in office--and there are questions over the character of its mercurial leader, Kevin Rudd. 
The two are connected. After leading Labor to a landslide victory in 2007, Mr Rudd was suddenly defenestrated by his deputy prime minister, Julia Gillard, in 2010. Though still popular among voters, he had forfeited the trust of his colleagues through his contemptuous treatment of them, his meddling and his indecisiveness. Ms Gillard's legislative record was better than Mr Rudd's (she introduced the carbon tax), but the party barons ousted her this year and reinstalled Mr Rudd, in the hope that he could work his old magic with voters. 
The choice between a man with a defective manifesto and one with a defective personality is not appealing--but Mr Rudd gets our vote, largely because of Labor's decent record. With deficits approaching, his numbers look more likely to add up than Mr Abbott's. Despite his high-handed style, Mr Rudd is a Blairite centrist. A strategic thinker about Asia, he has skills that will be useful, especially as Australia has to balance its economic dependence on China with its security dependence on America. It would be nice if he revived his liberal approach to asylum-seekers. And, who knows, he may even live up to his promise to be less vile to his colleagues.","Kevin Rudd just about deserves a second turn

TWO notable apologies came from the political leaders invited to the India Australia Friendship Fair on August 25th. Kevin Rudd, the Labor prime minister (pictured, above, left), was called to Canberra for a briefing on Syria so could not attend. Tony Abbott, the opposition leader (above, right), flew to Brisbane to launch his campaign for Australia's general election on September 7th. Opinion polls suggest Mr Abbott and his Liberal-National coalition will end six years of Labor rule. 
The two federal leaders missed a colourful day of Bollywood music, Indian food and speeches from across Australia's political divide. Anglo-Celtic politicians who did show up mingled with a 15,000-strong crowd of Indians, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese and Chinese. Understanding the jamboree's importance, Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott each sent along their minister and shadow minister for immigration. 
The fair happened in Homebush, a suburb in the heart of western Sydney. Australia's biggest city is a chief battleground for the election. Its sprawling western suburbs, home to almost half of metropolitan Sydney's 4.7m people, will see some of the closest contests. Over the past three decades immigration has transformed what were once white, working-class Labor heartlands into modern Australia's new frontier. Some 27% of Australians were born overseas. In some parts of western Sydney, the proportion is more than half. 
Parramatta, one of the oldest suburbs, has drawn many settlers from India, now Australia's biggest source of immigrants. Cabramatta, about 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) to the south-west, is home to thousands of boat people and their descendants who fled Indochina after the Vietnam war. Political allegiances have swung unpredictably. Chris Hayes, who holds the constituency around Cabramatta for Labor, predicts a lot more volatility in how the west votes this time. 
It was partly in the hope of containing that volatility that Labor Party barons dismissed Julia Gillard in June as leader and prime minister and reinstalled Mr Rudd. Under the less popular Ms Gillard, Labor faced big losses in Sydney and other parts of New South Wales, the most populous state. At first the gamble seemed to work, with some opinion polls showing Labor neck-and-neck with the opposition. But they now point to a coalition win. Mr Rudd has had trouble selling to voters the government's strongest story: its success in keeping the economy growing through the global financial crisis and holding unemployment down to 5.7%. Instead, voters are put off more by Labor's turmoils since it came to power in 2007: two leadership changes, from Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard and back again, and bitter personal rivalry between the pair. An opinion poll the day before the Homebush fair suggested several Labor-held seats in western Sydney could fall. Labor will also struggle in Queensland, Mr Rudd's home state; he may even battle to hold his own seat in suburban Brisbane. A senior Labor parliamentarian at the fair thought that ""people have stopped listening to Kevin"". 
Mr Abbott has played ruthlessly on Labor's troubles. He asks Australians if they can ""afford another three years like the last six"". A junkyard dog by his own admission, Mr Abbott once had a reputation for gaffes. He has run a disciplined campaign on this occasion, however. The big question is over his sprawling spending plans, which put him at odds with the Liberal Party's pro-market, small-government stance. He has failed to explain convincingly how he would fund them, especially after the Treasury recently cut forecasts of government revenues over the next four years by A$33 billion ($29 billion). 
If he wins, Mr Abbott promises that his first act will be to abolish Labor's carbon tax, introduced last year. In place of a market means of fighting climate change, he offers ""direct action"": spending more than A$3 billion over four years on inducements for big carbon-emitters to clean up their acts. Critics argue that such a scheme would be open to abuse. 
But Mr Abbott's most controversial policy involves the federal government giving maternity leave to women earning up to A$150,000 a year at full salary for six months. He plans to cover half the cost with a 1.5 percentage-point rise in the corporate tax rate on high-earning companies. Mr Abbott hatched the maternity-leave idea as a bid to improve his poor standing among women voters. Several prospective ministerial colleagues disapprove of it, and economists have slammed it. Saul Eslake, of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Australia, calls it a ""dreadful policy"" that would not bear out Mr Abbott's claim that it would raise productivity. Mr Eslake says Mr Abbott's ""dubious view of markets"" and ""greater enthusiasm for government intervention"" could dull any business and investor confidence that might follow a coalition win. 
Mr Rudd started his campaign's last stages on August 27th with a speech on foreign policy, a field in which Mr Abbott has shown minimal interest. Hugh White, a thinker on foreign policy, reckons Mr Rudd's ideas on Australia's international standing are ""incomparably better informed"" than either Ms Gillard's or Mr Abbott's. But they are less likely to swing votes in regions such as western Sydney than the strong anti-Rudd campaign from the two-thirds of Australia's big-city newspapers run by News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's vehicle. National polls still show that Australians would prefer Mr Rudd to Mr Abbott as prime minister, but they are fed up with Labor.

WHAT an economist, Ross Garnaut, has called ""the Australian great complacency"" may be coming to an end. Since 1990-91, Mr Garnaut has pointed out, Australians ""have enjoyed the longest period of economic expansion unbroken by recession of any developed country ever."" In recent years that boom has been sustained by the relatively simple business of digging Australia up and selling it to China. The campaign for the general election on September 7th was fought against the backdrop of a Chinese economy growing more slowly, and a sense that, with Australian luck running out, the country needs new ideas. 
In ending six years of Labor Party rule and electing the conservative Liberal-National coalition--and hence Tony Abbott as prime minister--voters certainly plumped for change. In part, Labor can blame the tiresome, self-destructive infighting that characterised its rule. The prime minister elected in 2007, Kevin Rudd, was toppled in a party coup three years later, only to scheme his way back into the job just ahead of this election. But the vote also marks a distinct shift to the right in Australian politics: on economic and social policy, and on climate change. 
Mr Abbott said the election was a referendum on the tax that the Labor government imposed on carbon emissions and which he wants to abolish. If so, voters spoke decisively. The coalition looks likely to have a majority of at least 30 in the 150-seat lower house of Parliament. But a problem for Mr Abbott looms in the Senate, where only 40 of the 76 seats were contested at this election. A fiendishly complicated voting system appears to have handed the balance of power to perhaps eight independents and minor parties. They include the Palmer United Party of Clive Palmer, a mining billionaire from Queensland, which may have two Senate seats. One of his possible senators-elect has indicated she may not vote to scrap the carbon tax. Other likely winners include the Australian Sports Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party (core values: minimal government, freedom of assembly and ""mateship""). Their voting plans are unpredictable. 
From his earlier days as a student politician in the 1970s, Mr Abbott emerged as one of Australia's roughest political brawlers. He was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, where he boxed for the university, and later spent a brief stint in a Catholic seminary and also worked as a journalist before entering Parliament 19 years ago. The press used to call him the ""mad monk"" for his aggressive style and gaffes. But in late 2009, with behind-the-scenes support from John Howard, the Liberal prime minister from 1996 to 2007, an influential figure who is both Mr Abbott's biggest champion and hero, Mr Abbott won the Liberal leadership, by a single vote. 
He is a social conservative in Mr Howard's mould, opposing gay marriage for example. But though he casts himself in the Thatcher and Reagan tradition, Mr Abbott is less predictable when it comes to the pro-market stance of the Liberal Party. Some detect in his religious background a suspicion of big business, and approval of government intervention. His plan for an expensive federal scheme for parental leave, for example, is not the stuff of small-government conservatism, his party's usual fare. 
Foreign affairs barely featured in the campaign, perhaps reflecting a bipartisan consensus on most big issues. But Mr Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking former diplomat, mocked Mr Abbott's foreign-policy credentials, suggesting his analysis of the war in Syria (""baddies v baddies"") belonged to the ""John Wayne school of international relations"". Mr Abbott probably did not mind too much. Often photographed in Lycra, he plays up his image as a kind of Australian superbloke, whose natural habitat is the beach (he is a volunteer lifeguard), barbecue (firefighter, too) or gym. 
The coalition spelled out only two clear foreign policies: a controversial plan to use the navy to turn back asylum-seeker boats at sea; and a $4.5 billion ($4.2 billion) cut over four years in the budget for foreign aid. For the rest, the coalition's policy was summarised as ""more Jakarta; less Geneva"". The slogan acknowledges that Australia's destiny is now bound up with its immediate Asian neighbourhood, which accounts for more than two-thirds of its trade; and that the new prime minister gets this. 
Mr Abbott has had to distance himself from his loyalty to the ""Anglosphere"". In his 2009 memoir, ""Battlelines"", Mr Abbott wrote of his support for Australia's alliance with America and its ties with Britain and its monarchy. But now, says Julie Bishop, who will be his foreign minister, his policy will focus ""not exclusively but unambiguously"" on the Indo-Pacific. His first foreign trip will be to Indonesia. It might be sticky. Indonesia, a staging post for most of Australia's boat-people, is not impressed with Mr Abbott's plans to push them back there. 
Even more important is how to handle China, Australia's biggest market. Mr Rudd, far from being admired for his mastery of the language, was reviled in Beijing almost as much as in his own parliamentary party. In contrast, Mr Howard managed to improve ties with both America, sending troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, and with China. Mr Abbott hopes to do the same. 
Surprise, surprise 
Since Mr Howard's day, however, China has grown more assertive, while America, with its trumpeting of a strategic ""pivot"" to Asia, has pushed back. One aspect of that is the agreement in 2011 to rotate 2,500 marines through Australia's Northern Territory. Ms Bishop argues that China's anger at this deployment was a result of not having been consulted; Mr Abbott will avoid such pitfalls with a ""no surprises"" approach. But more than diplomatic courtesy will be needed as military rivalry between a rising China and the incumbent superpower intensifies. In ""Battlelines"" Mr Abbott argued that China's growing strength ""may not mean much change for Australia's international relationships or foreign-policy priorities."" So far, that has been true enough. But it may yet turn out to be another facet of the great complacency.","Tony Abbott 's remarkable progression from junkyard dog to Kevin Rudd 
 WHAT an economist , Ross Garnaut , has called "" the Australian great complacency "" may be coming to an end . Since 1990 - 91 , Mr Garnaut has pointed out , Australians "" have enjoyed the longest period of economic expansion unbroken by recession of any developed country ever . "" In recent years that boom has been sustained by the relatively simple business of digging Australia up and selling it to China . The campaign for the general election on September 7th was fought against the backdrop of a Chinese economy growing more slowly , and a sense that , with Australian luck running out , the country needs new ideas . 
 In ending six years of Labor Party rule and electing the conservative Liberal - National coalition -- and hence Tony Abbott as Kevin Rudd -- voters certainly plumped for change . In part , Labor can blame the tiresome , self - destructive infighting that characterised its rule . The prime minister elected in 2007 , Kevin Rudd , was toppled in a party coup three years later , only to scheme his way back into the job just ahead of this election . But the vote also marks a distinct shift to the right in Australian politics : on economic and social policy , and on climate change . 
 Mr Abbott said the election was a referendum on the tax that the Labor government imposed on carbon emissions and which he wants to abolish . If so , voters spoke decisively . The coalition looks likely to have a majority of at least 30 in the 150 - seat lower house of Parliament . But a problem for Mr Abbott looms in the Senate , where only 40 of the 76 seats were contested at this election . A fiendishly complicated voting system appears to have handed the balance of power to perhaps eight independents and minor parties . They include the Palmer United Party of Clive Palmer , a mining billionaire from Queensland , which may have two Senate seats . One of his possible senators - elect has indicated she may not vote to scrap the carbon tax . Other likely winners include the Australian Sports Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party ( core values : minimal government , freedom of assembly and "" mateship "" ) . Their voting plans are unpredictable . 
 From his earlier days as a student politician in the 1970s , Mr Abbott emerged as one of Australia 's roughest political brawlers . He was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford , where he boxed for the university , and later spent a brief stint in a Catholic seminary and also worked as a journalist before entering Parliament 19 years ago . The press used to call him the "" mad monk "" for his aggressive style and gaffes . But in late 2009 , with behind - the - scenes support from John Howard , the Liberal prime minister from 1996 to 2007 , an influential figure who is both Mr Abbott 's biggest champion and hero , Mr Abbott won the Liberal leadership , by a single vote . 
 He is a social conservative in Mr Howard 's mould , opposing gay marriage for example . But though he casts himself in the Thatcher and Reagan tradition , Mr Abbott is less predictable when it comes to the pro - market stance of the Liberal Party . Some detect in his religious background a suspicion of big business , and approval of government intervention . His plan for an expensive federal scheme for parental leave , for example , is not the stuff of small - government conservatism , his party 's usual fare . 
 Foreign affairs barely featured in the campaign , perhaps reflecting a bipartisan consensus on most big issues . But Mr Rudd , a Mandarin - speaking former diplomat , mocked Mr Abbott 's foreign - policy credentials , suggesting his analysis of the war in Syria ( "" baddies v baddies "" ) belonged to the "" John Wayne school of international relations "" .

FIVE weeks after it lost power to a conservative coalition under Tony Abbott, Australia's Labor Party has installed a new leader. Bill Shorten, 46, prevailed in a leadership contest that was, for the first time, thrown open to a vote by all party members. After six turbulent years in government under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, Mr Shorten must now reunite the party. 
It was Mr Rudd who pushed through the new rules. In the past, Labor parliamentarians had decided the leadership. Mr Rudd proposed giving equal weight to votes from ordinary party members, arguing that a Labor leader who wins an election should stay for a full term. 
Mr Shorten, from the party's right in Melbourne, defeated Anthony Albanese, a left-wing figure from Sydney, in the leadership contest. Trained as a lawyer, Mr Shorten is a former head of the Australian Workers' Union, one of the country's most powerful. He entered federal parliament only in 2007, but has already been a minister for workplace relations, education and financial services. 
Although keen to project himself as a new face, offering ""big ideas"" for a ""diverse nation"", Mr Shorten is still seen by some as part of Labor's old faction-ridden ways. He helped to engineer a coup against Mr Rudd in 2010 that installed Ms Gillard as leader. When she looked likely to lead Labor to defeat this year, Mr Shorten helped to reinstate Mr Rudd. Some rancour still lingers. Nicola Roxon, a former Rudd and Gillard minister, accepts Mr Rudd's ousting was ""an act of political bastardry"". But she says it only happened ""because Kevin had been such a bastard himself"". 
Mr Shorten's first test as opposition leader will come when Parliament resumes in November. Mr Abbott has pledged legislation to abolish the former Labor government's carbon tax. Mr Shorten supports carbon pricing.

WHEN he made Jakarta his first foreign destination after he was elected as Australia's prime minister in September, Tony Abbott promised a relationship with Indonesia ""of no surprises, based on mutual trust"". Only two months later, Indonesia has decided to downgrade its relationship with Mr Abbott's government. The country has been enraged by revelations by Guardian Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that in 2009 Australia's Defence Signals Directorate (DSD), an intelligence agency, tried to tap the phones of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Indonesia's president, his wife and several in his innermost circle. 
Australia has survived crises with its closest northern neighbour before, especially over their disagreements over East Timor (now Timor-Leste) and Indonesia's policies in West Papua. This one may be more damaging than any. Indonesia's leaders seem livid. 
Mr Yudhoyono took to Twitter this week to lodge a ""strong protest"" at the ""hurtful action"" by Australia. (He had already ordered the return of Indonesia's ambassador from Canberra.) He complained that the Australian prime minister had ""belittled"" the matter, making a statement on it that carried no remorse. An Indonesian minister has cancelled a planned trip to Australia. 
Indonesia's ambassador to America, Dino Patti Djalal, was a presidential spokesman in 2009 when his phone was one of those allegedly tapped. He says Indonesians are realistic enough to know that bugging is commonplace, ""but we also believe that, between 'strategic partners', some things should be off-limits."" Mr Djalal warns Australia ""not to underestimate the sense of anger felt by Indonesian leaders and common people"". 
Mr Abbott, who during his election campaign had promised ""More Jakarta, less Geneva"", has put Indonesia at the centre of his foreign policy in a way no other Australian leader has. ""Stop the boats"", his other foreign-policy pledge, meant stemming the flow of asylum-seekers arriving in Australia, many of whom stop off in Indonesia and embark from there. 
Indonesia has long been a target of Australia's snooping as part of an intelligence-sharing club known as ""Five Eyes"", whose other members are America, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The revelations of Australia's 2009 phone-bugging appear to have come from secret documents leaked by the former American National Security Agency contractor, Edward Snowden. The documents listed ""leadership targets"" and their types of mobile phones. Experts believe it is a safe assumption that this was not the only month in which Australia's intelligence agencies dabbled in Indonesian ""leadership communications"". 
Mr Abbott could argue that this bugging, at least, happened under Kevin Rudd's former Labor government. But he chose not to, and Labor, now in opposition, rallied to his support. Mr Abbott's response to the furore has hardly been conciliatory. He has offered ""regret"" for any embarrassment that Mr Yudhoyono suffered from the reports. But he insisted that ""Australia should not be expected to apologise for the steps we take to protect our country now or in the past."" 
That mirrors the language Mr Abbott used in his election campaign to promote his policy of turning back asylum-seekers' boats to Indonesia. This policy in itself angered the Indonesian government, especially Mr Abbott's plan for Australia to buy boats from fishermen believed likely to rent or sell them to people-smugglers. The main achievement of his recent visit to Jakarta was to secure Indonesia's agreement to talk about this. It is one of the areas of co-operation Indonesia has now cancelled. 
Mr Abbott sees Indonesia as the ""most important single relationship that we have"". But his clumsiness may have put that at risk. Hugh White at the Australian National University reckons that the row will only strengthen the impression in Indonesia that when the prime minister offered ""respect for Indonesia's sovereignty"" during his Jakarta visit, it was ""not so much deft diplomacy as insincerity"".

IN THE the heart of old Shanghai is a magnificent villa that serves as the workplace of Guo Jingming, a provocative young film-maker. ""Tiny Times"", his recent blockbuster, follows the travails of some fashionable college girls (pictured, in the walk-in closet of one of them). Its depictions of the high life, rarely shown in Chinese films, have set social networks ablaze; they have also been attacked by the People's Daily for ""unconditional hedonism"". Mr Guo says: ""So what? Materialism is neutral, neither positive nor negative."" After all, he goes on, China's cosmopolitans know at any given moment what movies are playing in New York and what fashions are on the Paris runways. 
China's once-drab and Mao-suited interior is not so far behind. In Mianyang, a middling city in the province of Sichuan, an enormous billboard featuring Miranda Kerr, an Australian supermodel, draped in Swarovski crystals welcomes shoppers to the Parkson shopping mall. It is one of half a dozen high-end malls in town. Luxury sales are exploding there. Local Audi and BMW dealers sell more than 100 cars each a month; Land Rover, Jaguar and Cadillac have just muscled in on the market. 
Thirty kilometres (20 miles) away in Luxi, a town of 57,000 people, online shopping is hot. The first express-delivery office opened only three years ago, and handled perhaps ten packages a day; today, there are five, each handling 100 packages a day. Even 60km away, in rural Santai county where farm-workers are the customers, one modern shopping mall has sprung up and another is being built. ""Customers are evolving very quickly from the low-end market to the middle and high-end,"" says Yang Shuiying, proud general manager of the Zizhou shopping centre. 
In the 1950s and 1960s the world economy was transformed by the emergence of the American consumer. Now China seems poised to become the next consumption superpower. In all likelihood, it has just overtaken Japan to become the world's second-biggest consumer economy. Its roughly $3.3 trillion in private consumption is about 8% of the world total, and it has only just begun. 
""The future of the world will be profoundly shaped by China's rush toward consumerism,"" says Karl Gerth, an expert on Chinese consumption at the University of California, San Diego. Although investment made the biggest contribution to China's growth last year, and although private consumption's share of output, now at 36%, fell between 2000 and 2010, that trend is unlikely to last, for several reasons. 
First, boosting the people's desire to consume is a stated goal of China's leaders. Higher government spending on health care and pensions may encourage households to save less for such things. Higher interest rates may, paradoxically, discourage thrift if people reach their savings goals faster. Rising wages and an ageing population will also shift the balance towards consumption rather than saving. And although household debt is growing fast, China still has relatively little. 
Besides, consumption has not fallen in absolute terms. It has, in fact, grown briskly--just not quite as quickly as the economy overall. In dollar terms, China contributed more than any other country to the growth in global consumption in 2011-13, according to Andy Rothman of CLSA, a broker. Moreover, China's official statistics understate some consumption--spending on housing, for example. 
A massive push to urbanise is also under way, which should produce tens of millions of richer citizens seeking retail therapy. McKinsey, a consultancy, forecasts that consumption by urban Chinese households will increase from 10 trillion yuan in 2012 to nearly 27 trillion yuan in 2022 (see chart 1). 
Fickle sophisticates 
How much China spends is striking. Even more so is the way it spends. This is now one of the world's most sophisticated consumer markets, heavily skewed towards expensive goods. Local property barons are now building half the world's new shopping malls in China, many of them in smaller cities, because even punters without big incomes are becoming big shoppers. Research by IDEO, a consultancy, has found that many young migrant workers earning less than 5,000 yuan ($830) a month will spend a month's wages on an Apple iPhone. 
That points to another difference from previous consumption booms elsewhere: with the world's largest e-commerce market at their fingertips, Chinese shoppers are online from the start. As a result, what was once a foreign marketers' fantasyland is now the world's fiercest battleground for brands. 
Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, calls the Chinese ""increasingly aspirational and conspicuous consumers"" who routinely trade up to fancier labels even on staples. Newly middle-class types in cities in the interior are keen to try out new products, especially the ones they have seen on foreign television shows. Jeff Walters of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) points out that even country bumpkins are consuming global media, thanks to the wild popularity of local online-video services. Chinese consumers, he says, were watching the latest season of ""Downton Abbey"" on Youku, a video-sharing website, well before it was released in America. 
This passion for fashion is, in theory, good news for multinational marketers. Unlike, say, Japan, where consumers heavily favour local brands, Chinese consumers hold foreign brands in high esteem. Torsten Stocker of AT Kearney, a consultancy, observes that foreign brands are doing well in sectors they introduced to China (chewing gum, chocolate); those that have ""heritage"" appeal (premium cars, luxury goods) and those where local brands are not trusted, such as powdered baby milk. The world's fast-food and consumer-goods giants--Procter & Gamble, Pepsi, General Mills and so on--are also big in China, but they are increasingly dogged by local rivals. A recent study by Bain, another consultancy, found that although foreign brands still lead in some areas (biscuits, fabric-softener, bottled water), local brands are surging in others (toothpaste, cosmetics, juice). 
Brand-hopping, though, is rife. Having grown up with radical economic change, Chinese shoppers are ""very fickle, and hard to pin down to a strong brand loyalty"", says Mintel, a market-research firm. Yuval Atsmon of McKinsey reckons that brand-switching--between Pepsi and Coke, Colgate and Crest, KFC and McDonald's--is common, ""much more so than in most markets"". Swarovski, the crystal-maker, has discovered that over three-quarters of Chinese customers are eager to try new brands, a far higher figure than elsewhere. A recent study by Bain found that the top five brands in ten categories lost 30-60% of their customers between 2011 and 2012. 
This creates several problems. With two or three times as many brands on shelves as found in other countries, competition is ferocious. This makes advertising and marketing vital--but the cost of publicity is soaring. Also, firms that thought they enjoyed a ""first-mover advantage"" have discovered that their brands are now seen as stodgy or old-fashioned. Olay, a cosmetics brand, defined skin care in China for a generation--but Carol Potter of BBDO, an advertising agency, reckons that ""the new generation thinks it's a brand from yesterday."" She adds that whereas Louis Vuitton once symbolised good and expensive taste in China, a new generation is seeking different, subtler luxuries. 
The empty suitcase 
Another complication for marketers is that many Chinese shoppers have a global outlook. When previous middle classes rose to prominence in America and Japan, the internet did not exist. People could not Google the latest European fashions or check discounts on Amazon. The arrival of cheap air travel has also made the Chinese more discerning shoppers. Mr Stocker argues that these factors have ""compressed the discovery process"", which in Japan took 30 years, to less than ten. 
The Chinese are already the world's biggest shoppers abroad, but a report released on January 20th by CLSA forecasts that the number of outbound Chinese tourists will double to 200m a year by 2020 and that their spending will triple over that time. James Button of SmithStreet, a consultancy, reports a well established piece of etiquette: ""You must let friends know when you are going overseas,"" and take along an empty suitcase. 
Many Chinese also use online shopping agents, who aggregate requests and bring back foreign goods. Sales by overseas purchase agents came to nearly 50 billion yuan in 2012, a leap of more than 80% on the year earlier; they jumped by half again last year to 74.4. billion yuan. Foreign websites, including Amazon, now offer direct delivery to China for certain products, and local e-commerce giants such as Alibaba run cross-border services. 
Buying overseas saves money, since mark-ups and hefty taxes are the rule in China. Many ordinary folk travel not just to Hong Kong, the most convenient spot, but to Jeju Island in South Korea (where they can visit without a visa and shop duty-free) to stock up on cosmetics that cost much more at home. Price, though, is not the only motivation. Another is to avoid the counterfeit goods so common on the mainland. Even more important, consumers say, are the variety and freshness of the products available overseas. 
Nowhere is this wide-ranging urge to spend more obvious than in the market for luxury goods. Globally the Chinese are the biggest buyers of expensive items, accounting for some 29% of purchases last year (see chart 2). Some two-thirds of Chinese spending on luxury goods takes place outside the mainland; a fifth of it in Europe. (Harrods of London has seen sales to Chinese shoppers, its largest foreign contingent, increase by 50% a year since 2011.) Consistently favoured brands include Lancome, Gucci, Audi, Rolex and Tiffany. 
The Chinese are also the world's largest consumers of Bordeaux wine and cognac, though sales (like those of Moutai, a local grain alcohol) have fallen in the wake of official campaigns against gift-giving ( 
). At Berry Bros & Rudd's bonded wine warehouse in Basingstoke, in southern England, where 4.5m expensive bottles are stored, more than 1m of those are owned by oenophiles from greater China. No longer, says the firm's chairman, should the Chinese be pictured ruining fine wine by pouring Coca-Cola into it. 
Although a government crackdown on corruption has crimped mainland sales, and some luxury firms slowed down the rollout of new boutiques there last year, Coach, Prada and Bottega Veneta continued to expand. Apple expanded too; it now has more stores in Shanghai than in San Francisco, and launches new iPhones in Beijing when it does in California. Mr Button of SmithStreet thinks brands offering affordable luxury--Michael Kors and Kate Spade, say--can capture both the upwardly mobile and the ""post-luxury"" elites in the cities, who want less flashy brands. 
In the past, the Chinese showed little interest in Western art. That is starting to change, and may change quicker with the opening of a new museum of Western art in Shanghai. The richest man in China has just paid $28m for a Picasso, though he was condemned as ""unpatriotic"" on Sina Weibo. Ms Potter also observes that two-thirds of affluent consumers are keen to know the history and cultural background of foreign brands. So they love to buy Piaget watches in Geneva and Zegna suits in Milan, but reject unconventional offerings such as German watches or Japanese leather bags. 
It is not only in luxury goods that Chinese shoppers are leading the way. China has become the world's biggest e-commerce market, with spending forecast to reach $540 billion next year. On Singles Day, an annual online-marketing extravaganza held on November 11th, 400m Chinese spent $5.7 billion just on Tmall, an e-commerce platform run by Alibaba; Americans, on their Cyber Monday a few weeks later, spent only about $2 billion. China is the world's biggest maker and consumer of smartphones, and will soon be the largest ""mobile-commerce"" market, too. 
Perhaps because they distrust official information, the Chinese rely heavily on peer reviews. Research by BCG has shown that they write, and act on, online reviews of products and services far more than Westerners do. A recent study of purchases of moisturiser found that two-thirds of Chinese buyers relied on online recommendations by friends or family; the comparable figure in America was less than 40%. Millions of online shoppers follow the thoughts of Miumiu and Viviandan, leggy twins from industrial Chongqing, who started posting pictures of themselves in the latest fashions, with wry observations on trends and prices, a decade ago. Even now they post recommendations nearly every day on social-media sites such as Instagram, or on Weibo. Their likes and dislikes make or break products. 
Online shoppers in the remotest parts of China often know a great deal about a global brand's attributes and pricing worldwide--which can put marketers on the back foot. Chinese consumers are no longer willing to pay a hefty premium for any old foreign brand. As they grow more discerning, multinationals are having to work harder to prove their worth--and are having to defend their brands on China's wild social media. But creative approaches can pay off. 
When VF Corporation, a large American clothing firm, wanted to promote The North Face, a brand of outdoor clothing, in China, it struggled. Whereas climbers and hikers in the West relish the thought of conquering mountains alone, the Chinese generally think of outings in Nature as a spiritual escape, to be enjoyed with friends. So the firm created an online community linking amateurs to clubs devoted to outdoor pursuits. The website offers points for activity and loyalty that can be redeemed for products. Sales are soaring, and VF now has a detailed database of over half a million keen customers. 
The online awareness of Chinese customers has big global implications. According to Andrew Keith, the president of Lane Crawford, cosmopolitan Chinese consumers are now setting the agenda: ""We are not teaching them, they are teaching us."" (He should know; his Hong Kong department store has half a dozen shops in greater China, 650,000 high-spending customers and, in the new Shanghai store, private suites for ""Platinum VIPs"" who spend 60,000 yuan or more a year.) Alexis Perakis-Valat, head of L'Oreal's China business, agrees. He believes that the Chinese market, unlike those in Western countries, is driven by young urban consumers who are demanding something new and have no taboos. He points to peculiar and distinctive products developed for this niche in China, such as a black-foam face-scrub for men, which are now being launched around the world. 
We're all Chinese now 
Another sign of such innovation is the reinvention of Johnnie Walker, a mass-market whisky brand belonging to Diageo, the world's biggest spirits firm, as a luxury brand in China. Keen to win over sceptical consumers more accustomed to baijiu (a local firewater), the firm opened Johnnie Walker House in Shanghai almost three years ago. For around 800,000 yuan, or $132,000, the company's master blender (with the delicious surname of Beveridge) will fly in and brew a special batch of Johnnie Walker precisely matched to a customer's tastes. Certain rare blends, including some bearing the marks of the Chinese zodiac, are sold only at this venue. 
This effort has helped Diageo introduce its whiskies to thousands of affluent customers, who in turn have pushed the firm towards new inventions--such as blends with a much higher alcohol content--which helped its whisky revenues grow twice as fast as the industry average. The concept has been such a success that the company has opened new Houses in Beijing and Seoul, and plans others. When Diageo unveiled Odyssey, a special-edition blend, in 2012, it kicked off the global launch not in London or New York but in Shanghai. 
Life was simpler for foreign brands when they first came to China, reflects David Roth of The Store, an advertising agency: ""It was a land grab...you just had to create awareness as quickly as possible."" Now the Western invaders must not only cater to the world's most demanding shoppers, but also cope with increasing home-grown competition. Chinese firms are starting to catch up with their fancier foreign rivals. Some even aspire to become global brands. 
Huawei, a telecoms-equipment giant, is making a big push into branded consumer electronics. ""We have it easier than Samsung did,"" says Colin Giles, chief marketing officer for its consumer business, because Korean firms paved the way for global acceptance of Chinese brands. Xiaomi, a startup smartphone manufacturer in Beijing, has developed a hugely popular phone-and-app system inspired as much by Amazon as by Apple. It could become China's first global innovation powerhouse. 
Leading the local pack is Lenovo, an electronics firm that previously bought IBM's personal-computer business (and on January 23rd agreed to buy its low-end server business, too). When it launched its latest Yoga tablet last year it chose Ashton Kutcher, a Hollywood star who had played Steve Jobs in a film, as its spokesman. David Roman, Lenovo's chief marketing officer, says that even a few years ago it would have been unthinkable to do a global product launch in China with a single tagline, unified advertising content and a Western spokesman. But now he thinks there is ""a global consuming class"", with more in common across borders than within. 
That sums up the rise of China nicely. Future consumer markets everywhere are going to look more Chinese. They will increasingly be cosmopolitan, luxury-minded and online. Firms that can flourish in China are not only winning today's toughest market, but are also positioning themselves for tomorrow's.

IN THE the heart of old Shanghai is a magnificent villa that serves as the workplace of Guo Jingming, a provocative young film-maker. ""Tiny Times"", his recent blockbuster, follows the travails of some fashionable college girls (pictured, in the walk-in closet of one of them). Its depictions of the high life, rarely shown in Chinese films, have set social networks ablaze; they have also been attacked by the People's Daily for ""unconditional hedonism"". Mr Guo says: ""So what? Materialism is neutral, neither positive nor negative."" After all, he goes on, China's cosmopolitans know at any given moment what movies are playing in New York and what fashions are on the Paris runways. 
China's once-drab and Mao-suited interior is not so far behind. In Mianyang, a middling city in the province of Sichuan, an enormous billboard featuring Miranda Kerr, an Australian supermodel, draped in Swarovski crystals welcomes shoppers to the Parkson shopping mall. It is one of half a dozen high-end malls in town. Luxury sales are exploding there. Local Audi and BMW dealers sell more than 100 cars each a month; Land Rover, Jaguar and Cadillac have just muscled in on the market. 
Thirty kilometres (20 miles) away in Luxi, a town of 57,000 people, online shopping is hot. The first express-delivery office opened only three years ago, and handled perhaps ten packages a day; today, there are five, each handling 100 packages a day. Even 60km away, in rural Santai county where farm-workers are the customers, one modern shopping mall has sprung up and another is being built. ""Customers are evolving very quickly from the low-end market to the middle and high-end,"" says Yang Shuiying, proud general manager of the Zizhou shopping centre. 
In the 1950s and 1960s the world economy was transformed by the emergence of the American consumer. Now China seems poised to become the next consumption superpower. In all likelihood, it has just overtaken Japan to become the world's second-biggest consumer economy. Its roughly $3.3 trillion in private consumption is about 8% of the world total, and it has only just begun. 
""The future of the world will be profoundly shaped by China's rush toward consumerism,"" says Karl Gerth, an expert on Chinese consumption at the University of California, San Diego. Although investment made the biggest contribution to China's growth last year, and although private consumption's share of output, now at 36%, fell between 2000 and 2010, that trend is unlikely to last, for several reasons. 
First, boosting the people's desire to consume is a stated goal of China's leaders. Higher government spending on health care and pensions may encourage households to save less for such things. Higher interest rates may, paradoxically, discourage thrift if people reach their savings goals faster. Rising wages and an ageing population will also shift the balance towards consumption rather than saving. And although household debt is growing fast, China still has relatively little. 
Besides, consumption has not fallen in absolute terms. It has, in fact, grown briskly--just not quite as quickly as the economy overall. In dollar terms, China contributed more than any other country to the growth in global consumption in 2011-13, according to Andy Rothman of CLSA, a broker. Moreover, China's official statistics understate some consumption--spending on housing, for example. 
A massive push to urbanise is also under way, which should produce tens of millions of richer citizens seeking retail therapy. McKinsey, a consultancy, forecasts that consumption by urban Chinese households will increase from 10 trillion yuan in 2012 to nearly 27 trillion yuan in 2022 (see chart 1). 
Fickle sophisticates 
How much China spends is striking. Even more so is the way it spends. This is now one of the world's most sophisticated consumer markets, heavily skewed towards expensive goods. Local property barons are now building half the world's new shopping malls in China, many of them in smaller cities, because even punters without big incomes are becoming big shoppers. Research by IDEO, a consultancy, has found that many young migrant workers earning less than 5,000 yuan ($830) a month will spend a month's wages on an Apple iPhone. 
That points to another difference from previous consumption booms elsewhere: with the world's largest e-commerce market at their fingertips, Chinese shoppers are online from the start. As a result, what was once a foreign marketers' fantasyland is now the world's fiercest battleground for brands. 
Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, calls the Chinese ""increasingly aspirational and conspicuous consumers"" who routinely trade up to fancier labels even on staples. Newly middle-class types in cities in the interior are keen to try out new products, especially the ones they have seen on foreign television shows. Jeff Walters of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) points out that even country bumpkins are consuming global media, thanks to the wild popularity of local online-video services. Chinese consumers, he says, were watching the latest season of ""Downton Abbey"" on Youku, a video-sharing website, well before it was released in America. 
This passion for fashion is, in theory, good news for multinational marketers. Unlike, say, Japan, where consumers heavily favour local brands, Chinese consumers hold foreign brands in high esteem. Torsten Stocker of AT Kearney, a consultancy, observes that foreign brands are doing well in sectors they introduced to China (chewing gum, chocolate); those that have ""heritage"" appeal (premium cars, luxury goods) and those where local brands are not trusted, such as powdered baby milk. The world's fast-food and consumer-goods giants--Procter & Gamble, Pepsi, General Mills and so on--are also big in China, but they are increasingly dogged by local rivals. A recent study by Bain, another consultancy, found that although foreign brands still lead in some areas (biscuits, fabric-softener, bottled water), local brands are surging in others (toothpaste, cosmetics, juice). 
Brand-hopping, though, is rife. Having grown up with radical economic change, Chinese shoppers are ""very fickle, and hard to pin down to a strong brand loyalty"", says Mintel, a market-research firm. Yuval Atsmon of McKinsey reckons that brand-switching--between Pepsi and Coke, Colgate and Crest, KFC and McDonald's--is common, ""much more so than in most markets"". Swarovski, the crystal-maker, has discovered that over three-quarters of Chinese customers are eager to try new brands, a far higher figure than elsewhere. A recent study by Bain found that the top five brands in ten categories lost 30-60% of their customers between 2011 and 2012. 
This creates several problems. With two or three times as many brands on shelves as found in other countries, competition is ferocious. This makes advertising and marketing vital--but the cost of publicity is soaring. Also, firms that thought they enjoyed a ""first-mover advantage"" have discovered that their brands are now seen as stodgy or old-fashioned. Olay, a cosmetics brand, defined skin care in China for a generation--but Carol Potter of BBDO, an advertising agency, reckons that ""the new generation thinks it's a brand from yesterday."" She adds that whereas Louis Vuitton once symbolised good and expensive taste in China, a new generation is seeking different, subtler luxuries. 
The empty suitcase 
Another complication for marketers is that many Chinese shoppers have a global outlook. When previous middle classes rose to prominence in America and Japan, the internet did not exist. People could not Google the latest European fashions or check discounts on Amazon. The arrival of cheap air travel has also made the Chinese more discerning shoppers. Mr Stocker argues that these factors have ""compressed the discovery process"", which in Japan took 30 years, to less than ten. 
The Chinese are already the world's biggest shoppers abroad, but a report released on January 20th by CLSA forecasts that the number of outbound Chinese tourists will double to 200m a year by 2020 and that their spending will triple over that time. James Button of SmithStreet, a consultancy, reports a well established piece of etiquette: ""You must let friends know when you are going overseas,"" and take along an empty suitcase. 
Many Chinese also use online shopping agents, who aggregate requests and bring back foreign goods. Sales by overseas purchase agents came to nearly 50 billion yuan in 2012, a leap of more than 80% on the year earlier; they jumped by half again last year to 74.4. billion yuan. Foreign websites, including Amazon, now offer direct delivery to China for certain products, and local e-commerce giants such as Alibaba run cross-border services. 
Buying overseas saves money, since mark-ups and hefty taxes are the rule in China. Many ordinary folk travel not just to Hong Kong, the most convenient spot, but to Jeju Island in South Korea (where they can visit without a visa and shop duty-free) to stock up on cosmetics that cost much more at home. Price, though, is not the only motivation. Another is to avoid the counterfeit goods so common on the mainland. Even more important, consumers say, are the variety and freshness of the products available overseas. 
Nowhere is this wide-ranging urge to spend more obvious than in the market for luxury goods. Globally the Chinese are the biggest buyers of expensive items, accounting for some 29% of purchases last year (see chart 2). Some two-thirds of Chinese spending on luxury goods takes place outside the mainland; a fifth of it in Europe. (Harrods of London has seen sales to Chinese shoppers, its largest foreign contingent, increase by 50% a year since 2011.) Consistently favoured brands include Lancome, Gucci, Audi, Rolex and Tiffany. 
The Chinese are also the world's largest consumers of Bordeaux wine and cognac, though sales (like those of Moutai, a local grain alcohol) have fallen in the wake of official campaigns against gift-giving ( 
). At Berry Bros & Rudd's bonded wine warehouse in Basingstoke, in southern England, where 4.5m expensive bottles are stored, more than 1m of those are owned by oenophiles from greater China. No longer, says the firm's chairman, should the Chinese be pictured ruining fine wine by pouring Coca-Cola into it. 
Although a government crackdown on corruption has crimped mainland sales, and some luxury firms slowed down the rollout of new boutiques there last year, Coach, Prada and Bottega Veneta continued to expand. Apple expanded too; it now has more stores in Shanghai than in San Francisco, and launches new iPhones in Beijing when it does in California. Mr Button of SmithStreet thinks brands offering affordable luxury--Michael Kors and Kate Spade, say--can capture both the upwardly mobile and the ""post-luxury"" elites in the cities, who want less flashy brands. 
In the past, the Chinese showed little interest in Western art. That is starting to change, and may change quicker with the opening of a new museum of Western art in Shanghai. The richest man in China has just paid $28m for a Picasso, though he was condemned as ""unpatriotic"" on Sina Weibo. Ms Potter also observes that two-thirds of affluent consumers are keen to know the history and cultural background of foreign brands. So they love to buy Piaget watches in Geneva and Zegna suits in Milan, but reject unconventional offerings such as German watches or Japanese leather bags. 
It is not only in luxury goods that Chinese shoppers are leading the way. China has become the world's biggest e-commerce market, with spending forecast to reach $540 billion next year. On Singles Day, an annual online-marketing extravaganza held on November 11th, 400m Chinese spent $5.7 billion just on Tmall, an e-commerce platform run by Alibaba; Americans, on their Cyber Monday a few weeks later, spent only about $2 billion. China is the world's biggest maker and consumer of smartphones, and will soon be the largest ""mobile-commerce"" market, too. 
Perhaps because they distrust official information, the Chinese rely heavily on peer reviews. Research by BCG has shown that they write, and act on, online reviews of products and services far more than Westerners do. A recent study of purchases of moisturiser found that two-thirds of Chinese buyers relied on online recommendations by friends or family; the comparable figure in America was less than 40%. Millions of online shoppers follow the thoughts of Miumiu and Viviandan, leggy twins from industrial Chongqing, who started posting pictures of themselves in the latest fashions, with wry observations on trends and prices, a decade ago. Even now they post recommendations nearly every day on social-media sites such as Instagram, or on Weibo. Their likes and dislikes make or break products. 
Online shoppers in the remotest parts of China often know a great deal about a global brand's attributes and pricing worldwide--which can put marketers on the back foot. Chinese consumers are no longer willing to pay a hefty premium for any old foreign brand. As they grow more discerning, multinationals are having to work harder to prove their worth--and are having to defend their brands on China's wild social media. But creative approaches can pay off. 
When VF Corporation, a large American clothing firm, wanted to promote The North Face, a brand of outdoor clothing, in China, it struggled. Whereas climbers and hikers in the West relish the thought of conquering mountains alone, the Chinese generally think of outings in Nature as a spiritual escape, to be enjoyed with friends.

THE Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, likens his government's campaign to stop asylum-seekers landing in the country by boat to a military campaign. Four months after he led the conservative Liberal-National coalition to power promising to ""stop the boats"", Mr Abbott is claiming victory in ""Operation Sovereign Borders"". On January 24th his immigration minister, Scott Morrison, claimed that no boat people had arrived in Australian waters for more than a month, the longest boat-free period for nearly five years. Yet Australia's relations with Indonesia, its northern neighbour and the main embarkation point for boat people, have suffered. Marty Natalegawa, Indonesia's foreign minister, calls the Australian approach a ""slippery slope"" which could ""get out of hand"". 
In promising to turn back the boats, Mr Abbott has taken the populist path on boat people that John Howard, his mentor and a former coalition prime minister, promoted over a dozen years ago. Tapping voters' fears about boats swarming from Asia, Mr Howard banished their passengers to camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Ensuing Labor governments were critical of the hardline policy. But in July the then Labor government, under Kevin Rudd, turned more draconian itself. It decreed that those in the camps who won refugee claims would be resettled in Papua New Guinea but never in Australia. After 16,000 asylum-seekers on 220 boats arrived in the first seven months of last year, boat numbers dropped sharply. The slowdown, for which Mr Abbott claims credit, began before he won power in September. 
In ordering the navy to stop vessels carrying asylum-seekers from entering Australian waters--by pushing them back towards Indonesia instead--Mr Abbott has acted in the face of Indonesian objections. In contrast to previous governments, he has also shrouded the operation in secrecy. War against people-smugglers, Mr Abbott says, should not involve giving out ""information...of use to the enemy"". 
Press reports in Australia and Indonesia suggest the navy has pushed up to six boats back. Asylum-seekers on one boat in early January told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that they were badly burned when Australian sailors forced them to touch parts of their boat's engine. Mr Abbott endorsed the navy's denials of having done anything wrong and accused ABC of lacking patriotism. 
It has since emerged that in at least one operation, navy vessels entered Indonesian waters without authority. Indonesia is livid. It has deployed its own warships and military radar to monitor Australia's movements. Mr Natalegawa says Indonesia is ""keen to ensure our sovereign border is properly protected"".

Mr Abbott had promised that Indonesia would be at the heart of his foreign policy. Yet the boats controversy is as damaging as the phone-tapping scandal. Legal experts also say that Australia might have breached its obligations under the United Nations refugee convention by pushing asylum-seekers to another country. (Australia holds more than 4,000 boat people in camps on Christmas Island, an Australian territory, and in Papua New Guinea and Nauru.)

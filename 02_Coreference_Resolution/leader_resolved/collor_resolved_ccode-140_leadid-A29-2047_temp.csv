The most recent dip, on February 13th, followed a report by a Brazilian news agency that Mr Collor had been packed off to hospital--even though at the time the president was swearing in the new health minister at a televised ceremony.
By the conventions of Brazil's presidency Mr Collor is not entitled to a holiday. He has lost weight steadily during his two busy years in office. He insists that his health is sound and, at 42, he maintains a rigorous exercise schedule. But his behaviour is often so quirky that it has left Brazilians uncertain about him.
At the start of the year Mr Collor changed his signature, dropping the ""de"" in his last name, reportedly on the advice of a numerologist. He bean to skip his Sunday jog at which he liked to wear a T-Shirt emblazoned with some political message. He cancelled his regular Tuesday ceremony of walking down the front ramp of the presidential palace with a crowd of beaming supporters. On Wednesday February 5th he stayed home from work.
None of these moves would have been in the least unsettling if Mr Collor had bothered to explain them in advance. Instead he left the Brazilian press to speculate.
In another evolutionary twist, Mr Collor now styles himself a philosopher statesman. He has written a series of broad-based articles in the national newspapers elaborating a social-liberal proposal for reform, a kind of tropical New Deal. It is a far cry from the man who won the election by impressing television audiences as a young and irreverent populist.
All this has highlighted his character as a loner, the chief executive whom almost nobody in the Brazilian capital knows or can communicate with well. Ironically, the president stole the stage from several long-awaited measures he had taken precisely to break his government's isolation. He had fired three ministers hobbled by charges of corruption or inefficiency and replaced them with veteran politicos expected to negotiate better with the Congress.
In addition, he has just had a bit of economic good news. On January 29th the International Monetary Fund approved a $2.1 billion standby loan. Since the agreement is based on the tenth letter of intent Brazil has presented to the IMF since 1983, what mattered was not the documents but the evidence of good relations. In Brazil, which had sparred with the IMF on and off three decades, the accord was widely welcomed as a sign of new financial maturity.
The steady orthodox methods of the finance minister, Marcilio Marques Moreira, have made businessmen feel comfortable. But Mr Moreira's success is by no means assured; the 26% inflation figure in January was the highest it has yet been in Mr Collor's presidency.
A tradition of idiosyncratic presidents is longstanding in Brazil, the product of a huge country with weak institutions and not much history of national consensus building. In some ways Mr Collor reminds Brazilians of one of their odder ex-presidents, the eccentric and mercurial Janio Quadros, who in 1961 resigned with no warning after barely six months in office. He died this month at the age of 75.","Twice in the past two weeks Brazil 's booming stockmarkets have dropped suddenly on rumours about Fernando Collor's health .

Each time, Latin America's booms have turned to bust, as night follows day. Now another boom is in prospect, possibly even under way. Optimism is in the air. Is it yet again doomed to disappointment?

Maybe not. This time the cheer is based on a commodity even the most hopeful of past investors knew was in short supply: sensible economic reform. While the world's eyes were turned towards Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, an equally bold revolution has spread through Latin America. From the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego, governments have started unwinding the old interventionist, protectionist policies. If--still a big if--the reforms are carried through, they offer Latin America its best hope yet of sustained prosperity.

The blame for the continent's long slide lies unambiguously with mismanagement. The region's average real GDP per head is today barely higher than in the mid-1970s. In those days the income of the average Argentine, Brazilian or Mexican was twice that of the average South Korean or Taiwanese. Today the Latins are only half as rich as the Asians. While the dragons were building rapid growth on fast-rising exports, the Latin Americans shielded inefficient local firms behind high trade barriers. State ownership and fat subsidies pushed resources into unproductive industries. Huge budget deficits stoked inflation, while current-account deficits were financed by vast foreign borrowing. In 1982 Mexico found it could not service its debts, triggering the debt crisis. The result was that the 1980s were a lost decade. Latin American GDP per person fell by 11%. Investment collapsed. Companies and workers struggled unproductively with four-digit inflation.

Over the past two years, Mexico and others have shown that there can be life after debt. Throughout Latin America the old model of state control and over-protection is being dumped, and inflation confronted. Balanced budgets, privatisation and trade liberalisation are everywhere the buzzwords. Tight fiscal and monetary control is beating inflation, which has been forced down in Mexico from a peak of 180% to less than 20%, in Argentina from more than 20,000% to 30% a year.

Brazil, to be sure, lumbers along in the rear as a giant and dispirited straggler. With a third of Latin America's population, it still battles with recession and inflation of around 20% a month. But even in Brazil President Fernando Collor's government has started to lower trade barriers and to privatise state firms. Other countries' reforms make Thatcherism seem timid. Mexico is the star performer. And in Argentina, President Carlos Menem is mending one of the continent's broken economies (see pages 17-20).

Moreover, debt is less of an obstacle than it once seemed. Since the Brady plan was launched three years ago, five Latin American countries have reached debt-reduction agreements with their bank creditors. The burden is still heavy, with debt-service payments average in 30% of exports last year; some economists still argue that debt relief is a must. But economic reform lifts the burden of debt far more effectively than forgiveness. It brings capital from abroad to boost growth, enabling countries to service their debts themselves.

The fruits of this hard struggle are beginning to be seen. Latin America's real GDP rose by 3% in 1991. Private capital is flowing in from abroad--more than $40 billion of it in 1991, three times the sum in 1990--to seek out the opportunities reform has opened up. At least half of the money belongs not to foreigners but to Latin Americans, from the $200 billion or so they have salted away against home-grown hyperinflation, in bank accounts from Miami to the Cayman Islands. This is the vote of confidence the makers of the new policies hoped for.

DEMOCRACY IS DELICATE

The new economics has coincided with new politics, as elected governments have replaced military dictators. Here cause and effect are hard to disentangle. In some countries economic discontent helped displace the dictators; in other places tough government was used to push through unpopular economic reforms. Everywhere, however, democracy remains tottery. In Peru on April 5th President Alberto Fujimori won the army's backing as he overthrew the constitution and dismissed Congress. Bolivia's president, Jaime Paz Zamora, has been railing at his country's democratic structures. In Venezuela Carlos Andres Perez has faced first the anger of a Caracas mob, then a military rising.

Such events confirm an obvious worry: that Latin America's progress could still be overturned. This is not a matter only of disgruntled generals. The reforms of the early 1990s have made the rich much better off, but they have as yet done little for those at the bottom of the pile. In Latin America the gap between rich and poor is wider than almost anywhere else in the world, and complicated by racial differences. In Brazil the richest (and palest) 20% of households have incomes 33 times as high as those of the poorest 20%. Across such a divide it takes an awful lot of growth to make the poor feel happier. Venezuela's economy grew by 9% last year, but most people remember it as a year when wages lagged behind prices.

Here is Latin America's toughest challenge. If it faces a choice, that choice is not, as some see it, between reform and votes; it is between reform for a few and reform for the many. True, Taiwan and South Korea pulled off their fairly egalitarian miracles under dictators, and the economy of Chile was turned around under the dictates of Augusto Pinochet. Yet elsewhere in Latin America soldiers have been dreadful governors, bad at running their economies and all too good at enriching their friends. Although the threat of dictatorship is today fiercest in Peru and Venezuela, where reform is unpopular, it need not be so. Where reform has been most thorough, as in Argentina and Mexico, the voters have backed it strongly.

The political picture is mixed, but the economic need is clear: growth must be sought, and it must help the poorest, too. In that quest the best pain-reliever is energetic public-sector reform, cutting waste and redirecting spending to the most urgent social needs. Latin America's governments have plenty of waste to cut. But they have other, more constructive jobs to do as well, and pathetically small resources to do them with. Colombia's government collects less than 14% of GDP in taxes and charges, Peru's only 7%. They should take a tip from Argentina, where the government has clamped down on tax evasion and boosted its revenues to almost 22% of GDP last year.

Public services, always inadequate, collapsed in the lean years of the 1980s. Health, water and the environment were allowed to decay. Education got worse everywhere--and investors shy away from countries with an ignorant workforce. Electorates will rightly demand that, as reform pays off, their governments spend more of its fruits on the things only governments can do; and that tax reform and tax collection are part of the peaceful revolution, along with wise spending.

The resources to provide such spending can come only from richer, more efficient, faster-growing economies. To get them, the most urgent need of all is relief from hyperinflation. President Menem curbed it and got his reward in votes at last year's mid-term elections. Public thankfulness for the replacement of funny money with the real sort gave his government space to push ahead with deeper reforms. Brazil, and the rest, should follow his example.

They must persist, for El Dorado is still far away. Getting there will require capital, most of which must come from the countries themselves. Foreign investment is important as a source of new ideas and technology, but historically it has never driven economic development. That is why luring flown capital home is so vital. Latin American governments must convince their own people that reform is possible. If they cannot, then the capital now returning will disappear in the same fluttering of faxes that brought it home.","Five centuries of fortune-hunting in the lands of El Dorado have lured investors in the quest for old, silver, cattle and oil.

The reforms of the early 1990s have made the rich much better off, but they have as yet done little for those at the bottom of the pile. In Latin America the gap between rich and poor is wider than almost anywhere else in the world, and complicated by racial differences. In Brazil the richest (and palest) 20% of households have incomes 33 times as high as those of the poorest 20%. Across such a divide it takes an awful lot of growth to make the poor feel happier. Venezuela's economy grew by 9% last year, but most people remember it as a year when wages lagged behind prices.

Here is Latin America's toughest challenge. If it faces a choice, that choice is not, as some see it, between reform and votes; it is between reform for a few and reform for the many. True, Taiwan and South Korea pulled off their fairly egalitarian miracles under dictators, and the economy of Chile was turned around under the dictates of Augusto Pinochet. Yet elsewhere in Latin America soldiers have been dreadful governors, bad at running their economies and all too good at enriching their friends. Although the threat of dictatorship is today fiercest in Peru and Venezuela, where reform is unpopular, it need not be so. Where reform has been most thorough, as in Argentina and Mexico, the voters have backed it strongly.

The political picture is mixed, but the economic need is clear: growth must be sought, and it must help the poorest, too. In that quest the best pain-reliever is energetic public-sector reform, cutting waste and redirecting spending to the most urgent social needs. Latin America's governments have plenty of waste to cut. But they have other, more constructive jobs to do as well, and pathetically small resources to do them with. Colombia's government collects less than 14% of GDP in taxes and charges, Peru's only 7%. They should take a tip from Argentina, where the government has clamped down on tax evasion and boosted its revenues to almost 22% of GDP last year.

Public services, always inadequate, collapsed in the lean years of the 1980s. Health, water and the environment were allowed to decay. Education got worse everywhere--and investors shy away from countries with an ignorant workforce. Electorates will rightly demand that, as reform pays off, their governments spend more of its fruits on the things only governments can do; and that tax reform and tax collection are part of the peaceful revolution, along with wise spending.

The resources to provide such spending can come only from richer, more efficient, faster-growing economies. To get them, the most urgent need of all is relief from hyperinflation. President Menem curbed it and got his reward in votes at last year's mid-term elections. Public thankfulness for the replacement of funny money with the real sort gave his government space to push ahead with deeper reforms. Brazil, and the rest, should follow his example.

They must persist, for El Dorado is still far away. Getting there will require capital, most of which must come from the countries themselves. Foreign investment is important as a source of new ideas and technology, but historically it has never driven economic development. That is why luring flown capital home is so vital. Latin American governments must convince their own people that reform is possible. If they cannot, then the capital now returning will disappear in the same fluttering of faxes that brought it home.",140,Brazil,A29-2047,,False,,0,True

Just as Brazil was polishing itself up to receive more than 100 heads of government for the Earth summit, starting on June 3rd in Rio de Janeiro, President Femando Collor de Mello was accused by his brother of corruption.
Pedro Collor de Mello, who at 39 is three years younger than the president, vented his sibling ire on May 24th, in an interview published in Veja, Brazil's leading newsweekly. Pedro accused Fernando of being a secret partner in illicit deals with a prosperous entrepreneur from the family's home state of Alagoas, in north-eastern Brazil. The businessman in question, Paulo Cesar Farias, was treasurer of Fernando Collor's successful election campaign in 1989.
This was the fourth time in recent months that Veja has given space to attacks by Pedro Collor on Mr Farias. Each has cut a little closer to the president. Unlike its forerunners, the latest assault evoked a response. Fernando Collor ordered police and tax authorities to investigate the allegations, offered to give evidence and said he would sue his brother for criminal libel.
In a five-minute address to the nation the president, dressed uncharacteristically in shirtsleeves--and spitting Pedro's name with anger--apologised to Brazilians for his brother's ""foolish and false"" declarations, promising to defend Brazil's democracy ""over and above my family, my suffering and my pain."" Brazilian congressmen agonised before deciding to mount a commission, on the Watergate model, to investigate the president. For democrats the problem is acute: Mr Collor is the first directly elected president after 26 years of military dictatorship and transition. Columnists have agonised over the advisability of resignation, and speculated that the president may not finish his five-year term.
Pedro Collor's supposed motive in unleashing a family feud at this most delicate of moments for his brother was to save the family newspaper by doing down Mr Farias. With a circulation of just 10,000, the paper is only a small part of the lucrative Collor media chain in Alagoas, of which Pedro has been the director. Last year Mr Farias announced his intention to open a competing daily. The president apparently did not share his brother's determination to keep Mr Farias out of the market. So the resentful Pedro collected what he called his ""dossier"" and gave it to Veja. Documents are said to show that Mr Farias failed to pay his taxes and operated a number of undeclared overseas businesses; Mr Farias, confronted by Veja, denied it all.
Pedro Collor said his brother was taking profits from Mr Farias's allegedly illegal businesses, and helping him build a rival voice in Alagoas, over which the president would have full political control. For spice, Pedro claimed that Fernando had introduced him to cocaine when both were teenagers. This, says the president, is a libel. The Collors' elderly mother Leda, the family company's majority stockholder, in mid-May removed Pedro temporarily from directing the business.
In this tangled tale, Brazil's sophisticated and competitive press has shown its newfound muscle. Eager snooping had already turned up case after case of corruption in the Collor government--though nothing out of the ordinary for Brazil's mammoth state bureaucracy. The main effect so far had been to force the president to honour his campaign promises for reform. But in its attack on the president himself, Veja gave space to charges from an interesting but offended source, yet made little apparent effort to verify them.
The excitement will probably be dissipated for a while in the investigations. The charges might have carried more weight had they not been made at such a tender moment. But the falling-out in the first family illuminates a flaw in this huge but stalled country. Brazilians' national political purposes tend to be so vague and weakly held that they are easily overwhelmed by narrow provincial interests.","The timing could not have been worse .

LOOK TO LBJ, NOT FORD
Like many a vice-president, Mr Franco was chosen for the job because of his honest and unremarkable nature. Now 61, with a long career as mayor and senator already behind him, he is not seen as ambitious or strong-willed. True, he used to have the reputation of a nationalist, hostile to privatisation and free-market economics--the very things that Brazil needs and that may now be at risk. Yet many believe Mr Franco's convictions to be less strong than his sense of how to succeed in politics.
With impeachment in the air, the arrival on the scene of a decent nonentity brings to mind the promotion of Gerald Ford after Richard Nixon finally came unstuck in 1974. Honorable as Mr Ford was in the presidency, the hope must be that, if Mr Franco is to model himself on any newly promoted vice-president, it will be Lyndon Johnson after John Kennedy's assassination. Brazil does not need a healer so much as a doer.
The proof of this can be gathered from a glance at the statistics. Brazil is a country where less than a third of the population complete primary school, where the external debt is a quarter of GDP and where prices double every three months. The country is so vast that much of it is beyond the reach of government; yet in the economy, where government should keep out, it is still intimately and disastrously involved. Mr Collor, whatever his personal shortcomings, had many of the right policies for these problems. But he was unable, because of his political inadequacy, to put most of them into practice. In this respect he was like Kennedy, whose ideas became legislation only when Congress-wise LBJ took charge of them.
Mr Franco probably has no more than 27 months--till the next presidential election--in which to make his mark. Politicians generally are held in low esteem in Brazil, and Mr Franco brings to the task neither the backing of a political party (he has none) nor any great popular appeal. Old-fashioned politicians will see this as their chance to return to the bad old days. Yet even those on the left in Brazil acknowledge the need to liberalise the economy and reduce the role of the state. If Mr Franco, from his disinterested position, can invigorate a majority in Congress to press on with Mr Collor's reforms, he can at least bequeath his countrymen a strengthened economy. If so, the events of this week may come to be seen not as the prelude to another period of economic decline and political incompetence, but as the workings of a successful democracy.","Of all the opportunities that come with democracy ; the one that gives most pleasure is , without doubt , that of kicking the rascals out .

In 1990 the handsome young president from the obscure state of Alagoas swept into office promising to slay corruption and liberate Brazil from its self-isolating economic policies. To some degree, he succeeded. Thanks partly to his lectures, Brazilians will no longer put up with the venal politics of the past. So when they discovered their saviour's hand in the till, they showed no mercy.
On September 29th the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Brazil's Congress, voted by 441 votes to 38 in favour of impeaching Mr Collor. Technically he is now suspended for 180 days while the case goes to the Senate for trial. But his presidency is surely over. Though he refused at first to contemplate resigning, he may be hoping to do so in return for a pardon from his successor. Under the constitution, this must be the vice-president, Itamar Franco. Without a pardon, Mr Collor will probably soon face common criminal charges, in addition to his trial by the Senate.
The decisive vote in the Chamber of Deputies, which had to secure only a two-thirds majority, was greeted with jubilation. On the grassy esplanade outside the Congress building, tens of thousands of demonstrators, their faces painted in the national colours of green and yellow, set off a shower of fireworks. The capital erupted with the honking of cars and yells of joy. Nor was the excitement confined to Brasilia. All over the country Brazilians saw each other celebrating on television. As promised, the entire cabinet offered its resignation.
Impeaching your president is not an obvious cause for delight. In this case the fateful vote was taken as a sin that Latin America's biggest democracy had come of age. The deputies had at last exercised the powers vested in them by the constitution of 1988. They had struck a blow for clean government, without fear that the generals who ran the country from 1964 to 1985 would come marching out of their barracks. Above all, they had listened to, and acted on, the overwhelming wish of the people.
Mr Collor's downfall began in May as a family feud. His younger brother Pedro denounced him in the press as the ""front man"" for Paulo Cesar Farias, a businessman from Alaoas. ""P.C."", as Mr Farias is known in Brazil, was accused of running a huge bribery ring inside the government. Within three months a congressional investigation had confirmed the story. It found that Mr Farias had exploited his friendship with the president to extract millions of dollars in bribes from businessmen seeking government contracts. In return, Mr Farias passed money to Mr Collor through secret bank accounts. The president spent $2.5m of it sprucing up his family's gardens.
Ordinary Brazilians were unamused. Mr Collor had, after all, spent more than two years lecturing them on the virtues of belt-tightening. Since his election in March 1990, the real wages of federal employees have fallen by half, and the minimum wage is worth less than it has ever been since its creation more than half a century ago. Unemployment has soared and inflation has been running at more than 20% a month.
The evidence of presidential wrong-doing galvanised the press. Fearlessly, and often recklessly, the newspapers hounded the president and kept the story before the public. Hundreds of thousands of citizens, many of them students, sustained the pace of playful and peaceful mobilisation for two months. For them, the slow and difficult transition from 21 stifling years of military rule was at last over. Last time Brazilians turned out on the streets--to campaign in 1984 for direct elections to the presidency--Congress closed its ears. This time it was the people who got their way.
Mr Collor is said to have taken his defeat in Congress without flinching. The same apparent detachment from reality has characterised his handling of the scandal from the beginning. Now he enters a legal netherworld where he will be allowed to enjoy his presidential salary and almost all the perquisites of office while preparing a defence before the Senate.
BRACE FOR THE HANGOVER
After the party, Brazil needs to come to terms with the vastly different style of Mr Franco. Mr Collor, at 43, was a good-looking, telegenic reformer. Mr Franco, at 61, is a civil engineer and career politician from the mountainous mining state of Minas Gerais. He has a spotless reputation (one columnist has gone so far as to call him ""a slave to high ethics""). But he also carries some of the pro-labour, anti-competition ideological baggage that many other Brazilians have abandoned.
In the Senate Mr Franco has been a bitter critic of the IMF. He has questioned the need for Brazil to repay its foreign debt. The new president's home state was one of the few regions to thrive during the past three decades of state-dominated, tariff-sealing policies. Recently, Mr Franca criticised the government for successfully selling off Usiminas, a big state-owned steel mill in Minas Gerais. It is not, he says, that he opposes privatisation in principle; only that it seems wrong to sell off first of all the handful of publicly owned companies that are truly profitable.
Yet it is far too early to assume that Brazil's change of president means an equally dramatic change of policy. For one thing, Mr Franco is in no position to make economic policy all on his own. As a quirky gentleman-politician without a party, he will have to bend to the will of the opposition coalition that organised Mr Collor's impeachment. And (in an ironic tribute to Mr Collor's achievements) all members of this coalition, including the parties of the left, say they want to persist with reforms to cut state spending and expose the economy to foreign competition. ""The name of the next finance minister"", said Orestes Qeuercia, the head of the Brazil Democratic Movement Party, the biggest party of all, ""is tax and structural reform.""
Besides, Mr Franco's own views may recently have altered. ""I'm not the only one who has changed. The world changed,"" he said last weekend. The extraordinary circumstances in which he became president will guarantee him some goodwill in Congress, at least for a while. That may help him to push through the urgent tax reforms needed to curb inflation. How peculiar it would be--and how excellent for Brazil--if Mr Franco, a reluctant bystander during many of Mr Collor's reforms, became the man who put them properly into practice.","If ever a politician was impaled on his own sword , it was Fernando Collor . In 1990 Fernando Collor swept into office promising to slay corruption and liberate Brazil from its self - isolating economic policies . To some degree , Fernando Collor succeeded . Thanks partly to Fernando Collor's lectures , Brazilians will no longer put up with the venal politics of the past . So when they discovered Fernando Collor's hand in the till , they showed no mercy . 
 On September 29th the Chamber of Deputies , the lower house of Brazil 's Congress , voted by 441 votes to 38 in favour of impeaching Fernando Collor . Technically Fernando Collor is now suspended for 180 days while the case goes to the Senate for trial . But Fernando Collor's presidency is surely over . Though Fernando Collor refused at first to contemplate resigning , Fernando Collor may be hoping to do so in return for a pardon from Fernando Collor's successor . Under the constitution , this must be the vice - president , Itamar Franco . Without a pardon , Fernando Collor will probably soon face common criminal charges , in addition to Fernando Collor's trial by the Senate . 
 The decisive vote in the Chamber of Deputies , which had to secure only a two - thirds majority , was greeted with jubilation . On the grassy esplanade outside the Congress building , tens of thousands of demonstrators , their faces painted in the national colours of green and yellow , set off a shower of fireworks . The capital erupted with the honking of cars and yells of joy . Nor was the excitement confined to Brasilia . All over the country Brazilians saw each other celebrating on television . As promised , the entire cabinet offered its resignation . 
 Impeaching your president is not an obvious cause for delight . In this case the fateful vote was taken as a sin that Latin America 's biggest democracy had come of age . The deputies had at last exercised the powers vested in them by the constitution of 1988 . They had struck a blow for clean government , without fear that the generals who ran the country from 1964 to 1985 would come marching out of their barracks . Above all , they had listened to , and acted on , the overwhelming wish of the people . 
 Fernando Collor's downfall began in May as a family feud . Fernando Collor's younger brother Pedro denounced Fernando Collor in the press as the "" front man "" for Paulo Cesar Farias , a businessman from Alaoas . "" P.C. "" , as Mr Farias is known in Brazil , was accused of running a huge bribery ring inside the government . Within three months a congressional investigation had confirmed the story . It found that Mr Farias had exploited his friendship with Fernando Collor to extract millions of dollars in bribes from businessmen seeking government contracts . In return , Mr Farias passed money to Fernando Collor through secret bank accounts . Fernando Collor spent $ 2.5 m of it sprucing up Fernando Collor's family 's gardens . 
 Ordinary Brazilians were unamused . Fernando Collor had , after all , spent more than two years lecturing them on the virtues of belt - tightening . Since Fernando Collor's election in March 1990 , the real wages of federal employees have fallen by half , and the minimum wage is worth less than it has ever been since its creation more than half a century ago . Unemployment has soared and inflation has been running at more than 20 % a month . 
 The evidence of presidential wrong - doing galvanised the press . Fearlessly , and often recklessly , the newspapers hounded Fernando Collor and kept the story before the public . Hundreds of thousands of citizens , many of them students , sustained the pace of playful and peaceful mobilisation for two months . For them , the slow and difficult transition from 21 stifling years of military rule was at last over . Last time Brazilians turned out on the streets -- to campaign in 1984 for direct elections to the presidency -- Congress closed its ears . This time it was the people who got their way . 
 Fernando Collor is said to have taken Fernando Collor's defeat in Congress without flinching . The same apparent detachment from reality has characterised Fernando Collor's handling of the scandal from the beginning . Now Fernando Collor enters a legal netherworld where Fernando Collor will be allowed to enjoy Fernando Collor's presidential salary and almost all the perquisites of office while preparing a defence before the Senate . 
 BRACE FOR THE HANGOVER 
 After the party , Brazil needs to come to terms with the vastly different style of Mr Franco . Mr Collor , at 43 , was a good - looking , telegenic reformer . Mr Franco , at 61 , is a civil engineer and career politician from the mountainous mining state of Minas Gerais . He has a spotless reputation ( one columnist has gone so far as to call him "" a slave to high ethics "" ) . But he also carries some of the pro - labour , anti - competition ideological baggage that many other Brazilians have abandoned . 
 In the Senate Mr Franco has been a bitter critic of the IMF . He has questioned the need for Brazil to repay its foreign debt . The new president 's home state was one of the few regions to thrive during the past three decades of state - dominated , tariff - sealing policies . Recently , Mr Franca criticised the government for successfully selling off Usiminas , a big state - owned steel mill in Minas Gerais . It is not , he says , that he opposes privatisation in principle ; only that it seems wrong to sell off first of all the handful of publicly owned companies that are truly profitable . 
 Yet it is far too early to assume that Brazil 's change of president means an equally dramatic change of policy . For one thing , Mr Franco is in no position to make economic policy all on his own . As a quirky gentleman - politician without a party , he will have to bend to the will of the opposition coalition that organised Fernando Collor's impeachment . And ( in an ironic tribute to Fernando Collor's achievements ) all members of this coalition , including the parties of the left , say they want to persist with reforms to cut state spending and expose the economy to foreign competition . "" The name of the next finance minister "" , said Orestes Qeuercia , the head of the Brazil Democratic Movement Party , the biggest party of all , "" is tax and structural reform . "" 
 Besides , Mr Franco 's own views may recently have altered . "" I 'm not the only one who has changed . The world changed , "" he said last weekend . The extraordinary circumstances in which he became president will guarantee him some goodwill in Congress , at least for a while . That may help him to push through the urgent tax reforms needed to curb inflation . How peculiar it would be -- and how excellent for Brazil -- if Mr Franco , a reluctant bystander during many of Fernando Collor's reforms , became the man who put them properly into practice .",140,Brazil,A29-2047,IN TERM,True,Fernando Collor de Mello,32,True

Brazil's new president, Itamar Franco, was sworn in on December 29th after his predecessor, Fernando Collor de Mello, disgraced in a corruption scandal, was shoved out of office. Given the overwhelming problems facing Brazil, the new president may well understand Mr Truman's sentiments.
One of Mr Franco's first acts as president was to send removal men to reclaim public property from Casa da Dinda, the house in Brasilia where Mr Collor lives. Item by item, the house was picked clean. Even the rubbish bins were taken away. Mr Collor, in jeans and shirtsleeves and without the customary sheen of gel on his hair, looked on as the relics of his regime were carted off.
For Mr Collor, the youthful president who had promised nothing less than to reinvent Brazil, it was a shabby ending. But the rest of the country breathed a sigh of relief. After seven agonising months of the Collor affair, Brazil could get on with the urgent tasks at hand. Awaiting the new president is an economy which last year saw annual inflation of 1,200%, three-digit real interest rates, a mounting budget deficit and stagnation.
In principle, Mr Franco is well positioned to take on these challenges. The felling of the former president has made the new one popular. A recent poll found that 79% of Brazilians backed him. Thunderous applause and a rousing chorus of the national anthem welcomed this unlikely hero as he walked into Congress and took the oath of office. The question now is whether he intends to use this support to push through urgently needed reforms.
Mr Franco's predecessor, for all his arrogance and avarice, nevertheless had a clear idea of which way he wanted Brazil to go. A free-market enthusiast, Mr Collor set out to remake one of the world's most protected economies by slashing the bureaucracy, auctioning state-owned companies, improving relations with foreign creditors and toppling trade barriers.
The new president has so far evinced no such sense of direction. For 88 days, as the corruption saga dragged on, he did little more than keep the president's seat warm. He has named an unremarkable cabinet, shunned interviews and twice cancelled addresses to the nation. Meanwhile, bills calling for fiscal reform, deregulation of government services and the restructuring of political parties were left stranded in Congress. Indeed, Mr Franco's most notable decision to date has been to suspend the privatisation programme, which has not only upset foreign investors but also led to the resignation of his finance minister.
Since taking office, Mr Franco has continued to send mixed signals. To reassure foreign creditors, he has promised not to propose any ""shock"" plans, such as the disastrous price freezes of past governments, and to honour the newly minted pact to reschedule payments on $44 billion of private bank debt. He also stresses that he has not scrapped the privatisation programme, merely delayed it. Nonetheless, his first speech as president contained a stinging attack on Mr Collor's free-market ideas. ""The much-touted banner of modernity has impoverished the country 10% in only 30 months,"" he said. ""Everyone wants to modernise the country, and we will, but without impoverishing the middle class or worsening the plight of workers.""
This sort of talk is not so reassuring, hinting as it does that Brazil may return to its long tradition of protectionism. It also suggests a worrying reluctance to take an axe to the budget. He has spoken of Brazil's ""savage capitalism"", brawled with pharmaceutical firms over price rises, held down utility prices to ease the lot of the poor and berated banks for soaring interest rates.
Even if Mr Franco does discover a sense of direction, he will have to work hard to capture the attention of Congress and the country in the months ahead. He is affiliated to no political party, which will make it harder to steer his ideas through a Congress that has recently discovered that it can test its power against a president and win. An early test of his ability to gather the parties around him is due on January 11th, when Congress will meet in a special session to vote on an economic plan.
In April, moreover, Brazilians will o to the polls in a referendum on the constitution. They will be asked to decide whether they want to keep a strong presidency, install a parliamentary system, or even--outlandishly--retreat to a monarchy. Surveys show a slight preference for a parliamentary system over a presidency. But they also show that 60% have no idea what the choice really means.
For Mr Franco, none of the constitutional outcomes will be particularly helpful in subduing inflation or taming interest rates. Both of those will require a strong nerve-and a readiness to take unpopular decisions. He does not have long. The race for the 1995 elections begins early next year, after which no politician will want to propose continued austerity. The moon and a couple of planets have only just fallen on Mr Franco. The funny thin is that he is already running out of time.","When Harry Truman assumed the American presidency after Franklin Roosevelt 's death in 1945 , he "" felt as though the moon and a couple of planets "" had just fallen on him .

The people who used to make their homes along the river, sallow and with distended bellies, hang about the health post set up by the government's Indian agency. In Roraima province, South America's largest surviving tribe of forest Indians is under siege again.
Until recently, the Yanomami people lived as they had always done, on what they could find along the rivers that become the upper Amazon. But extensive deposits of gold were discovered on their lands in 1987, and since then their native lands have been invaded by waves of prospectors and diggers, bringing guns, strong drink, pollution of the rivers and the microbes of civilisation.
In 1990 militant greens transformed the Yanomami into a casus belli, and nudged Brazil's government into doing something. With much publicity, it blew up the airstrips upon which the garimpeiros (claim-stakers) depended, and airlifted some 35,000 of them out of Indian territory. In May 1992, seeking favourable publicity on the eve of the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro, President Fernando Collor de Mello announced that the Yanomami lands had at long last been allocated to the indigenous people. But the summit is over, Mr Collor is in disgrace and all is back to normal.
Brazilians know the script. Three times since the 1987 gold rush the miners have been ordered out of Yanomami land. Mr Collor's clearance cost the federal government almost $2m. The next clearance, due in late February, is likely to cost nearly as much.
The garimpeiros will be back. Poor semi-nomads with primitive technology, they have few champions and fewer alternative ways of surviving. Most of them have fled sharecropper plots in the wretchedly poor north-east of Brazil for a dream of jungle riches. In 1990 wildcat miners produced some 12 tons of gold and 500,000 carats of diamonds. The merchants and dealers of the state capital, Boa Vista, got the money. The dreamers, living impoverished in the slums, have the consolation of contemplating a giant concrete garimpeiro in the middle of the main square.
The Indians are another matter. Local people tend to start by fretting over the hapless natives, and end up frothing over America's largest surviving tribe of crest Indians is under siege again. their sloth and guile. Special venom is reserved for the priests and gringo ecologists who, the locals claim, are exploiting the Yanomami as cover behind which to prise away lands that belong to all Brazilians. The merchants of Boa Vista, specialists in separating miners from their money, ardently defend the gold trade.
In hard reality, federal subsidies have done more than bullion to keep Roraima afloat. Now the federal government is broke, and the scramble for minerals therefore grows fiercer. At the top of the state's last boom, two years ago, new cars swept along the newly paved streets of Boa Vista, high-rise towers began to sprout. Gold was the currency, with everything from a car to a prostitute's services priced in grams or kilos. When the miners were flushed out, slump followed.
Last November, as a new gold boom got under way, land prices tripled in the state capital. Would-be garimpeiros poured in from other states. Now they sit listlessly on the steps of flophouses, waiting for the next evacuation.
All save the most ardent defenders of the Yanomami now agree that they must change or perish--but by persuasion, not force. Consultation is not easy. Few Indians can handle even the rudiments of Portuguese, let alone negotiate royalties, joint-ventures, or environmental-impact statements.
Yet there is enough room, and mineral wealth, in the Amazon's generous folds to harbour miners and Indians alike--apart if need be. Some tribes probably could make deals that would bring wealth without embargoing development. But that would require order, planning and democratic discussion.

They were afraid he would administer a ""heterodox shock"": freeze wages and prices and introduce a new currency. He reassured them by promising to honour the country's debts and to continue Mr Collor's policy of privatisation. They started worrying again when he threatened to control the prices of drugs. He has also taken personal control of the privatisation scheme, thereby bringing it to a halt.
The clouds thickened on March 1st with the resignation of Paulo Haddad, the second economy minister to resin during Mr Franco's brief tenure. The governor of the central bank has also said he will go, and the bank's entire directorate has announced its intention to walk out with him. Mr Haddad says he resigned because Mr Franco decided--without consulting him--to fill posts at the central bank with political appointees rather than trained economists.
The departures are not surprising. Mr Franco has made life difficult for his economics team by criticising and contradicting their work, while offering no clear plan of his own. He has made curbing inflation, now nearly 30% a month (see chart above), a main aim of his administration. But he has also insisted that interest rates must be brought down, thereby depriving the economy ministry of one of its few weapons against inflation. In January the central bank raised interest rates. Mr Franco tried hard to reverse the decision, backing down only after an ugly public row. Last week he hinted that he would fire Mr Haddad if he did not bring inflation under control within three months.
Within hours of Mr Haddad's resignation, Mr Franco named Eliseu Rezende, the head of the government-owned electricity company, Eletrobras, as his new economy minister. The swiftness of the decision calmed investors at the jittery Sao Paulo bourse But Mr Rezende is an engineer better known for his friendship with the president than for his rasp of economics.
He will have to learn fast. Brazil needs to convince the IMF of the soundness of its economic proposals in order to win the release of a $2.1 billion stand-by loan frozen since last year. This in turn would allow Brazil to repay $44 billion of foreign bank debt on more comfortable terms. As it happened, an IMF team arrived in Brazil just when the economy minister and his team were announcing their resignations.
Will Mr Franco let his new minister develop a sensible economic plan? The omens are bad. The president's recent flap over high car prices illustrates the point. He decided that one solution would be to bring back the Volkswagen Beetle, that much-loved ""people's car"", by granting large concessions to the manufacturer to reintroduce the model. Actions like these have economists and investors moaning about Mr Franco's lack of serious economic ideas.

Monuments to the Liberator are commonplace in South America, but caraquenos--as residents of Venezuela's capital are known-are particularly proud of their native son. So great was their confidence in Bolivar that few objected in 1821 when, to thank Britain for its help in defeating Spain, he gave permission to British soldiers to march through Caracas with flags unfurled and bayonets fixed.
Flags and bayonets are still on the minds of caraquenos. On March 12th, the annual flag day, teachers dutifully marched their pupils through town squares waving the national banner. That night, however, fears of yet another attempt at a coup--soldiers tried twice in 1992 to overthrow President Carlos Andres Perez-rippled through the city. The cafes of Sabana Grande, a trendy boulevard normally overflowing with weekend merry-makers, were nearly empty.
The rumours followed extraordinary 60ing-on the previous day. Last year's attempted coups had been motivated, the plotters said at the time, by the desire to end corruption in high places. On March 11th accusations of corruption had the president under siege again.
First came student protests all over the country. Then some opposition politicians stalked out when Mr Perez delivered his sombre annual address to Congress. Finally, the attorney-general, Ramon Escovar, accused the president of misusing public funds. He sent a detailed charge to the supreme court, which must now decide whether there is enough evidence for a trial. All in all, although there was no coup, it was not a good day for Mr Perez.
The next few months are not likely to et much better. With presidential elections due in December, few prominent politicians--even from Mr Perez's own Democratic Action Party--have come to the defence of a man whose popularity ratings are now perilously close to single figures. The attorney-general's decision to bring charges on Mr Perez's big day may have been motivated by presidential ambitions of his own. Mr Escovar's detractors point out that the question of the missing funds was already under investigation both in Congress and by a separate tribunal.
The president is not daunted. The buildings around his Miraflores palace in Caracas still bear the scars of bullets from recent attempted coups. But in an interview, Mr Perez said he was confident that he would be cleared of the corruption charges, and that he still hoped to be remembered as the man who set Venezuela on a new course.
He has undoubtedly presided over an economic turnaround since taking office in 19B9. The previous government, spending freely as if the oil boom had never ended, had run down its reserves and could not service its foreign debt. Mr Perez's programme of trade liberalisation, privatisation and spending cuts has transformed one of the region's most closed economies into one of its most inviting. GDP grew by 10.4% in 1991 and 7.3% last year; the unemployment rate dropped from 10% to 8% over the same period.
Inflation remains stubbornly over 30%, and in 1992 the central government ran a deficit equal to 3.6o of GNP (up from a 2.7% surplus just a year earlier). This has led to pressure on the bolivar, prompting the central bank to raise interest rates. To the dismay of the IMF, Congress has delayed plans for further privatisation and for a much needed package of tax reforms. Even so, Mr Perez's general management of the economy has won praise from foreign bankers. Venezuela sucked in $2 billion from foreign investors during 1992 alone.
Why, then, is the president so unpopular? In part, because of the persistent but so far unproven charges of corruption. In part, because he is a victim of his country's recent history. In the 1970s Venezuela was the world's third-largest exporter of oil. Oil earnings have slumped but people still expect to live well. Although real wages have risen for the past two years, and 270,000 new jobs were created in 1992, the standard of living for most people is lower than it was a decade ago. Economists may admire the president's drive to scrap subsidies for basic services, which benefit the middle class as well as the poor, with aid directed at the worst-off. But consumers hate the price rises for electricity, water and other essentials. They are tired of suffering while their leaders prosper, and long for change.
The change is more likely to come about through the ballot box than as a result of another attempted coup. Some disgruntled officers would not mind having another o at Mr Perez before his term expires. But their failure last November, when the population ignored their calls to take up arms, suggest that they would not receive popular support. In the state and local elections held immediately after that attempt, voters inflicted heavy punishment on the ruling party. The opposition won most of the state governorships at stake. In Caracas itself Aristobulo Isturiz, leader of La Causa R, a small radical party, was elected mayor by the votes of angry slum-dwellers.
Those elections have left a spread of candidates and parties believing that they have a real chance to win power in December's presidential contest. Their ambition helps to keep the army at bay. During the first attempted coup in 1992, some opposition politicians tacitly supported the mutineers. Some may even have helped them. But nowadays even Mr Isturiz's hot-blooded Radicals oppose military intervention in politics. Mr Isturiz says he is confident of his party's victory and eager for elections.
As for Mr Perez, his supporters liken his embattled administration to that of Mexico's President Miguel de la Madrid, whose unpopular economic reforms prepared the ground for the later successes of President Carlos Salinas. History may indeed judge him a courageous economic reformer. But if the corruption charges stick, his fate is likely to bear a closer resemblance to that of Brazil's Fernando Collor, forced out of office in disgrace last year when Congress caught him with his hand in the till.","In the heart of Caracas stands an imposing statue of Simon Bolivar, poised on his ferocious steed. Monuments to the Liberator are commonplace in South America, but caraquenos--as residents of Venezuela's capital are known-are particularly proud of their native son. So great was their confidence in Bolivar that few objected in 1821 when, to thank Britain for its help in defeating Spain, he gave permission to British soldiers to march through Caracas with flags unfurled and bayonets fixed.
Flags and bayonets are still on the minds of caraquenos. On March 12th, the annual flag day, teachers dutifully marched their pupils through town squares waving the national banner. That night, however, fears of yet another attempt at a coup--soldiers tried twice in 1992 to overthrow President Carlos Andres Perez-rippled through the city. The cafes of Sabana Grande, a trendy boulevard normally overflowing with weekend merry-makers, were nearly empty.
The rumours followed extraordinary 60ing-on the previous day. Last year's attempted coups had been motivated, the plotters said at the time, by the desire to end corruption in high places. On March 11th accusations of corruption had the president under siege again.
First came student protests all over the country. Then some opposition politicians stalked out when Mr Perez delivered his sombre annual address to Congress. Finally, the attorney-general, Ramon Escovar, accused the president of misusing public funds. He sent a detailed charge to the supreme court, which must now decide whether there is enough evidence for a trial. All in all, although there was no coup, it was not a good day for Mr Perez.
The next few months are not likely to et much better. With presidential elections due in December, few prominent politicians--even from Mr Perez's own Democratic Action Party--have come to the defence of a man whose popularity ratings are now perilously close to single figures. The attorney-general's decision to bring charges on Mr Perez's big day may have been motivated by presidential ambitions of his own.

1993-04-17,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224180440/fulltext/1FCE329560684147PQ/10?accountid=14657,"""Ordem e progresso"". The motto on Brazil's flag says much about its people. For most of the century, this land of bountiful resources has overflowed with optimism. For all its mix of races, of a few very rich and millions very poor, it has not suffered vast social unrest. Its economic progress has been impressive: from 1940 to 1980, output grew at an average of 7% a year, to make this the world's tenth-largest economy. Brazilians used to point proudly to their satellite programme and a substantial trade surplus, much of it in manufactured goods. Surely, they said, such achievements proved the old saying that God is Brazilian.
But all is not well in paradise. The social order which has lasted so many years is today threatened by a dramatic decline in the welfare of the nation's poor. The fiscal imprudence that has helped to fuel Brazil's infamous inflation--it has been above 20% a month for an unprecedented year and a half--has been an insidious tax on the poor. Recent census figures show that the gap between the top tenth of the population, which controls nearly half the nation's wealth, and the bottom tenth, which owns less than 1%, is among the worst in the world and getting worse still. Thousands of homeless have taken to the streets of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in recent weeks to complain of their plight.
The growth that made inequality tolerable has slowed. While the rest of Latin America was taming inflation and adopting sound fiscal and monetary policies during the 1980s, Brazil continued its profligate ways. Economic mismanagement--encouraged by a fractious and corrupt political system--has helped to double government spending in the past decade and has plunged the formerly robust economy into recession. Despite strong exports, the economy has stagnated since 1989 and GDP per head fell by 5% during the 1980s.
Brazil's industrial economy has historically been government-driven--or, more exactly, government-coddled. It needs to be transformed into one led by private enterprise. The government itself has been a conduit for draining wealth from the pockets of the poor into the wallets of the rich. It needs to become a force for order, progress and--by opening the economy--for development. There is not much sign of that; and the legislature, worried about protecting its own power, has been blocking needed reforms.
With order and progress nowhere in sight, cynicism and distrust of government have replaced the faith that many Brazilians, not long ago, used to have in their leaders. So many of the educated and moneyed elite have left in frustration and disgust that, for the first time, Brazilians have begun to worry about a ""brain drain"".
Better times may be on the way. On April 21st, Brazilians will vote in a--binding--referendum, to decide (a) whether their country should retain its presidential system of government or adopt a parliamentary system, and (b) whether to remain a republic or revert to monarchy (Brazil had an emperor for much of the 19th century). Whatever the outcome, Edith in the governmental structure has been so weakened that ordinary Brazilians may yet take far more of their nation's future into their own hands than they ever dreamed of.
PRESIDENTIAL FAILURES
Many among Brazil's elite believe that the nation's woes are due to the failure of the presidential system. After two decades of military rule, Brazil returned to democracy with the indirect election of Tancredo Neves as president. But Mr Neves fell fatally ill just before his inauguration in 1985, leaving an unprepared vice-president, Jose Sarney, to bungle his way through the rest of his term. Brazilians then pinned their hopes on dashing young Fernando Collor, who promised a revolutionary modernisation of the economy. After he fell in a corruption scandal last December, Brazil found itself again with an unprepared vice-president, Itamar Franco, holding the levers of power. His erratic and autocratic behaviour has only encouraged critics of the present system.
Parliamentarians see in this failure of leadership the best argument for their cause. Bolivar Lamounier, a political scientist, points to the time it took to get President Collor impeached. Though all ended well--Mr Collor ultimately was forced to resign--Mr Lamounier believes that Brazil needs a system that makes it possible to remove the nation's leader with a simple no-confidence vote in the legislature, even if that power is never exercised. Parliamentarians also argue that the coalition-building inherent in their system ensures legislative support for the executive. Today, Mr Franco, who has no party affiliation of his own, must dole out favours among no fewer than 19 parties in the legislature to get his measures through.
It was the parliamentarians who, after losing to the presidential camp in the drafting of the 1988 constitution, joined with the few oddball monarchists to insert a clause calling for a popular vote on the issue in September 1993. In the heat of last year's impeachment saga, they persuaded congress to bring the referendum forward to April. Ostensibly, the aim was to offer a means of ousting Mr Collor if impeachment failed; in reality, the parliamentarians hoped to capitalise on anti-Collor sentiment. Much to their charing, recent opinion polls indicate that voters still prefer a presidential system to a parliamentary one (though ""don't know"" has been the commonest response).
The monarchists too have fared poorly in the polls, though neither their recent scores--15-20%--nor their arguments are negligible. They accept the parliamentarians' case against the present system, but, they claim, offer a better replacement. A constitutional monarchy, as in Britain or Spain, would be best for Brazil, argues Mario Henrique Simonsen, a former finance minister, because a king--unlike any elected president, however powerless--is likely to be a truly disinterested leader, above party politics and personal ambition. The hardest part of the monarchists' campaign has been trying to keep the pretenders to the throne looking real. There are two rival camps of royal descendants, both split within themselves. Their antics have done much to damage the monarchist cause.
Many ordinary Brazilians do not really care. And despite rowing media attention--voters have been treated to an hour a day of television coverage, on top of fierce advertising campaigns--many still do not understand the different options.
A FIERCE CAMPAIGN
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's foreign minister, says democracy is not at stake in the referendum. The outcome, he believes, will be respected by the losers. Maybe, but the functioning of democracy will at least be disturbed. If presidentialism loses, the transition will throw into disarray Mr Franco's already disorganized administration. Even if it wins, that will be the tendency: with elections to state governments, congress and the presidency slated to take place simultaneously in late 1994, the presidential Champaign is sure to start early.
The leading candidates are Paulo Maluf, a conservative and former governor of Sao Paulo state who recently became mayor of Sao Paulo city, and Luis Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva, from the Workers' Party, who lost the presidential run-off to Mr Collor in 1989. Opinion polls show a fierce and divisive campaign in the making. Mr Lamounier fears that that may be too much for the fragile democratic institutions of his country. The campaign may turn violent and--whoever wins it--seems likely to give the victor a tenuous hold on power.
SONY, BUT GROWTH IS NOW ILLEGAL
All this politickin also risks derailing a more important matter, a constitutional review due next October. This will be separate from the referendum, though of course incorporating its results; and the effects could (and should) be great.
The review spring from a clause in the 1988 constitution which lays down that, after a trial period of five years, the congress should convene as a constituent assembly to revise it. Already there is a move afoot to delay the review until the next president (if there is one) has taken over, but most observers believe it will go ahead this year. Given the straitjacket the present constitution places on the economy, it better had.
The constitution was drafted to guide Brazil's transition to democracy. Its framers, uplifted by the end of military rule, included inspiring commitments to human rights and civil liberties. Alas, they also included much of the Brazilian tradition of protectionism and paternalism, along with special privileges for umpteen interest groups. The result is a tome which Geraldo Brindeiro, a deputy attorney general, calls ""a detailed programme of government, instead of a simple outline of rights and rules about power"". Still worse, the programme thus detailed is a restrictive, inward-looking one which has done much to weaken both the economy and the effectiveness of government.
A good example is the restriction on foreign investment. Caving in to interest groups, the drafters of the document placed strict limits on foreign equity participation in many sectors. One result has been a drop in new investment in mining: at only $40m in 1992, this has fallen to a quarter of the 1988 level. Similar constraints have held up a much-needed pipeline from Bolivia to Brazil, which would provide energy-hungry Sao Paulo state with cheaper fuel.
Besides handcuffing the private sector, the constitution also enshrines the inefficient and overmanned state sector. The few half-hearted efforts made to trim the government payroll have been stymied by a guarantee of lifetime employment for long-serving public-sector employees. Efforts to reform the tax code or raise revenues have run foul of constitutional restrictions and require a special vote by congress. Such haggles tied up this year's budget, which was formulated last August but approved only at the end of March.
Another constitutional folly is the over-representation in the legislature of states outside the populous south. This was insisted on by the generals, who felt their interests would be better served by politicians from the backward north-east and north. So Sao Paulo state has nearly a quarter of the country's population, but barely a tenth of the seats in congress. Southerners are justifiably angry at the way their interests get short shrift. There is talk in the southernmost states, some of it serious, of secession.
The authors of the constitution, in their zeal to limit central power in the new democracy, also called for a dramatic shift of revenues to states and municipalities. The idea was that half the income of the federal government would be passed on to localities, which would then take over services such as health and education. The revenues have shifted. The responsibilities have not, partly because the federal bureaucracy has been unwilling to give up power. The result is that the federal government has to spend money it does not have--so it borrows or simply prints the money instead.
State and local authorities, by contrast, are rolling in money--not only from tax revenues, but from the central bank--and the patronage that it makes possible. Though their responsibilities have not grown significantly, their payrolls have swollen from 8% to 12% of GDP in the past five years.
The inevitable result has been continued inflation. Add to this the economic folly of the constitution's protection of government jobs and its barriers against foreign investment, and you can understand the lament of Roberto Campos, a leading economist and former finance minister: ""Our constitution is a miracle--it is at once inflationary and recessionary. The stagflation we are now suffering from is constitutionally mandated.""
BACK TO BASICS
There has been no shortage of heterodox shock plans promising to solve the nation's economic woes, above all inflation. None has worked. A growing number of respectable economists and politicians now wonder whether any anti-inflation plan can work. Brazilians, they suggest, are too inured to high inflation, indeed have learned to profit handsomely from it. They talk of a parasitic ""culture of inflation"", visible in the wealthy enclaves of the Sao Paulo elite. And businesses, especially banks, continue to earn profit margins almost unheard-of in other countries.
The only way out, these observers suggest, may be for Brazil to experience complete economic collapse--such as Argentina and Bolivia faced in the 1980s, before adopting successful anti-inflation austerity programmes--as a first, painful spur to effective action against inflation.
This is a dangerous, if alluring, argument. Jeffrey Sachs, a well-known Harvard economist, addressing the Fernand Braudel Institute of World Economics in Sao Paulo, recently likened it to ""letting your four-year-old child play in the middle of a busy street so that he can learn the rules of traffic"". Besides, while the cheerful ability of some Brazilians to adapt to inflation does indeed add to inflationary pressures, the basic reason inflation flourishes is that a comprehensive plan of orthodox reforms to counter it, though mooted in the past, has never actually been implemented.
Now would be a good time to start. The budget passed last month will leave a deficit of $10 billion this year. To fill that gap would be a first step. But how? Slashing expenditures would be harder than it sounds, because a large chunk of the budget goes to service the government's domestic debt, at grotesque real interest rates. Raising revenue would not be much easier, in a country where the informal economy is estimated at nearly a third of the official GDP and tax evasion is a national pastime. Both spending cuts and higher revenues are essential, however, if the government is to establish credibility and boost its fight against inflationary expectations.
But much more is needed. Mr Campos argues that monetary and fiscal austerity are not enough, because the burden of servicing the government's internal debt is so high. What is needed, he argues, is rapid privatisation of nearly all state companies. This would bring a double benefit. First, the proceeds, Mr Campos believes, would more than wipe out the nearly $40 billion of domestic debt held by the public. Second, with the ex-state firms under competent private management, the subsidies that currently keep most of them afloat would give way to tax revenues.
Another necessary reform is the creation of sources of long-term investment finance for businesses. The 1980s saw a precipitous decline in government investment, and most private capital is tied up in short-term speculation. Liberal economists have called for the privatisation of pensions, after the Chilean model, to free an enormous resource of now-trapped capital. If such an ambitious programme is combined with the continuation of tariff reductions and deregulation begun under Mr Collor, Brazil may yet begin to turn the corner.
Will Mr Franco make any headway on such reforms? In the four months--and three finance ministers--since he was sworn in as president, he has done little to disprove his detractors' view that he is a mediocre politician whose nationalistic and populist instincts cloud his ability to understand Brazil's economic woes. His fans, pointing to his new-found support for privatisation, say apologetically that he is learning the importance of liberalising as he goes along. Maybe, but while he muddles along in school, the nation's poorest are getting poorer still.
SELF-HELP IS THE BEST HELP
Ordinary Brazilians are not holding their breath. Marcio Moreira Alves, a political commentator, says that in states and municipalities across the land, citizens are joining with a new breed of local politician to provide for themselves the services that the bankrupt federal authorities and the crooked local ones do not. Increasingly, he says, they are using new ways, such as buying in from outside contractors, to get services such as education, school lunches and public health. In Ceara and Bahia, northeastern states long notorious for corruption, good government has become the new fashion. Tasso Jereissati, who cleaned house and set the finances straight when he was governor of Ceara, is today mentioned regularly as a dark horse for the presidency.
Herbert de Souza, a noted sociologist, sees businesses and wealthy individuals joining the effort. He observes that private charities, much less common in Brazil than in Western Europe or North America, have been springing up lately. Even the criminals are pitching in. It is well known that the mobsters behind Brazil's numbers racket sponsor the annual carnival celebrations; less known is the fact that a growing number of them now insist that the youths in their samba schools must also attend ordinary school classes.
In Rocinha, one of the many wretched shantytowns strung along Rio de Janeiro's breathtaking hills, open sewers and rancid litter line the streets. Disease, drugs and crime are the scourges of daily life here. Residents know that their government has failed them. But they have not given up hope. They have formed a neighbourhood association and work together on projects to make their slum life better. They have even organised themselves to provide a service that wealthy Americans can only dream of--affordable child care for the working mothers in their community.

 A good example is the restriction on foreign investment . Caving in to interest groups , the drafters of the document placed strict limits on foreign equity participation in many sectors . One result has been a drop in new investment in mining : at only $ 40 m in 1992 , this has fallen to a quarter of the 1988 level . Similar constraints have held up a much - needed pipeline from Bolivia to Brazil , which would provide energy - hungry Sao Paulo state with cheaper fuel . 
 Besides handcuffing the private sector , the constitution also enshrines the inefficient and overmanned state sector . The few half - hearted efforts made to trim the government payroll have been stymied by a guarantee of lifetime employment for long - serving public - sector employees . Efforts to reform the tax code or raise revenues have run foul of constitutional restrictions and require a special vote by congress . Such haggles tied up this year 's budget , which was formulated last August but approved only at the end of March . 
 Another constitutional folly is the over - representation in the legislature of states outside the populous south . This was insisted on by the generals , who felt their interests would be better served by politicians from the backward north - east and north . So Sao Paulo state has nearly a quarter of the country 's population , but barely a tenth of the seats in congress . Southerners are justifiably angry at the way their interests get short shrift . There is talk in the southernmost states , some of it serious , of secession . 
 The authors of the constitution , in their zeal to limit central power in the new democracy , also called for a dramatic shift of revenues to states and municipalities . The idea was that half the income of the federal government would be passed on to localities , which would then take over services such as health and education . The revenues have shifted . The responsibilities have not , partly because the federal bureaucracy has been unwilling to give up power . The result is that the federal government has to spend money it does not have -- so it borrows or simply prints the money instead . 
 State and local authorities , by contrast , are rolling in money -- not only from tax revenues , but from the central bank -- and the patronage that it makes possible . Though their responsibilities have not grown significantly , their payrolls have swollen from 8 % to 12 % of GDP in the past five years . 
 The inevitable result has been continued inflation . Add to this the economic folly of the constitution 's protection of government jobs and its barriers against foreign investment , and you can understand the lament of Roberto Campos , a leading economist and former finance minister : "" Our constitution is a miracle -- it is at once inflationary and recessionary . The stagflation we are now suffering from is constitutionally mandated . "" 
 BACK TO BASICS 
 There has been no shortage of heterodox shock plans promising to solve the nation 's economic woes , above all inflation . None has worked . A growing number of respectable economists and politicians now wonder whether any anti - inflation plan can work . Brazilians , they suggest , are too inured to high inflation , indeed have learned to profit handsomely from it . They talk of a parasitic "" culture of inflation "" , visible in the wealthy enclaves of the Sao Paulo elite . And businesses , especially banks , continue to earn profit margins almost unheard - of in other countries . 
 The only way out , these observers suggest , may be for Brazil to experience complete economic collapse -- such as Argentina and Bolivia faced in the 1980s , before adopting successful anti - inflation austerity programmes -- as a first , painful spur to effective action against inflation . 
 This is a dangerous , if alluring , argument . Jeffrey Sachs , a well - known Harvard economist , addressing the Fernand Braudel Institute of World Economics in Sao Paulo , recently likened it to "" letting your four - year - old child play in the middle of a busy street so that he can learn the rules of traffic "" . Besides , while the cheerful ability of some Brazilians to adapt to inflation does indeed add to inflationary pressures , the basic reason inflation flourishes is that a comprehensive plan of orthodox reforms to counter it , though mooted in the past , has never actually been implemented . 
 Now would be a good time to start . The budget passed last month will leave a deficit of $ 10 billion this year . To fill that gap would be a first step . But how ? Slashing expenditures would be harder than it sounds , because a large chunk of the budget goes to service the government 's domestic debt , at grotesque real interest rates . Raising revenue would not be much easier , in a country where the informal economy is estimated at nearly a third of the official GDP and tax evasion is a national pastime . Both spending cuts and higher revenues are essential , however , if the government is to establish credibility and boost its fight against inflationary expectations . 
 But much more is needed . Mr Campos argues that monetary and fiscal austerity are not enough , because the burden of servicing the government 's internal debt is so high . What is needed , he argues , is rapid privatisation of nearly all state companies . This would bring a double benefit . First , the proceeds , Mr Campos believes , would more than wipe out the nearly $ 40 billion of domestic debt held by the public . Second , with the ex - state firms under competent private management , the subsidies that currently keep most of them afloat would give way to tax revenues . 
 Another necessary reform is the creation of sources of long - term investment finance for businesses . The 1980s saw a precipitous decline in government investment , and most private capital is tied up in short - term speculation . Liberal economists have called for the privatisation of pensions , after the Chilean model , to free an enormous resource of now - trapped capital . If such an ambitious programme is combined with the continuation of tariff reductions and deregulation begun under Fernando Collor , Brazil may yet begin to turn the corner . 
 Will Mr Franco make any headway on such reforms ? In the four months -- and three finance ministers -- since he was sworn in as president , he has done little to disprove his detractors ' view that he is a mediocre politician whose nationalistic and populist instincts cloud his ability to understand Brazil 's economic woes . His fans , pointing to his new - found support for privatisation , say apologetically that he is learning the importance of liberalising as he goes along . Maybe , but while he muddles along in school , the nation 's poorest are getting poorer still . 
 SELF - HELP IS THE BEST HELP 
 Ordinary Brazilians are not holding their breath . Marcio Moreira Alves , a political commentator , says that in states and municipalities across the land , citizens are joining with a new breed of local politician to provide for themselves the services that the bankrupt federal authorities and the crooked local ones do not . Increasingly , he says , they are using new ways , such as buying in from outside contractors , to get services such as education , school lunches and public health . In Ceara and Bahia , northeastern states long notorious for corruption , good government has become the new fashion . Tasso Jereissati , who cleaned house and set the finances straight when he was governor of Ceara , is today mentioned regularly as a dark horse for the presidency . 
 Herbert de Souza , a noted sociologist , sees businesses and wealthy individuals joining the effort . He observes that private charities , much less common in Brazil than in Western Europe or North America , have been springing up lately . Even the criminals are pitching in . It is well known that the mobsters behind Brazil 's numbers racket sponsor the annual carnival celebrations ; less known is the fact that a growing number of them now insist that the youths in their samba schools must also attend ordinary school classes . 
 In Rocinha , one of the many wretched shantytowns strung along Rio de Janeiro 's breathtaking hills , open sewers and rancid litter line the streets . Disease , drugs and crime are the scourges of daily life here . Residents know that their government has failed them . But they have not given up hope . They have formed a neighbourhood association and work together on projects to make their slum life better . They have even organised themselves to provide a service that wealthy Americans can only dream of -- affordable child care for the working mothers in their community . If only the future of Brazil were in such people 's hands .",140,Brazil,A29-2047,POST TERM,True,"dashing young Fernando Collor , who promised a revolutionary modernisation of the economy",9,True

As if all that were not trouble enough, the landlord lets a goat loose in the flat. The goat, being a goat, wreaks havoc, and the tenant rows desperate. The landlord removes the goat. The flat reverts to its former state of disrepair. But everyone is happy.
On April 24th President Itamar Franco got rid of the goat by showing that he could, after all, take action. After seven idle months in office, with the roof collapsing over Brazil, he announced an ambitious economic recovery plan. His programme--a heady mix of big spending and big cutting--may not cure Brazil's inflation-fevered economy, slay the recession or win back the faith of foreign creditors. But the country's 150m neglected tenants heaved a sigh of relief.
Mr Franco had been branded as a distracted caretaker, doing little more than warming the presidential chair he inherited last October, when Fernando Collor was ousted in disgrace. Now, it seems, his government has begun. People in industry, banking, and the bourse applauded. The black-market dollar, Brazil's most nervous index, did not go through the roof.
Implementing the plan will be less ratifying. The promise is to achieve economic growth of over 39 this year while fighting everything from hunger and homelessness to tax dodgers and financial speculators. Cobbled together from 26 provisional decrees and executive orders, the economic-recovery programme is an ambitious inventory of investment and austerity. This ""list of good intentions"", as Delfim Netto, an economist, has called it, will cost $13.2 billion for agricultural credits and subsidies and $8.6 billion for nutrition and health care.
Treasury officials in Brasilia are still crunching numbers. Eliseu Resende, the finance minister, has said that the money will come from increased taxation, a more aggressive privatisation plan, and a crackdown on tax evaders. The government will also slash the budgets of state enterprises by a tenth. The bottom line, Mr Resende says, will be a one-third cut in the $40 billion public debt, and no operating deficit for this year. Inflation is supposed to tumble to 17 a month. That would be a scandal anywhere else on the planet, but it will be a blessing for Brazil, where the price rise in May is expected to be more than 30%.
Congress may balk at the spending list. Legislators have only just passed the 1993 budget, and they will not appreciate having to rearrange the billions in pork they packed into it. The greater problem is that while Mr Franco's plan is mathematically precise on spending, it is poetically vague on thrift.
Much of the expected boost in revenue is tied to a financial-transactions tax, which has yet towing final approval from Congress, and to fiscal reform, which is unlikely to be taken up until the constitutional revision due later this year. State companies, accustomed to cosy relations with government, will be loth to offer up their own 10X of flesh. The government, it seems, is counting heavily on getting money from tax dodgers. But an effective dragnet takes time-and in Brazil's case even loner since the tax-collecting department has been in shambles since Mr Collor's days.
There are other doubts about the plan. Mr Franco has often complained about the short-term speculation attracted by Brazil's high interest rates. He says he will cut interest rates on short-term investments to below inflation, thereby discouraging speculation. Exactly how he intends to do this, and how such an attempt will fit into his strategy to bring inflation under control, remain a mystery.
Yet the plan represents an important break with the past. After spending 17 years in Congress hurling broadsides at foreign creditors and defending state enterprises, Mr Franco has changed course. He intends not only to accelerate privatisation but also to reduce state control of ""strategic"" sectors, such as mining and telecommunications. Also encouraging has been his promise, albeit vague, to set up an independent central bank.
Two days after the plan was announced, Mr Resende took the newly minted package to creditors in Washington. Brazil's talks with the International Monetary Fund and a $2.1 billion standby loan were suspended last July when Mr Collor's government was self-destructing. The Fund may have difficulty swallowing the numbers in the new plan. But without the I M F'S imprimatur, the rescheduling of Brazil's $44 billion debt to private banks is in jeopardy.
It is a sign of the times that Mr Franco's plan is being praised more for what it did not do than what it did. Brazilians have become only too accustomed to economic pyrotechnics and were fearful of more. In the past decade they have suffered through five price and wage freezes, 11 stabilisation plans, three debt moratoriums and seven letters of intent with the IMF. ""The Brazilian economy is an economy of frights, and mercifully this plan brought no new frights,"" said Roberto Campos, a former finance minister who has seen it all.","People in Brazil tell the story of the beleaguered tenant who complains eternally about leaky rafters , broken plumbing , short circuits , and the like .

When he became president of Venezuela in 1989, he inherited a bankrupt country. Venezuela's petro-economy had been knocked into stagflation by falling oil prices and by his predecessors' free-spending ways. He courageously liberalised the economy, with both painful and fruitful results. Now he has stepped aside, accused of corruption--much as Fernando Collor, another economic liberaliser, had to step aside before being driven out of office in Brazil last year. A coincidence? Or are there special perils for reforming presidents in Latin America?
Mr Perez was unpopular long before the current corruption charges were made. Though Venezuela is traditionally considered Latin America's most secure democracy, soldiers tried not once but twice last year to force him out of office. And the nation cheered when the Supreme Court and the Senate voted last week to impeach him. Whether or not he is convicted, most Venezuelans already consider him guilty. Their certainty owes something to a sense of betrayal. Venezuelans elected Mr Perez in 1988 with fond memories of his first presidency in the 1970s, a golden era to which he promised a return. His about-face once in office pleased economists, but robbed him of his mandate: the voters no longer believed he was the man they had elected. They have dismissed even the manifest economic growth generated by his policies, certain that any wealth created must have gone straight into his or his cronies' pockets.
All of this must seem familiar to Brazil's ex-President Collor, another economic reformer, also forced out on corruption charges. Mr Collor breezed into office, beguiling the voters with his good looks and grand talk of clean government. But his party had neither a national nor an ideological base, and was used by the president merely as a vehicle for his political advancement. As his corruption became evident, usually tolerant Brazilians flooded on to the streets and drove him out.
The downfall of Mr Perez and Mr Collor may in fact owe less to their corruption--real or imagined--than to their general unpopularity and especially that of their economic reforms. Other Latin American presidents have been able to bring in economic change without the encumbrances of democratic politics. Augusto Pinochet, for instance, liberalised the Chilean economy unhindered by squeals of pain because these were muffled by his dictatorship. When the grumbling grew too loud for Alberto Fujimori in Peru, he simply shut down democratic politics. It is tempting to think that economic reform in Latin America is incompatible with democracy.
It is not. Argentina and Bolivia have shown that presidents do not have to be dictators to be reformers. These two countries may, however, be special in another way: both had suffered hyperinflation that had shattered not only their economies but also their political oppositions. The new presidents therefore had a relatively free hand to implement reforms. So maybe the proposition merely needs adjustment: reform is possible in Latin America only when the force of might, or the horror of economic chaos, numbs the populace into acceptance.
ANOTHER WAY IN MEXICO
Fortunately, the success achieved by Carlos Salinas in Mexico suggests an alternative. He has managed to remain popular and reformist--despite criticism from a vocal, if not powerful, opposition--by getting ordinary people involved. His Solidarity scheme, based on help for those who help themselves, has provided schools and sewers for those who might otherwise have waited years for benefits to trickle down.
Critics say such efforts are just for show. Public relations is certainly part of their purpose. Yet they have helped persuade a suspicious population to accept Mr Salinas's much-needed reforms. As Mr Perez will attest, that is no small accomplishment.","The tale of Carlos Andres Perez contains a caution . When he became president of Venezuela in 1989 , he inherited a bankrupt country .

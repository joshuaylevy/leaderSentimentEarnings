Not that he was worried about his career. Rather, Mr Staribacher had been working hard on the government's sale of its 48.6% stake in Creditanstalt, Austria's second-largest bank. And the frustration of failing to close a deal had finally taken its toll on him. 
No wonder. On and off, Austria's politicians have been trying to sell that stake (which represents 70% of the bank's voting rights) since 199o. But so far, Creditanstalt has yet to find a suitable banking partner. Now, a new coupling is being proposed. Will it succeed? 
Creditanstalt has had no shortage of eager suitors, but none has yet whisked it off its feet. In May 1994 Switzerland's cs Holding (which owns, among other things, Credit Suisse, a big Swiss bank) began wooing it, but was rebuffed for not being Austrian. Last year, a consortium involving First Austrian Bank, the country's biggest savings bank; EA Generali, the Austrian arm of Generali, an Italian insurer; Banca Commerciale Italiana (scI); and Germany's Commerzbank bid for a sizeable minority stake in the bank. But this failed too, partly because the government's asking price was too high and because the deal would not have ensured that the bank remained under Austrian control. 
Now the consortium's advisers have come up with an ingenious new plan. According to this, as long as the private foundation that controls First Austrian agrees to the proposal, it will set up a new holding company to absorb both its own shares and the governments stake in Creditanstalt, which will be bought by the consortium. Creditanstalt's 30,ooo other shareholders may also be invited to swap their stakes for shares in the holding company. This new company would therefore be controlled by the foundation and the other members of First Austrian's consortium, which also include some Austrian industrial firms. Eventually, a sizeable minority stake in the company may be sold to the public. 
Neither Creditanstalt nor the Austrian finance ministry will comment publicly on the deal. But the new finance minister, Viktor Klima, is thought to favour it. For one thing, First Austrian's foundation will probably end up owning about one-third of the holding company and, together with the consortium's other Austrian members, will help ensure that Creditanstalt retains its Austrian roots. The government also badly needs the cash from a sale. Mr Klima has pencilled proceeds from the disposal into his budget this year. 
The majority of Creditanstalt's managing board (though not, apparently, its chairman, Guido Schmidt-Chiari) is enthusiastic too. Because the deal is not a full-blown merger, the bank will keep much of its independence. Strategy for the group will be set at holding-company level, but underneath this there will be two separate managing boards, one for First Austrian and another for Creditanstalt. 
But does the deal make good business sense? Certainly, there are plenty of potential synergies for the two banks to explore. While Creditanstalt is strong in, say, institutional fund management in Austria, First Austrian is a force to be reckoned with on the retail side. Both banks could also cut costs by consolidating their treasury operations. And while Commerzbank and BCI could benefit from Creditanstalt's extensive know-how in Eastern Europe, the Austrian bank could use its new allies to build its strength in Western Europe. 
Managing such a complex beast may prove tricky, however. Alliances of equals in banking, no matter how well-intentioned, often lead to bitter infighting later on. And the real job ahead is to consolidate Austria's overcrowded banking sector. That means tough decisions-closing branches and sacking staff-which a single management team might be better placed to make. If the proposed two-headed giant can muster the will to make such cuts, all well and good. If it cannot, the ""Austrian solution"" may not be a solution at all.

The new chancellor, at 49, is ten years younger than his predecessor. But will he really make a difference? 
Perhaps. Though Mr Vranitzky, slightly against the odds, won a general election at the end of 1995, he has been looking jaded. In October, his Social Democrats did badly in Austria's first elections to the European Parliament: the mainstream conservative People's Party, with which the Social Democrats have been running Austria in a ""redblack"" coalition, beat them by a whisker. Even more shockingly for Austria's consensus-minded majority, Jorg Haider's postfascist Freedom Movement, with 28%, had its best result ever, coming only a bare percentage point behind. And it beat the conservatives into second place in elections on the same day for Vienna's city council. 
Mr Klima's edge over Mr Vranitzky is that he promises to be tougher, more energetic and more decisive. He may also be more charming and more clever. At a time when the government's policy is largely aimed at getting Austria into Europe's monetary union in the first wave in 1999, he is better versed in economics. He has recently presided over a ruthless budget. Moreover, his stock among Social Democrats has gone up because, after months of wrangling, he has overseen the purchase by Bank Austria, which has tight links with the Social Democrats, of the ailing Creditanstalt, the second-biggest bank and an old conservative stronghold. Though the eventual deal smacked-as usual in Austria-of compromise and carve-up, Mr Klima may be generally keener than Mr Vranitzky was to be open, to deregulate, to privatise. 
Mr Klima may also be better at countering the populist challenge of Mr Haider, whose party made big inroads among bluecollar workers who had previously voted for the Social Democrats. Mr Vranitzky has studiously ignored Mr Haider. Mr Klima may more straightforwardly take him on. It is conceivable, too, that the new man will leave open the possibility of making deals with Mr Haider rather than seeking always to cold-shoulder him. 
But the biggest long-term question facing Austria-and Mr Klima-is whether to perpetuate the old system of Proporz, whereby the nation's business and politics, down to the humblest level, are stitched up between the two main parties. Mr Haider has won votes through his opposition to immigration and the European Union (which Austria joined in 1995). But his attacks on the old political establishment for its love of the corrupting and suffocating Proporz may have won him even more support. If Mr Klima can start breaking down the old ways and inject a dose of rawer competition into politics and business, he would indeed be a sharp improvement on dull, worthy Mr Vranitzky.

Behind the scenes, so has jockeying among candidates-and bargaining among the European Union's leaders, who will make the choice. They are likely to discuss it at their summit in Cardiff this weekend. 
The Eu's record in choosing candidates for top jobs is lamentable, not least because names must be approved unanimously. The May summit that launched the euro will for ever be remembered for its 12-hour argument over the presidency of the European Central Bank, resolved only by the messy compromise whereby the Dutch candidate, Wim Duisenberg, agreed to step down ""voluntarily"" after four years to make way for a Frenchman, JeanClaude Trichet. 
The choosing of the commission's president has proved equally unedifying. Four years ago Germany's Helmut Kohl and France's Francois Mitterrand tried to foist the Belgian prime minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene, on their colleagues. But the British prime minister, John Major, vetoed Mr Dehaene A crisis summit then gave the job to Jacques Santer, the unassuming prime minister of Luxembourg, who had never been in the running. The commission under Mr Santer has not done badly: the single currency will arrive on time, talks on bringing in new members from the east have begun. But, though Europe's leaders mistrust the commission's power, they want its president to be something more than the glorified civil servant Mr Santer has proved to be. 
So the pendulum may swing back towards someone in the mould of Jacques Delors, the president from 1985 to 1994. He was controversial, particularly with the British, chiefly because he was so effective. Though the next president will not be allowed any new initiatives as grand as the single market and the single currency, the job has since gained in significance in two ways. One is that the EU, unloved by so many Europeans, badly needs some new direction. The other is that the Amsterdam treaty has given the commission's president enhanced powers over his colleagues, including the right to block their appointment. 
So who will inherit the mantle? Nationality counts, as does politics. After Mr Delors, a French Socialist, Buggins's turn gave the job to someone from a small country and the political righthence Mr Santer. It ought now to go to a big country, and the political left France and Britain are, however, probably excluded: the first because it had Mr Delors, and because it made such a fuss over the central bank, and the second because it has become an unwritten rule in Brussels that only a country in the single currency can supply the commission's president. 
That leaves one clear front-runner: Felipe Gonzalez. When the job came up in 1994, Mr Gonzalez, then Spain's prime minister, was pressed by Mr Kohl to take it. He declined because he wanted to fight the 1996 election. But now, with the Spanish Socialist Party having slighted him by rejecting his chosen candidate to lead it into the next election, there is nothing left for him at home. And though he says he is not interested in running the commission, rumour says he might change his mind. He has revelled in his recent role as Europe's special envoy for Kosovo, though he has yet to make a dent in the latest Balkan crisis. 
Mr Gonzalez, who at 56 is too young to retire, has obstacles to overcome. One is the trial that has just begun in Madrid of his former interior minister and other senior officials, who are said to have run anti-terrorist death-squads in the 198os. Some defendants have told the court that Mr Gonzalez at least tacitly condoned their actions. A second problem is Mr Gonzalez's bad relations with his successor as Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, who might be reluctant to nominate him. The likely departure this autumn of Chancellor Kohl will also not help the Gonzalez cause. 
Nor will lack of enthusiasm from Britain's Tony Blair. Mr Gonzalez is more old Labour than new. And he is a bit too much like Mr Delors. He praises Jean Monnet's dream of Europe proceeding via tariff union through monetary union to political union, and says European leaders should make this a reality. 
If not Mr Gonzalez, who else? Ireland's former commissioner, Peter Sutherland, has his supporters in Brussels, but few are political heavyweights Austria's chancellor, Viktor Klima, has recently been touted. But Italy, which has not supplied a president since 1972, has a stronger claim than either. One former Italian prime minister, Giuliano Amato, has made his interest clear. But he is not well known. And, although he has been unscathed by Italy's political scandals, his association with the disgraced Bettino Craxi may not be forgotten. Efforts have been made to interest the present Italian prime minister, Romano Prodi. But he may prefer to lead in Rome-if his ""Olive Tree"" coalition will hold together-than to serve in Brussels. 
Germany has not had a commission president since Walter Hallstein, the first ever, left in 1967. Its problem has always been a lack of obvious candidates. Some in the Social Democratic Party, assuming that Gerhard Schroder will be chancellor after September, have talked of the job going to Monika Wulff-Matthies, the present commissioner for regional affairs. But heads of government do not usually like to choose from the present commission; they prefer to give the job to one of their circle In Bonn there has also been talk of Theo Waigel, Germany's long-serving finance minister, going to Brussels, though he is right-wing. And what of Mr Kohl himself? It is hard to imagine him taking orders from freshman chancellors and prime ministers. 
Bookmaking Eurocrats make Mr Gonzalez the favourite, with Mr Amato trailing and Mr Prodi and Mr Sutherland longer shots. But,judging by 1994, dark horses could move into contention. One could be the darkest of them all, Mr Santer himself ","IT IS the pinnacle of Euro-power, so perhaps it is not surprising that speculation has already begun about who will be chosen next year to be president of the European Commission from 2000 to 2004.

He praises Jean Monnet's dream of Europe proceeding via tariff union through monetary union to political union, and says European leaders should make this a reality. 
If not Mr Gonzalez, who else? Ireland's former commissioner, Peter Sutherland, has his supporters in Brussels, but few are political heavyweights Austria's chancellor, Viktor Klima, has recently been touted. But Italy, which has not supplied a president since 1972, has a stronger claim than either. One former Italian prime minister, Giuliano Amato, has made his interest clear. But he is not well known. And, although he has been unscathed by Italy's political scandals, his association with the disgraced Bettino Craxi may not be forgotten. Efforts have been made to interest the present Italian prime minister, Romano Prodi. But he may prefer to lead in Rome-if his ""Olive Tree"" coalition will hold together-than to serve in Brussels. 
Germany has not had a commission president since Walter Hallstein, the first ever, left in 1967. Its problem has always been a lack of obvious candidates. Some in the Social Democratic Party, assuming that Gerhard Schroder will be chancellor after September, have talked of the job going to Monika Wulff-Matthies, the present commissioner for regional affairs. But heads of government do not usually like to choose from the present commission; they prefer to give the job to one of their circle In Bonn there has also been talk of Theo Waigel, Germany's long-serving finance minister, going to Brussels, though he is right-wing. And what of Mr Kohl himself? It is hard to imagine him taking orders from freshman chancellors and prime ministers. 
Bookmaking Eurocrats make Mr Gonzalez the favourite, with Mr Amato trailing and Mr Prodi and Mr Sutherland longer shots. But,judging by 1994, dark horses could move into contention. One could be the darkest of them all, Mr Santer himself ",305,Austria,A29-4510,,False,,0,True

Until June 23rd, when European Union officials started raiding the country's main banks, it certainly looked that way. Gerhard Praschak, head of Kontrollbank, the main exportcredit provider, shot himself on April 28th last year in protest at political cronyism in the banking system. His six-page suicide note described how he had been bullied into accepting a former Social Democrat politician, Rudolf Scholten, on to the bank's board. It also alleged that Austria's banking system was infested with price-fixing and sleaze. 
Nothing much happened. Mr Scholten got his job. No one resigned. Questions in parliament were brushed aside; Mr Praschak, it was said, had been depressed. The Austrian chancellor, Viktor Klima, announced solemnly that in future all jobs in the state's gift would be allocated ""strictly on merit"" (thus tacitly admitting that past practice had been different). Few believed him-and the disbelievers included officials in the European Union's competition directorate, who had been observing Austria's incestuous, state-dominated financial system with increasing disapproval. This week, on the strength of Mr Praschak's suicide note and leaked handwritten notes of what appears to have been a price-fixing meeting attended by senior bankers in May last year, a dozen EU investigators paid surprise visits to the offices of Austria's top seven banks in search of misbehaviour. 
The raid, one of the most politically sensitive ever mounted by the competition directorate, came one week before Austria was due to take over the European Union presidency, and highlights an aspect of the country which its ruling elite wisely prefers to be kept out of international gaze. The two main parties, the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, as ideologically indistinguishable as Coke and Pepsi, have had both the political landscape and the economy stitched up between them for the past 50 years. Austrian politicians are severely miffed at having these arrangements exposed to public view. 
But is there a cartel? Austria's heavily over-branched and over-banked domestic market certainly offers poor service at high cost. A few years ago an employees' association successfully took the banks before the local anti-cartel authorities for fixing the level of some account charges. But domestic retail banking makes little money nowadays. Austrian banks' lucrative business is done abroad, especially in the growing markets of central Europe. 
That does not rule out a cartel, however. Austria's top bankers would have reason to collude to keep losses down in businesses that politicians and trade unions will not let them abandon. The price-fixing, of fees and interest rates, allegedly took place at the meetings of the ""Lombard Club"", an informal (by Austrian standards, at least) monthly lunch in Vienna's Hotel Bristol. All the main banks, including Kontrollbank, Creditanstalt, Bank Austria, and the postal savings bank attended, as did the central bank. 
Officially, the Lombard Club is an innocent talking shop, where bankers swap ideas about the introduction of the euro or the smooth functioning of the money market. No minutes are taken, bank officials claim; there is no secretary; and the bill is picked up by the participants in rotation. If the EU'S competition authorities can prove otherwise, the consequences will be interesting. Fines on cartel participants can be as much as lo% of annual turnover. Senior bankers would come under enormous pressure to resign, and Austria's cosy little financial world might never be the same again. Just as Mr Praschak hoped, before he pulled the trigger.

THEIR grins were broad, their self-satisfaction undisguised. When European Union leaders met in Portschach, in Austria, on October 24th and 25th, it was as good as a congregation of the faithful. The left now controls or shares power in 13 of the Eu's 15 governments-all bar Spain and Ireland. These were leaders of a creed on the ascendancy, glowing with the thrill of their success, among friends, and loving it. And, with the absence of the stern gaze of Helmut Kohl, Germany's outgoing chancellor, who turned up only to collect an award, they were uninhibited at last. Summing up the leaders' views, Austria's Chancellor Viktor Klima, the summit's host, declared: ""There are good conditions for low interest rates in the euro zone. Stable prices, growth and employment are not contradictory."" 
With the Eu's unemployment rate at lo%, an alarming i6.8m people, more than the entire population of the Netherlands, are out of work. So jobs, they said, should be at the centre of Europe's concerns. Across the border in Germany, at a Social Democratic Party congress, some voices went even further. ""I don't believe in the sole saintly wisdom of the Bundesbank,"" declared Oskar Lafontaine, Germany's powerful new finance minister, loftily. Central banks, he said, should give the same importance to jobs as they do to price stability. His boss, Gerhard Schroder, dropped in on the EU summit, though he was not sworn in as chancellor until two days later. 
The left's weekend love-in must have sent a frisson down Mr Kohl's spine, not to mention that of Tony Blair, Britain's Labour prime minister, who stands decidedly to the right of his continental colleagues. What seemed to be emerging was a new European consensus on economic policy, which centred on the need to create jobs-at the expense, if necessary, of inflation and fiscal rigour. Governments, argued some of them, have been tightening their belts quite enough in recent years in an effort to meet the criteria to qualify for the euro, which will be launched in January. This has been painful, and has prevented governments spending money on job-creation, such as infrastructure programmes. Now, their currencies safely squeezed into the euro, they can afford to relax a little. 
Had these calls come only from a handful of smaller European countries, they might not have mattered much. The reason for the attention, however, is that for the first time in years, the governments of the euro-zone's two big powers, France and Germany, led by Lionel Jospin (and President Jacques Chirac) and Mr Schroder, are in tune. More than that, the two men with their hands on the economy, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's finance minister, and Mr Lafontaine, think alike. Both believe, for example, in a political counterweight to the new European Central Bank (EcB and eliminating unfair tax competition. And fluent in the other's language, they are good friends to boot. 
Does this mean then that,just weeks before the launch of the euro, European governments are threatening the independence of the Ecs? Maybe not. There is nothing new about French pleas for lower interest rates-nor, for that matter, about similar German pleas, which were common under Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in the early 198os. French governments often annoy the French central bank with such demands; it, in turn, tells them to stop poking their noses into its business. There may be no harm in such exchanges. Indeed, paradoxically, the firmer a central bank's independence, the louder the political cries are likely to be to try to influence it. 
When pushed, even Mr Lafontaine does not argue against the independence of the ECB, just that there should be a Europewide political body to give it advice-which it could then ignore. And ignore it it will, if the record ofthe Bundesbank, on which the ECB is modelled, is anything to go by. Part, if only part, of the French argument for a political counterweight is to make the ECB more accountable and open to ordinary citizens, not to boss the bank about. 
That said, while he may not say so in as many words, another of Mr Lafontaine's proposals would collide with the ECB'S constitutional job of keeping prices stable. This is the idea of setting ""corridors"" for the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar and the yen, partly to prevent the euro becoming so strong that it put jobs in export-oriented industries at risk. Were they ever introduced, such corridors, set by politicians, could undermine the ECB'S efforts to maintain price stability. 
And what of the hard-won fiscal discipline that has allowed the euro's birth in the first place? Were EU leaders not also trying to wriggle out of this in Portschach? Just as there were rules governing fiscal policy in countries that wanted to join the euro, so there are rules-known as the ""stability pact""-to ensure good housekeeping once inside. Should any government overshoot the 3% limit set for a budget deficit, for instance, and fail to rein it back in after a caution, other EU members can in theory punish that government with a fine. 
These rules themselves may be overstrict. In times of recession, governments need to loosen fiscal policy. But, as long as economies are growing nicely-GDP in the EU is expected to grow by 2.4% in 999-the rules exist to keep governments in line. The trouble is that, in theory at least, if several governments were to run bigger deficits, they could each decide not to punish the other. Among left-leaning friends, the idea that they would be embarrassed into keeping fiscal policy tight looks less than convincing. One reason Mr Lafontaine is so excited by the idea of shifting job-creating infrastructure projects to Brussels may be that this would safely extract the spending from Germany's books. 
More to the point, if Europe's governments decided to try to curb unemployment by spending more, they would bump up against the ECB's efforts to keep monetary policy tight. As in the United States in the 198os, this could lead to a strong currency, which would damage exports; high interest rates might also dampen growth. Nor could governments anyway be confident of doing much to create jobs. Most of Europe's unemployment is ""structural"": it does not fall even when the economy booms. Demand-stimulated growth might create jobs at the margin. But the underlying problem of European unemployment lies elsewhere: in social protection, inflexible wages and the prohibitive cost to employers of hiring in the first place.

Dark rumours swirled round Prague, the Czech capital, that Mr Zilk had informed for communist Czecho slovakia's secret police. Czech resisters had been jailed on his clandestine evidence, it was said. 
Mr Zilk, whose hand was damaged by a letter bomb sent by Austrian neo-fascists five years ago, said the charge was absolutely groundless. Austria's Chancellor Viktor Klima backed him unequivocally. Czech politicians, including a former prime minister, Vaclav Klaus, complained that President Havel had damaged relations with a friendly neighbour. Ministers reviewed the secret police files, and declared that the case against Mr Zilk was indeed unproven. President Havel, it seemed, had gone astray. 
In a final twist, the president's aides let it be known that Mr Havel had been duped into branding Mr Zilk a collaborator. They said that proof of Mr Zilk's ""treachery"" came from a senator from Mr Klaus's party, a staunch rival to Mr Havel's lot.

But this is unlikely, as long as Mr Havel's health holds up; he has suffered a succession of serious illnesses over the past couple of years.

On Monday alone Viktor Klima was in Paris and The Hague, wrapping up a two-week tour of EU capitals and preparing the way for a summit this weekend in his country's own capital, Vienna. It was his second such helter-skelter in the space of three months. 
A diplomat who saw Mr Klima this week said he looked tired, but was still smiling. As well he might be: the head of government tends to enjoy an EU presidency. The prestige usually gives him a boost in the opinion polls at home. It keeps his name in the newspapers. And the main work-load falls on him only when a summit comes round, which is once or perhaps twice on his watch. For everybody else in the government concerned, an EU presidency means a great deal more business than pleasure. 
It is a daunting job even when a big country takes it on. The country holding the presidency chairs dozens of ministerial councils and literally hundreds of lesser committees. It speaks for the EU in external affairs. It sets the policy agenda as best it can. And it does all this while trying to carry on its ordinary job back home. For a small or disorganised country, a bad presidency can turn into a public debacle. Italy fumed for months when a diplomat compared its performance in 199o to ""a coach trip with the Marx Brothers in the driving seat"". 
The Austrians' debut, in contrast, has been a study in seriousness. A small country by Eu standards and a member only since 1995, Austria foresaw the need to prepare well. It arranged role-playing games in Vienna, at which civil servants could practise the handling not only of council and committee meetings, but of working lunches and coffee breaks as well. 
In the event, that has not stopped diplomats in Brussels carping about Austria's inexperience. They say that meetings have gone on too long, quick fixes have been missed, agendas have been changed too late and too often. There was a sharp rise in grumbling this month as the final business of the presidency was being whipped through the councils, and national representatives found themselves trapped at table for 12 and 13 hours at a stretch. 
But the Austrians deserve praise too. Coming after the British, and with Germany next due to hold the post, they were handed a lot of unrewarding work in progress. The German election in September caused huge distractions. But the Austrians hacked doggedly away at the thickest of their dossiers, ""Agenda zooo"", a sprawling blueprint of medium-term financial reforms designed by the European Commission. In October they hosted a highly successful ""informal"" summit for EU leaders at Portschach, a resort in southern Austria. Last week they delighted their home audience by concluding a long-awaited Eu agreement involving Switzerland on Alpine lorry traffic, which should ease pressure on the Brenner Pass between Austria and Italy. And this week they helped broker a compromise on the EU'S 1999 budget, ending a traditional struggle between parliament and member countries. 
The trick for Mr Klima now will be to seize the limelight, chair a good-humoured summit, and so end the presidency on a high note. He can but hope. No amount of preparation ever seems quite to determine how these things go. Even without some last-minute quarrel or crisis, leaders rarely manage to stick to the script. The informal summit in October was billed as a tedious-sounding session on ""subsidiarity"", but turned into a surprisingly jolly affair when the assembled leaders talked instead about whatever took their fancy. 
On his latest whistle-stop tour, Mr Klima seems to have found other leaders agreed mainly on the need to put lots of uplifting waffle about employment policy high on the Vienna agenda. France and Germany said this week they wanted ""binding and verifiable targets"" for job creation. Another message was that nobody much wants to talk about speeding up EU ""enlargement"" to bring in countries from Central and Eastern Europe. That loss of enthusiasm will come as something of a relief to Mr Klima, even though his own government pushed successfully for negotiations with a first group of applicants to begin last month. Setting an early date for actual admissions would upset a lot of Austrians, who fear an influx of migrant labour. 
The summits mood may darken if the vexed questions of EU tax barmonisation and majority voting (ie, no national vetoes) are given much of an airing. Britain and Germany were trying to resolve differences this week before the summit began. 
But the most likely cause of dissent will be Agenda 2000, and the EU budget in general: France and Germany said jointly this week that they supported a medium-term freeze on EU budgetary spending. The real discord here is over national contributions. Germany is resolved to pay less into the Eu budget. Nobody else, especially Britain, wants to pay more. France opposes cuts in farm spending. And Spain leads ferocious opposition from poorer countries to almost any cuts in spending at all. A row to resolve these contradictions must come sooner or later, if not in Vienna then probably under Germany's presidency in the first half of next year. 
And if all does go smoothly in Vienna, spare a thought for Wolfgang Schussel, Austria's foreign minister and vice-chancellor. He leads the conservative People's Party, the junior partner with Mr Klima's Social Democrat Party in a coalition government. Mr Schussel has done most of the work managing the EU presidency. Mr Klima has taken the most of the credit. That is no small matter when a general election falls due next year. So if you see Mr Schussel with his trade-mark bow-tie looking tired but smiling this weekend, that may be because he knows Austria's next turn at the presidency will come in 20o6-at the earliest. ","IF HEADS of government are allowed to keep their air - miles Viktor Klima's will have quite a nest - egg from Viktor Klima's country 's six - month presidency of the European Union . On Monday alone Viktor Klima was in Paris and The Hague , wrapping up a two - week tour of EU capitals and preparing the way for a summit this weekend in Viktor Klima's country 's own capital , Vienna . It was Viktor Klima's second such helter - skelter in the space of three months . 
 A diplomat who saw Viktor Klima this week said Viktor Klima looked tired , but was still smiling . As well Viktor Klima might be : the head of government tends to enjoy an EU presidency . The prestige usually gives him a boost in the opinion polls at home . It keeps his name in the newspapers . And the main work - load falls on him only when a summit comes round , which is once or perhaps twice on his watch . For everybody else in the government concerned , an EU presidency means a great deal more business than pleasure . 
 It is a daunting job even when a big country takes it on . The country holding the presidency chairs dozens of ministerial councils and literally hundreds of lesser committees . It speaks for the EU in external affairs . It sets the policy agenda as best it can . And it does all this while trying to carry on its ordinary job back home . For a small or disorganised country , a bad presidency can turn into a public debacle . Italy fumed for months when a diplomat compared its performance in 199o to "" a coach trip with the Marx Brothers in the driving seat "" . 
 The Austrians ' debut , in contrast , has been a study in seriousness . A small country by Eu standards and a member only since 1995 , Austria foresaw the need to prepare well . It arranged role - playing games in Vienna , at which civil servants could practise the handling not only of council and committee meetings , but of working lunches and coffee breaks as well . 
 In the event , that has not stopped diplomats in Brussels carping about Austria 's inexperience . They say that meetings have gone on too long , quick fixes have been missed , agendas have been changed too late and too often . There was a sharp rise in grumbling this month as the final business of the presidency was being whipped through the councils , and national representatives found themselves trapped at table for 12 and 13 hours at a stretch . 
 But the Austrians deserve praise too . Coming after the British , and with Germany next due to hold the post , they were handed a lot of unrewarding work in progress . The German election in September caused huge distractions . But the Austrians hacked doggedly away at the thickest of their dossiers , "" Agenda zooo "" , a sprawling blueprint of medium - term financial reforms designed by the European Commission . In October they hosted a highly successful "" informal "" summit for EU leaders at Portschach , a resort in southern Austria . Last week they delighted their home audience by concluding a long - awaited Eu agreement involving Switzerland on Alpine lorry traffic , which should ease pressure on the Brenner Pass between Austria and Italy . And this week they helped broker a compromise on the EU 'S 1999 budget , ending a traditional struggle between parliament and member countries . 
 The trick for Viktor Klima now will be to seize the limelight , chair a good - humoured summit , and so end the presidency on a high note . Viktor Klima can but hope . No amount of preparation ever seems quite to determine how these things go . Even without some last - minute quarrel or crisis , leaders rarely manage to stick to the script . The informal summit in October was billed as a tedious - sounding session on "" subsidiarity "" , but turned into a surprisingly jolly affair when the assembled leaders talked instead about whatever took their fancy . 
 On Viktor Klima's latest whistle - stop tour , Viktor Klima seems to have found other leaders agreed mainly on the need to put lots of uplifting waffle about employment policy high on the Vienna agenda . France and Germany said this week they wanted "" binding and verifiable targets "" for job creation . Another message was that nobody much wants to talk about speeding up EU "" enlargement "" to bring in countries from Central and Eastern Europe . That loss of enthusiasm will come as something of a relief to Viktor Klima , even though Viktor Klima's own government pushed successfully for negotiations with a first group of applicants to begin last month . Setting an early date for actual admissions would upset a lot of Austrians , who fear an influx of migrant labour . 
 The summits mood may darken if the vexed questions of EU tax barmonisation and majority voting ( ie , no national vetoes ) are given much of an airing . Britain and Germany were trying to resolve differences this week before the summit began .

Frits Bolkestein, a leading Dutch politician, begs to differ. More liberal reforms are needed, he argues-everywhere in Europe 
IN JUNE 1997 President Bill Clinton lauded the Dutch model of economic policy as a ""success story"". It deserved imitation, he said. Economic editors of most international newspapers also praised the economic performance in the polder behind the dykes. They wrote about ""The third way"" (New York Times), our ""sturdy neighbour"" (Wirtschaftswoche) or a ""Dutch cure"" (Die Zeit). This newspaper called it ""Dutch delight"". 
Such favourable comments refer to the above-average economic growth (compared with other member states of the European Union), the increase in employment, the low rate of inflation and the reduction of the budget deficit. According to these foreign commentators, this economic performance stems from a number of characteristics typical of the Dutch economic order. It has even been given a name: the poldermodel. But opinions differ on what that concept means. This article attempts to explain such ambiguity, and explore its consequences. 
To do that, it needs to answer the following questions: (1) Which variants of capitalism exist? (2) What are the characteristics of the Dutch economy? (3) How successful is that economy in fact? (4) What more should be done? 
Of models and capitalisms 
In his well-known book ""Capitalisme contre capitalisme"", a former director of the French planning agency, Michel Albert, made the following distinction. On the one hand, he said, there is a continental, West European type of capitalism (the ""Rhineland"" model); on the other an Anglo-Saxon capitalism (in Great Britain and the United States of America). 
The Rhineland model may be seen as a regulated market economy with a comprehensive system of social security. Government, employers' organisations and labour unions consult each other about economic goals and on the policy instruments to be used. In the Rhineland, therefore, the welfare state is combined with a so-called ""consultation economy"". 
Rhineland participants in the economic process (widely known as ""stakeholders"") try to achieve a harmony of interests. In such a stakeholder economy the primary goal, it is said, is not the maximisation of short-term profits for the benefit of the shareholders. The main concern is a sustainable, stable and continuous economic growth. 
In contrast to the stakeholder economy there is the American or Anglo-Saxon ""shareholder economy"". Under the American form of capitalism, private enterprise is about maximising short-term profits for those who invest. It is less regulated than in the Rhineland. Its focus is said to be not on any harmony of interests, but on competition and if necessary confrontation. In going for profits, Americans are more willing to take risks. Where Europeans may be riskavoiders, Americans are risk-lovers. Under the Anglo-Saxon type of capitalism individual responsibility plays a more important role than in the Rhineland, with its organised care and solidarity. In the Netherlands, the Social and Economic Council (an advisory semi-corporatist council for social and economic affairs) and the Labour Foundation (a council for employers' organisations and unions) have fulfilled important functions. Employers' organisations and unions are called ""social partners"". 
Many in the Netherlands attribute their success to harmonious relations between these social partners. They appear to think that this is what the poldermodel boils down to, both in the past and in its recently modified form (of which, more later). The previous minister of social affairs-a social democrat-said ""Ich bin ein Rheinlander."" Certainly such good relations play a role. But it is other factors which have caused the poldermodel's recent success. 
In the view of Wim Duisenberg, a Dutchman who is now president of the European Central Bank, the success of the Dutch economy stems from: an improvement in state finances; a pruning of the system of social security; a more flexible labour market; and a stable exchange rate between the Dutch guilder and the German mark. 
It has been claimed that the so-called Wassenaar Agreement of 1982 has made Dutch success possible. At Wassenaar, a suburb of The Hague, employers' organisations and unions reached an agreement on wage modernisation and the creation of jobs. But this agreement in fact led to an erosion of the Rhineland model. It brought centralised wage bargaining to an end and led to a release of market forces. Decentralisation was a move away from the consultation economy and towards the market. 
Tax cuts played an important part in wage moderation. They increased people's purchasing power and thus made it possible to limit increases in wages. Wage moderation has therefore not led to a shortfall in demand, as originally feared by some. The tax cuts coincided with a decrease of the budget deficit as a percentage of national income. Both were made possible by a sizeable reduction of public spending following upon restrictions in social security. Between 198o and 1997 the purchasing power held by those on the minimum wage went up by 28.8% in France. In the Netherlands it went down by 21.3%. Hence the remarkable growth in jobs. Annual increases in Dutch jobs have averaged 1.6% over the past 15 years. That is four times the European average and is equal to the American employment machine. Cutting taxes, not raising them, is the way to create jobs. 
Moreover, the Dutch welfare state has become increasingly unDutch. Cuts in public spending were heavily criticised by the unions and applauded by employers' organisations. The biggest post-war union demonstrations took place in the early 199os in protest against them. 
The success of the poldermodel was in fact made possible by a decisive break with the traditional semi-corporatist welfare state. The power of social partners to manage social security was broken. The Social and Economic Council became a mere shadow of its former self. It was no longer the crown jewel of policymaking machinery. 
The Rhineland model was thus not strengthened: rather the contrary. The reduction of the tax burden owing to the slimming of public finance; the policy to stop matching any increase in wages with an equal increase in minimum social benefits; the decentralisation of collective bargaining agreements; the reduction of benefits for the disabled; and the privatisation of health insurance: all these went against the grain of consensual politics. 
But how much success has the Dutch economy actually had? First, one can measure it by GDP per head. According to Eurostat, in 1998 the Netherlands was still only ninth among the 15 European Union countries. Second, employment. Job opportunities for low-skilled people remain scarce. In the retail trade, American employment figures are 60% higher than Dutch ones. Also, notwithstanding low official Dutch unemployment (on this, the Netherlands scores better than Germany, France and Italy), inactivity remains high. If statistics were to take into account all those who are able to work but who receive social benefits instead, unemployment figures would rise to over 20% of the labour force. 
Viewed in this light, the recent success of the Dutch economy is merely relative to a worse past. Of course, improvements have been made. The share of public expenditure in national income was 66% in 1985. Now it is so%. The government has made social security less collective by allowing privatisation and introducing market elements. In so doing, it has supported the setting of wages in private markets. It has also invested in infrastructure. But a favourable trade cycle helped too. More structural reforms are needed to improve Dutch performance and increase participation in the labour market. 
The case for further liberalisation In 1997, consultants at McKinsey published a report on the Dutch economy. Four important barriers were seen to play a key role in keeping the Netherlands behind other countries. First, a lack of competition. Consumer goods are approximately 20% more expensive in the Netherlands than in the United States. Higher margins signify less competition. Dutch legislation on competition has in the past been relatively lax. Recently the Dutch government passed a new law on competition which sets stricter rules. To boost growth the Netherlands will have to enforce those rules vigorously. 
The second barrier is formed by labourmarket rules, including those on working hours and on hiring and firing, and by stringent collective bargaining agreements. In the OECD Jobs Study of 1995 a ranking was made of the extent of labour market regulations, in which the Netherlands scored worse than the United States, Britain, Denmark and Japan. On a scale from o (overregulation) to lo (very little regulation), the Netherlands scores 4 points against the United States' 7. 
The third barrier has to do with the unattractive climate for setting up new companies in what are or should be fast-growing sectors. Strict regulation drives up labour costs. This is particularly true for small businesses. A recent international comparison of administrative costs in eight countries (including Germany and the United States) shows that the cost of hiring the first employee are highest in the Netherlands. 
The fourth barrier consists in the lack of incentives for the low-skilled to find jobs. Social security benefits in the Netherlands are still among the most generous in the world. Many of the unemployed are therefore stuck in a poverty trap. Wider margins between benefits and wages should lead to jobs becoming available for those who can work but now depend on social security. 
These recommendations imply that the Netherlands should keep moving in the same direction as in the past few years. Through deregulation the functioning of market mechanisms should be further improved and social security trimmed. In particular, the government must get a grip on the mounting number of registered disabled, of which there are many more in the Netherlands than in Germany or Belgium. Officially, 13% of the working population is now disabled. If a genuine figure, that would make the Netherlands the unhealthiest place in north-west Europe, despite having the highest life expectancy. 
In short, the Dutch economic order will have to move even further towards the Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism. Policies which point in that direction have begun to bear fruit. And such policies should not be construed, as many choose to, as a reinforcement of the Rhineland model. Quite the contrary. 
If the Netherlands still has a long way to go, that goes even more for those European countries which are still firmly stuck in the Rhineland rut. France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin, has proposed public works projects as an answer to unemployment. But such projects are financed either by raising taxes or by increasing the budget deficit. In the first case the number of jobs created by the additional public works will be smaller than that of jobs lost in the rest of the economy. Governments which want to avoid this problem by deficit financing will run into the obstacle of E Msu's anti-deficit rules. 
European unemployment is a manmade disaster. Policy harmonisation would cause this blight to spread. At the European summit in Austria last autumn, the chancellor of that country, Viktor Klima, said that co-ordination of economic policies was ""the key to creating employment"". Such calls are usually supported by governments which espouse unsuccessful policies. They say they fear that tax rates will suffer a race to the bottom. Harmonisation, though, is more likely to result in a race to the top. Altogether, it would lessen the pressure to carry out necessary but unpopular structural adjustments to the welfare state. 
In order to make the euro work, more flexibility in the labour market is needed since the instrument of devaluation no longer exists. Rhineland governments are uneasy about this-if not downright hostile. By creating the euro they have thus made a stick for their own back. They must either deregulate or infringe the rules of the E Mu. But this thought has yet to sink in. 
Should the Netherlands go all the way? Should it change to the type of market economy that exists in the United States? The Anglo-Saxon model has its own problems. Maximising utility in the short term leads to too few savings and insufficient investment. Americans have not invested enough in public provisions like infrastructure and education. In the Rhineland, savings are considerable and investments are on an altogether higher level. Social security will have to be trimmed but the essentials of the system can be retained, provided public expenditure is kept durably under control. 
A synthesis of the Anglo-Saxon and Rhineland models ought to be possible. A ""MidAtlantic"" model really would unite the positive elements of both. But that model has not yet been reached in the Netherlands. More liberalism is required if the Dutch economy is to achieve its potential and to raise living standards-and the same applies to the rest of the European Union, but even more so.

""If he had another job, I think he would be at home more often."" Perhaps. But then Wolfgang Schussel is not one of those (many) Austrians who traditionally seem to have time on their hands, airily regarding life's problems as ""disastrous but not serious"". Nor does he go in for that ultra-polite ambiguity brought to perfection-irritatingly, some say-over centuries in Vienna, his home city. As leader of the People's Party, the conservative partner of the Social Democrats in Austria's ""grand coalition"" government, he likens himself, not unfairly, to a sheepdog always circling his flock and baring his fangs at potential strays. 
Well, not quite always. Somehow the 54-year-old party boss, vice-chancellor, foreign minister, ex-economics minister (1989-95) and cartoonist has also found time to knock off books on tricky topics from privatisation to education. On the lighter side, he climbs mountains, goes skiing, plays the accordion, piano and guitar (jazz as well as classical), and has recently taken up the cello. When does he manage to practise? Around midnight, to wind down after a busy day. 
Not everyone is impressed by this restless polymath. ""He is phenomenally gifted,"" says a Schussel-watcher, ""but he flits from one brilliant idea to another and rarely follows through."" A butterfly then, rather than a sheepdog? Arguably, he could have pushed harder for a more drastic sale of state assets during his time at the economics ministry. But he stuck to his guns in favour of Austria joining the European Union and then Europe's single currency, when many Austrians had strong doubts about both. And he even, albeit briefly, brought down the grand coalition four years ago with demands for bigger budget cuts than the Social Democrats would tolerate. 
No negligible record, then. But his ""chirpy lawyer"" appearance does seem to meet the claim that he is, well, a bit of a lightweight: ever-present bow tie, trendy spectacles, spick, span and apparently cool, even on the muggiest Vienna day. How easy to imagine he was born to affluence and never really had to struggle. Easy but wrong. Young Wolfgang came from a broken home and financed his law studies at Vienna University with odd jobs, partly in journalism. That is one personal reason, perhaps, why he firmly exempts family benefit from his demand that the state's activities should be cut further and welfare trimmed. 
His one ambition-one, at any rate, that he is only too happy to talk about-is to see Austria back ""at the heart of Europe"", as it was during the centuries-long Hapsburg era that ended in collapse in 1918. Time was, he notes, when Vienna was the focal point for the countries of Central Europe. So it should be again, not of course as the seat of empire, but as a democratic, economic and social example. Grandiose ideas, perhaps too easily uttered amid the imperial splendour of Vienna: the Hofburg Palace, Heldenplatz (Heroes' Square) and a parliament building seemingly vast enough to embrace all 8m Austrians, not just their elected representatives. And surely the countries of the east hardly let their westward gaze linger on Austria, focusing rapidly instead on Berlin as Germany's reborn capital and seat of government, and perhaps even more intently on Brussels, headquarters of both NATO and the Eu. 
So they do, but that does not mean that Mr Schissel is suffering wholly from delusions of grandeur. Austria has special attractions for its eastern and southern neighbours precisely because it is not elephantine Germany; because its economic system (flawed and cosseted though it may be) still combines steady growth and scarcely perceptible inflation with social justice and unemployment of under 5%; and because historic links, whatever the sceptics say, still count. That goes not least for ties between Vienna and the Balkans. People in Ljubljana and Zagreb, capitals of Slovenia and Croatia, listen carefully to Mr Schssel. And perhaps no European minister has closer contacts with opposition (and future government?) leaders in Serbia. 
Mr Schussel's other big ambition is, almost certainly, to become chancellor as soon as possible-though naturally he is not saying much about that. On the face of it, his prospects look slim. At the last general election, in 1995, the Social Democrats won 38% of the vote to his People's Party's 28%. Both camps did fairly well in this month's poll for the European Parliament, while Jorg Haider's far-right Freedom Party, a potential coalition partner for Mr Schissel, lost ground. At the outset, then, the chances of a new government after the general election due on October 3rd look slim. 
Do not bet on it, though. There are growing personal and policy differences in the grand coalition, not least over whether Austria should seek to join NATO: Mr Schissel wants to, the Social Democratic chancellor, Viktor Klima, does not; indeed, he argues that neutrality still makes Austria (and Finland) better-placed to mediate when Balkan sparks fly. The chancellor's anti-NATo views helped Mr Klima during the recent election campaign, because most Austrians abhorred the bombing of Serbia even more, it seems, than they deplored Slobodan Milosevic. But with the war over and refugees streaming back into Kosovo, Mr Schussel reckons the Austrian mood on NATO will gradually shift to his advantage. 
Then there is a subtle change of perception, or at least of verbiage, about Mr Haider in Vienna these days. Instead of being called a ""far-right populist"" or even a ""fascist"", he tends to be described simply as ""unreliable"". Bad enough, of course, but no longer quite as damning. Besides, after 13 years of grand-coalition government, there is a ""time-for-a-change"" mood in the air, just as there was in Germany last autumn after i6 years of conservativeled rule. So could a government alliance be in the making this autumn between the Freedom Party (probably without Mr Haider in the cabinet) and the People's Party, with Mr Schussel as chancellor? For an answer take a look at a recent cartoon by Mr Schussel showing a wizard conjuring a genie out of a bottle. Beneath it is the inscription ""Impossible? Nothing is impossible."" ",""" STUPIDLY enough , my father is foreign minister , "" notes Daniel Schussel , aged ii , in the preface to a children 's book for which his dad drew the cartoons . "" If he had another job , I think he would be at home more often . "" Perhaps . But then Wolfgang Schussel is not one of those ( many ) Austrians who traditionally seem to have time on their hands , airily regarding life 's problems as "" disastrous but not serious "" . Nor does he go in for that ultra - polite ambiguity brought to perfection - irritatingly , some say - over centuries in Vienna , his home city . As leader of the People 's Party , the conservative partner of the Social Democrats in Austria 's "" grand coalition "" government , he likens himself , not unfairly , to a sheepdog always circling his flock and baring his fangs at potential strays . 
 Well , not quite always . Somehow the 54 - year - old party boss , vice - chancellor , foreign minister , ex - economics minister ( 1989 - 95 ) and cartoonist has also found time to knock off books on tricky topics from privatisation to education . On the lighter side , he climbs mountains , goes skiing , plays the accordion , piano and guitar ( jazz as well as classical ) , and has recently taken up the cello . When does he manage to practise ? Around midnight , to wind down after a busy day . 
 Not everyone is impressed by this restless polymath . "" He is phenomenally gifted , "" says a Schussel - watcher , "" but he flits from one brilliant idea to another and rarely follows through . "" A butterfly then , rather than a sheepdog ? Arguably , he could have pushed harder for a more drastic sale of state assets during his time at the economics ministry . But he stuck to his guns in favour of Austria joining the European Union and then Europe 's single currency , when many Austrians had strong doubts about both . And he even , albeit briefly , brought down the grand coalition four years ago with demands for bigger budget cuts than the Social Democrats would tolerate . 
 No negligible record , then . But his "" chirpy lawyer "" appearance does seem to meet the claim that he is , well , a bit of a lightweight : ever - present bow tie , trendy spectacles , spick , span and apparently cool , even on the muggiest Vienna day .

TEN years ago, dissident intellectuals helped topple Czechoslovakia's Communist regime. Arty sorts-playwrights, painters, philosophers-held office in the transitional government that followed, perhaps expecting an artistic flourishing of Czech life. Today, however, the currency of Czech intellectuals has been devalued by a decade of cynicism, pop culture, and the advent of the bottom line. 
Last month, a group of the Czech Republic's leading intellectuals, including Cardinal Miloslav Vlk, the country's top churchman, academics, actors and writers, united for the first time in ages to sign ""Impuls 99"", a manifesto urging politicians to stop bickering, to behave with less arrogance and to govern properly. A comeback of sorts for the Czech intellectual? Or just a doomed attempt to return to the days when people actually cared what a poet thought? 
The signatories of Impuls 99 say they simply want to give their politicians a kick in the pants. A recent poll suggested that 76% of Czechs are ""disgusted"" by their politicians. But these days they are not turning to intellectuals for answers. And politicians are more likely to regard intellectuals as a liability than an asset. 
Paradoxically, it was the collapse of communism that began to undermine the position of Czech intellectuals. Until 1989, they-or at least the heroic few with a dissident orientation-had a system to hate. Post-cold-war, this target collapsed. Motives were suddenly suspect. Were you a socialist, a neo-conservative, a Catholic revivalist, or did you simply want to make money? Though the brain drain abroad after 1989 was somewhat offset by the return of emigres, the internal loss of Czech intellectuals to commercialism has proved more damaging. 
Among the greatest contributors to this trend is Vladimir Zelezny, once a Czech dissident and co-founder of TV Nova, the country's most popular television station. Nova now feeds Czechs a brain-numbing diet of soap operas, American cop shows, and, yes, stark-naked weather-girls. Intellectuals complain that Nova is exploiting the ""moral vacuum"" left by communism. If it improved the quality of its shows, they argue, Czechs would follow. Mr Zelezny is unapologetic: ""We just show what the market wants."" If opera were as popular as guns and naked women, he says, Nova would show opera. 
With a playwright for a president (Vaclav Havel), and a fine literary tradition of their own (Milan Kundera, Ivan Klima, Bohumil Hrabal) Czechs have not abandoned high culture altogether. They remain avid theatre-goers, even in the provinces, and-despite the obliging efforts of TV Nova to supply lowbrow fareenthusiasts for opera and classical music, for which tickets are still partly state-subsidised. Czech cinema, more thoughtful than its Hollywood counterpart,just about holds its own. Publishing houses continue to put out provocative books, albeit with smaller print-runs. 
But the gradual withdrawal of state subsidy and the opening-up of the market has inevitably promoted popular culture at the expense of the highbrow version. Mr Zelezny says his former dissident friends now shun him for revealing a hard truth: most Czechs never particularly liked intellectuals. ""There was this myth among dissidents in communist times that ordinary Czechs were secretly reading Proust,"" says Mr Zelezny. ""Our market research showed Czechs were not refined intellectuals at all. They weren't interested in Proust at all. No! We discovered what they were: beer-drinking, working-class Catholics, rather like Belgians but less cultured."" Just the kind of talk to infuriate intellectuals.

Austria 
VIENNA 
UNGOVERNABLE? Surely not. Few countries in Europe look so cosily stable as Austria. Inflation is barely perceptible; less than 5% of its people are out of work; its budget deficit is well within the euro-zone's required 3% of GDP. Moreover, it has a generous, albeit somewhat slimmed, social-security system too. Enough to turn the neighbouring Germans, for instance, green with envy; and more than enough, you might think, to keep the 13-year-old ""grand coalition"" in Vienna between the Social Democrats and the centre-right People's Party comfortably in power after the nation goes to the polls on October 3rd. 
Do not bank on it. Rarely in post-war Austria has politics looked more volatile; never has the outcome of a general election there been harder to predict. The coalition may just squeak back, albeit looking anything but grand, with a sharply reduced parliamentary majority. Just as likely, it may break up. To be replaced by what? No one knows, though the possible permutations keep Viennese coffee houses humming with even more speculation than usual. 
The man most responsible for this eruption of doubt in a country that has long prized consensus and predictability is Jorg Haider, leader of the far-right Freedom Party. At 49, bursting with seemingly youthful vigour, and sporting an indelible tan that has won him the title of ""hero of the Solarium"", he is no newcomer. His admiration for Hitler's employment policy has long been well known; so too his opposition to immigration and, more recently, his distaste for Austrian membership of the European Union. 
The difference is that, when Mr Haider took over the then-liberal Freedom Party in 1985, it looked in danger of parliamentary extinction. Now it could well push ahead of the People's Party under Wolfgang Schussel, vice-chancellor and foreign minister, to become the country's second force. Latest polls give the Freedomites some 28% of the vote, ahead of Mr Schissel's lot, with 24%, and even within striking distance of the Social Democrats under Viktor Klima, the chancellor, with 35%. Two decades ago the Social Democrats were still notching up about 5o%, the conservatives nearly 40%. 
How has Mr Haider done it? Partly, it is true, by pandering to xenophobia and taking a tougher law-and-order stance than any rival. Witness the Freedom Party's current campaign slogans warning against ""Uberfremdung"" (too many foreigners) and demanding ""no quarter for drug dealers"". But xenophobia alone, even allied to Mr Haider's undeniable skill as a tub-thumper, would have been nothing like enough to put him so close to government power. 
Two other factors bolster Mr Haider. One is his criticism of the iniquitous but so far ineradicable Proporz system, under which ""reds and blacks"", as the two mainstream parties are known, carve up jobs and perks between them in every nook and cranny of Austrian life. For those who lose out, ""der Jorg"" seems their best hope against ""the powers that be up there in Vienna"". 
Mr Haider's second asset is his skill as a tactician, which is greater than he is often given credit for. Whatever the election result, he says, he will not give up his job as premier of the deep-south state of Carinthia for one in Vienna. Hence the man topping the Freedom Party's national list of candidates is not Mr Haider at all but Thomas Prinzhorn, a successful industrialist whose Thatcherite views are admired even by some of Mr Schussel's chums. So the Freedomites hope that many conservatives, fed up with the grand coalition but no fans of Mr Haider, will vote for the Freedom Party without fearing that its boss will pop up in government, let alone as its head. 
So could Austria be led by an alliance of ""black and blue"" (the Freedom Party hue) after the election on October 3rd, with a lot of string-pulling from Carinthia? A month or two ago, when opinion polls put the People's Party ahead of Mr Haider's lot, that seemed quite likely, with the bouncy, ambitious Mr Schussel as chancellor. But since then the conservatives have dropped to third place. If they do no better on election day, Mr Schussel says he will take them into opposition. But that could be bluff. Some of his colleagues would like to dump him as leader and hook up with Mr Haider anyway. Others with influence argue that the party needs a spell free of ""coalition contamination"". 
Where does that leave the increasingly harassed-looking Mr Klima? Time and again he has ruled out a coalition with the Freedom Party; his Social Democrats would split if he went back on that. He would almost certainly not command a parliamentary majority, even with a ""traffic light"" coalition including the Greens and the Liberal Forum (the ""real"" liberals, who broke away from the Haiderised Freedom Party). 
Meanwhile, the chancellor snarls at the People's Party for wanting to take Austria into NATO and abandon Austria's policy of ""perpetual neutrality"". Mr Schussel scorns as ""laughable"" Mr Klima's claim that 100,000 new jobs can be created more or less at the drop of a hat. Yet, despite such election-time sourness between partners, it is still possible that the present coalition might hang on. ","Could an extremist break Austria 's mould of consensus government ?

It is getting harder, though, to draw a line between the respectable right and the nasty right 
LAST weekend, in one of the most prosperous and steady countries in Europe, more than a quarter of those who voted plumped for a party whose leader, ]org Haider, is widely regarded-especially outside his own country-as the next worst thing to a Nazi. Each of Austria's two established parties, the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party, which have run the country between them since 1945, got their lowest proportion of the vote in any post-war election. Mr Haider's Freedom Party came second (though the final count of absentee ballots might yet bump it down to third) with 27%, behind the Social Democrats' 33% but a whisker ahead of the People's Party. Will Mr Haider now get his first slice of top-level power, in coalition? And, if he did so, would this mean that fascism was crawling back into the mainstream of European politics? 
The answers are that it is hard to say-- and no. The Social Democratic chancellor, Viktor Klima, who has governed Austria since 1997 in coalition with the People's Party under Wolfgang Schussel, says he will never share power with the Freedomites. Mr Schussel previously said he would bow out of government altogether if his lot came third. Though constitutionally feasible, it is unlikely that the Social Democrats, as the largest party, would rule as a minority government, perhaps with the Greens, who pulled in 7%; at a big pinch, they might just seek a minimal agreement (on a budget, for instance) with the mainstream conservatives, without resuming their 13-year-old coalition. But the big question is whether Mr Schussel might, after all, be prevailed upon by some of his power-hungrier colleagues to team up, as chancellor, with the controversial Mr Haider after all. 
To judge by the steamy comments of some leading politicians across the continent, an Austrian government with the Freedomites on board would put the country beyond the pale. Not so, said Edmund Stoiber, who leads Bavaria's right-wing Christian Social Union and is himself a possible future German chancellor. Looking south across his state's border, he said that a long period of rule by ""grand coalition"", as in Austria, was always bad; that, by implication, Mr Haider's lot had genuinely changed their spots; and that the mainstream conservatives should agree to share power with them. 
Other continental conservatives were less sanguine. Volker Ruhe, a leading German Christian Democrat, upbraided Mr Stoiber for his indulgence towards Mr Haider. Italy's former fascists, led by Gianfranco Fini, who themselves briefly shared power in a ruling coalition in 1994, sounded cautious: Italian and Austrian ultra-nationalists have unsettled territorial arguments. But Mr Fini said that Mr Haider was ""no racist and no Nazi"". 
So how frightening is he? There is no doubt that Mr Haider, the son of a Nazi official and notorious, some years ago, for praising aspects of Hitler's ""employment policy"" and for toasting a bunch of former ss veterans as ""decent fellows"", gets the old Nazi vote-in a country which never truly denazified itself and proportionately had more Nazi party members, in Hitler's time, than Germany did. Moreover, Mr Haider's people clearly pander to racial and xenophobic prejudice, harping on illegal immigration and the crime that they blame on it. 
But Mr Haider also espouses more defensible policies. His strongest card is opposition to the system of Proporz, whereby patronage for all sorts of public jobs, down to bottle-washers and drivers, still tends to be shared out among card-holders of the two establishment parties. Mr Haider has other strong views that are likewise unexceptionable on democratic grounds. He was against Austria joining the European Union, though he no longer argues for withdrawal; with immigration again in mind, he is against the EU'S east-bound expansion. Another policy puts him closer to most other continental mainstreamers: unlike Austria's Social Democrats, he, along with the People's Party, wants his country to join NATO. Lastly, he has shed the corporatism of his Nazi political forebears, arguing instead for privatisation and a low, flat tax on income. 
The real respectability yardstick, for Mr Haider and others with the far-right label, is whether they are true parliamentary democrats who accept the rule of law, replete with safeguards for minorities. Maybe they do now. Would they if by chance they won power-as Mr Haider conceivably might? 
Across Europe, the answers vary. Disciples of Jean-Marie Le Pen seem to long for a punch-up in the street. So do the hate-filled ultra-nationalists of Central and Eastern Europe, for whom parliaments are generally obstacles in countries where democracy is still taking root-for instance, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Russia itself. But nowhere is fascism clearly a looming feature of the political landscape. 
More promisingly, several political parties that have roots in anti-democracy have genuinely joined the mainstream: despite their lineal descent from Mussolini, Italy's post-fascists, under the rather canny Gianfranco Fini, are nowadays accepted, even on the left, as having a legitimate role-as democrats. And in Spain, the ruling mainstream conservative People's Party, under Jose Maria Aznar, which pulls together several strands including one that threads back to the old authoritarian right of General Franco, has moved far enough to the centre to have made its leader an avowed political soulmate of Britain's Tony Blair. 
There are also parties with the far-right tag which are, in fact, extreme libertarian, and which, by the by, want to squeeze the welfare state. In Norway, where such attitudes are controversial, Carl Hagen's Progress Party has steadily crept up in the polls, and now gets about 15%, but he is hardly a threat to Scandinavian democracy, let alone heir to the viciousness of Vidkun Quisling, Hitler's Norwegian nominee. Likewise, in Switzerland, the flinty, populist, anti-Eu People's Party, with-yes-a whiff of anti-immigrant nastiness (a charge also laid against Mr Hagen), has had similar success challenging the woollier conservatism of the Christian Democrats for the mantle of the broad right. But it would be unfair to call it crypto-Nazi. 
All told, parties with a Nazi flavour are doing poorly across the continent. In southem Europe, where post-war democracy was once weakest, the anti-democratic parties, from Portugal to Greece, have fizzled. In northern Europe, xenophobic parties (in Denmark, for instance, and in ethnically divided Belgium) can sometimes notch up weighty scores in decrepit cities, often egged on by hostility to the sovereignty-eroding European Union. But they never come close to getting real power, beyond the odd city hall. In France, the splitting of Mr Le Pen's National Front into two wings, one of them purporting to be more civilised than the other, seems to have done for both bits of it. 
The worst recent outbreak of the nastier sort of far-right virus has been in eastern Germany, where the racist German People's Union (DVU), exploiting high unemployment and post-unification trauma, got 13% in a state election last year. But its vote slumped thereafter. Germany's twitchiness about its past is still reassuringly acute: there is little sign of a thorough-going far-right revival. 
Anglo-Saxons and perhaps Nordics, without the baggage of a recent fascist, communist or authoritarian past, are more comfortable with the simple labels ""right"" and ""left"". Other continentals prefer ""centre-- right"" and ""centre-left"", fearing that plain ""right"" carries a hint of anti-democracy. More and more continentals tend to think, ""We are all centrists now."" Even the once undoubted far-righters, such as Messrs Fini and Haider in Italy and Austria, would love to relabel themselves as just plain right. 
A certain queasiness is inevitable when their vote count starts matching or even overtaking their rivals on the old centre-- right. In the early 1920s, their forebears were unwisely shrugged off, often as comical irrelevances. But that was then. Democracy nowadays is much stronger, prosperity much more widely spread. It would be better if Mr Haider were sent packing. But-thanks in part to the transnational strictures of the European Union-neither Austria nor Europe will suffer unduly if he is not. ","The strong showing of a far - right party in Austria 's recent general election does not suggest a continental revival of the kind of politics that ruined Europe half a century ago . It is getting harder , though , to draw a line between the respectable right and the nasty right 
 LAST weekend , in one of the most prosperous and steady countries in Europe , more than a quarter of those who voted plumped for a party whose leader , ] org Haider , is widely regarded - especially outside his own country - as the next worst thing to a Nazi . Each of Austria 's two established parties , the Social Democrats and the conservative People 's Party , which have run the country between them since 1945 , got their lowest proportion of the vote in any post - war election . Mr Haider 's Freedom Party came second ( though the final count of absentee ballots might yet bump it down to third ) with 27 % , behind the Social Democrats ' 33 % but a whisker ahead of the People 's Party . Will Mr Haider now get his first slice of top - level power , in coalition ? And , if he did so , would this mean that fascism was crawling back into the mainstream of European politics ? 
 The answers are that it is hard to say-- and no . Viktor Klima's , says Viktor Klima will never share power with the Freedomites . Mr Schussel previously said he would bow out of government altogether if his lot came third . Though constitutionally feasible , it is unlikely that the Social Democrats , as the largest party , would rule as a minority government , perhaps with the Greens , who pulled in 7 % ; at a big pinch , they might just seek a minimal agreement ( on a budget , for instance ) with the mainstream conservatives , without resuming their 13 - year - old coalition . But the big question is whether Mr Schussel might , after all , be prevailed upon by some of his power - hungrier colleagues to team up , as chancellor , with the controversial Mr Haider after all . 
 To judge by the steamy comments of some leading politicians across the continent , an Austrian government with the Freedomites on board would put the country beyond the pale . Not so , said Edmund Stoiber , who leads Bavaria 's right - wing Christian Social Union and is himself a possible future German chancellor . Looking south across his state 's border , he said that a long period of rule by "" grand coalition "" , as in Austria , was always bad ; that , by implication , Mr Haider 's lot had genuinely changed their spots ; and that the mainstream conservatives should agree to share power with them . 
 Other continental conservatives were less sanguine . Volker Ruhe , a leading German Christian Democrat , upbraided Mr Stoiber for his indulgence towards Mr Haider . Italy 's former fascists , led by Gianfranco Fini , who themselves briefly shared power in a ruling coalition in 1994 , sounded cautious : Italian and Austrian ultra - nationalists have unsettled territorial arguments . But Mr Fini said that Mr Haider was "" no racist and no Nazi "" . 
 So how frightening is he ? There is no doubt that Mr Haider , the son of a Nazi official and notorious , some years ago , for praising aspects of Hitler 's "" employment policy "" and for toasting a bunch of former ss veterans as "" decent fellows "" , gets the old Nazi vote - in a country which never truly denazified itself and proportionately had more Nazi party members , in Hitler 's time , than Germany did . Moreover , Mr Haider 's people clearly pander to racial and xenophobic prejudice , harping on illegal immigration and the crime that they blame on it . 
 But Mr Haider also espouses more defensible policies . His strongest card is opposition to the system of Proporz , whereby patronage for all sorts of public jobs , down to bottle - washers and drivers , still tends to be shared out among card - holders of the two establishment parties . Mr Haider has other strong views that are likewise unexceptionable on democratic grounds . He was against Austria joining the European Union , though he no longer argues for withdrawal ; with immigration again in mind , he is against the EU 'S east - bound expansion . Another policy puts him closer to most other continental mainstreamers : unlike Austria 's Social Democrats , he , along with the People 's Party , wants his country to join NATO . Lastly , he has shed the corporatism of his Nazi political forebears , arguing instead for privatisation and a low , flat tax on income . 
 The real respectability yardstick , for Mr Haider and others with the far - right label , is whether they are true parliamentary democrats who accept the rule of law , replete with safeguards for minorities . Maybe they do now . Would they if by chance they won power - as Mr Haider conceivably might ? 
 Across Europe , the answers vary . Disciples of Jean - Marie Le Pen seem to long for a punch - up in the street . So do the hate - filled ultra - nationalists of Central and Eastern Europe , for whom parliaments are generally obstacles in countries where democracy is still taking root - for instance , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary and Russia itself . But nowhere is fascism clearly a looming feature of the political landscape .

FOR seven and a half years, Austria's chancellor, Werner Faymann, survived the fall-out of the world financial crisis, turmoil in the euro zone, a wave of refugees and more than a dozen electoral setbacks for his Social Democratic party. As of last week, he was the European Union's second-longest-serving head of government, after Germany's Angela Merkel. 
But the first round of Austria's presidential elections last month, where his party's candidate won a dismal 11% of the vote, was one defeat too many. At the traditional May Day parade, party stalwarts turned away and young activists booed him. On May 9th Mr Faymann stepped down. A politician better at infighting than public speaking, he leaves behind a divided party and a precarious government. 
The coalition, with the centre-right People's Party as junior partners, enjoys a slim majority in parliament. But it is under attack from the far-right Freedom Party, which is well ahead in the opinion polls. Norbert Hofer, its soft-spoken candidate for the federal presidency, got 35% in the first round and is the favourite to win the run-off on May 22nd. The position is mostly ceremonial, but can exercise real power in uncertain times. Mr Hofer has threatened to try to block EU trade agreements, and to dismiss parliament if it raises taxes or relaxes immigration barriers. 
The Freedom Party has been riding a wave of discontent with both governing parties, which have been ruling jointly or in alternation since 1945. It got its biggest boost last year, when about 1m migrants from the Middle East came through the country. Though most moved on to Germany and Sweden, 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria last year, a large number for a nation of 8m citizens. 
Mr Faymann at first stood by Mrs Merkel in her determination to keep the doors open for refugees. But under pressure from public opinion and his coalition partner, he agreed in January to erect border controls and cap the number of asylum-seekers allowed in, triggering a wave of border closures through the Balkans. The volte-face split the party: left-wingers accused Mr Faymann of kissing up to the Freedom Party, while centrists said the party should start to cooperate with the far right. 
This rift puts Mr Faymann's successor in a tricky position. The most likely candidate is Christian Kern, the boss of the state-owned railway company, who has strong roots in the party but no experience of day-to-day politics. He will be more willing to undertake business-friendly economic reforms than Mr Faymann was, says Thomas Hofer, a political analyst, ""but it will be a hard sell within the party."" 
The refugee policy, however, is unlikely to change. The People's Party says it will remain in the coalition only if the borders remain shut for most asylum-seekers. Reinhold Mitterlehner, the party leader, is under pressure because of poor polls and must compete for popularity with Sebastian Kurz, the foreign minister, a charismatic 29-year-old who takes hard-line positions on immigration. Both parties will want to avoid snap elections before their term ends in 2018. 
A victory for the far-right presidential candidate may, paradoxically, boost the fortunes of the coalition, says Mr Hofer. It would bring its parties closer together, fearing a far-right power grab. Neither Social Democrats nor conservatives will want to play junior partner to a populist Freedom Party and its rabble-rousing leader, Heinz-Christian Strache. Thanks to a lack of good alternatives, the old coalition could live on, warts and all.

AUSTRIA'S far-right Freedom Party (FPO) is finding it hard to come to terms with defeat. On December 4th its candidate, Norbert Hofer, lost to Alexander van der Bellen (pictured), an ex-leader of the Green party, in a rerun of the country's presidential election. Two days later the FPO's leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, blamed the loss on ""overwhelming media power"", which painted Mr Hofer as ""the devil incarnate"". On social media, Mr Hofer's supporters alleged massive voter fraud. 
Their disappointment was understandable. Mr Hofer drew a respectable 46.7% of the votes, but he had expected to win, after falling just 31,000 votes short in the initial election in May. (That vote was annulled by the country's constitutional court because of irregularities.) Instead, Mr Van der Bellen's lead grew. Every other big party, as well as business leaders, artists, intellectuals and the mainstream media rallied behind him, hoping to avoid the embarrassment of being the first country in Western Europe to elect a far-right head of state since the second world war. The result suggested that most Austrians remain committed to European integration, the main theme of Mr Van der Bellen's campaign. 
The demography of the vote resembled that of the Brexit ballot in Britain and Donald Trump's election in America (see chart). The populist Mr Hofer won majorities among men, those with less education and residents of rural areas. Women, those with higher education and city-dwellers backed Mr Van der Bellen. 
The outcome is welcome news for Austria's embattled coalition of Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party, which had shown signs of falling apart. A day after the election the Social Democratic chancellor, Christian Kern, and Reinhold Mitterlehner, the People's Party chief, vowed to stick it out until the end of the parliamentary term in 2018. Austria's federal presidency is a mostly ceremonial post, but Mr Hofer could have used the office to put pressure on the government to step down. Poll after poll shows the FPO ahead of the two governing parties. But Mr Van der Bellen has said repeatedly that he would not appoint Mr Strache as chancellor, even if the FPO finishes first, because of its anti-European views. 
Before the run-off, several senior officials in the People's Party defied Mr Mitterlehner by openly supporting Mr Hofer, a possible step toward forming a coalition with the FPO. The two parties governed together in the 2000s, when the FPO was led by Jorg Haider, a charismatic rabble-rouser. That government faced massive protests, and was briefly shunned by other European states. But with the rise of far-right parties in other European countries, a government that included the FPO would probably not face such ostracism. Even some regional Social Democratic leaders are calling for an end to the decade-old policy of ruling out coalitions with the FPO. This only forces the party into a permanent grand coalition with the People's Party, they say, feeding voters' frustration and strengthening the populists. 
If elections were held today, polls show that the coalition would fall short of a majority in parliament, giving Mr Strache a chance to become chancellor. But thanks to Mr Hofer's defeat, the government has gained some time to improve its dismal popularity rating. The refugee crisis that began in 2015, in which Austria received over 100,000 asylum-seekers from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, stoked anti-Muslim sentiment and boosted the FPO. A mediocre economy has also hurt the government. GDP grew by less than 1% a year in 2014 and 2015, though it has picked up since. Unemployment was at 5.9% in October, a high rate for Austria, though few other European countries would complain. 
Most damaging to the government are the constant disputes between the two parties. If Mr Kern and Mr Mitterlehner cannot turn things around, the FPO will quickly recover from the latest setback. If it wins the next general election, even Mr Van der Bellen may not be able to stop Mr Strache. In the rise of Europe's populist parties, Austria was once far ahead of the pack. It has fallen behind, but may not stay there for long.

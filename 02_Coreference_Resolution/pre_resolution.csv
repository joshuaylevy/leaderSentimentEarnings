Saddam Hussein celebrated Bill Clinton's inauguration by announcing a unilateral truce. This was expected to end the current round of retaliatory attacks against Iraq. To eneral head-shaking, America, with Britain and France in support, had struck anti-aircraft sites in the no-fly zones; American cruise missiles hit a factory and a Baghdad hotel.
A first batch of American marines was withdrawn from Somalia in preparation for the eventual transition to UN command. Somali warlords managed, despite dire predictions, to patch together a frail agreement.
Israel repealed a six-year ban on contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The 400-plus Palestinians it deported in mid-December remain stuck in no-man's-land. In the occupied Gaza Strip, five children were killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians.
The government of Kenya called on the United Nations to repatriate nearly 500,000 Somali, Sudanese and Ethiopian refuees living in the north of the countly. It said that Kenya could not afford to keep them, and that armed Somali bandits were spreading lawlessness in the camps.
President Mobutu of Zaire was found guilty by his own parliament of high treason. He remained in power.
South Africa's overnment began a new round of bilateral talks with the African National Congress. These should pave the way for multi-party negotiations to start again in March.
With generous financial help from the Japanese government, Hiroshi Nakajima has been re-elected to another term as director-general of the World Health Organisation.
CROSSED FINGERS
The Bosnian Serbs'self-styled parliament approved a peace proposal for Bosnia & Hercegovina proposed by the EC and UN mediators, Lord Owen and Cyrus Vance. Still to be settled are the borders of the ten autonomous provinces proposed by the two mediators, the division of powers between central government and the provinces, and an overall ceasefire. Fighting continued between Muslims and Croats, nominally allies against the Serbs.
Salvatore (""Toto"") Riina, alIed ""boss of bosses"" of the Sicilian Mafia, was arrested in Palermo after 22 years on the run. He is accused, among other things, of ordering the murders ofa Christian Democratic politician and two anti-Mafia magistrates. He had already been found guilty of ordering the murders of two rival bosses.
Among other minor cabinet shuffles, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany replaced the disgraced economics minister, Jurgen Mollenmann, with Gunter Rexrodt, a director of the Treuhand privatisation agency.
The prime minister of Denmark, Poul Schlter, resigned after being rebuked by a senior judge for misleading parliament about delays in granting visas to the families of Tamil immirants. Mr Schluter, whose ten years as prime minister contributed to a remarkable improvement in the Danish economy, is due to be replaced by the Social Democratic leader, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.
SWORN IN
Bill Clinton was sworn in as 42nd president of the United States. In a short inaugural address, Mr Clinton dwelt on domestic affairs, and promised to cut the deficit and end the politics of drift and deadlock.
A severely disabled man was executed in Virginia's electric chair. Charles Stamper, a cook who murdered three of his co-workers, asked for leg braces and a walker so that he could take the last few steps to the chair. His request was refused.
A Justice Department ethics inquiry found that William Sessions, the FBI director, engaged in a ""sham arranement"" to avoid paying taxes on the unofficial use of his government limousine, and used his official aircraft for personal trips.
Bill Clinton's choice for attorney-eneral, Zoe Baird, apologised to the Senate Judiciary Committee for hiring illeal aliens as baby sitters. Despite her wrongdoing, her confirmation looks certain.
BULLETS AND BALLOTS
With Chinese new year starting on January 23rd, China's courts did their traditional ""clean-up"" of cases by sentencing to death 55 people accused of murder, fraud and other crimes. The executions took place immediately with a bullet in the back of the head.

America may wonder. On January 20th, dazzled by fireworks and deafened by rock, the nation made the change from inchoate, weary government to something like pandemonium. All presidents come in on a burst of energy, fuelled by expectations. Even George Bush, in his first months in office, was likened to a boy-prince in a castle full of gadgets, wanting to pull all the ropes and press all the buttons at once.
Burdens of office soon crowded in; the eye dulled, and the foot dragged. Yet Bill Clinton's sources of energy are so diverse that they may last much longer, even for a full four years. He is young to be a president. He relishes the play of political forces and the taste of power. That blow-dried head fairly fizzes with ideas. And he is being pushed from without, as well as within.
At his back--positioned perhaps to stab him eventually, but for now gracefully compliant--stands a Democratic Party released from 12 years in the wilderness, with a slew of policies waiting to be put into practice. At his side, for as long as it suits its interests to be there, is a Democratic Congress burning to make laws after a decade of obstruction. Already crowding into the lobbies are the groups that elected Mr Clinton with their money or their votes, or both, and have come to collect. Out on the streets are all those Americans who asked him, implicitly or explicitly, for change, and want it sooner rather than later. And beyond them is a world newly fractious and dangerous, full of energies released from the constraints of the cold war.
STRUGGLING FORWARD, SLIDING BACK
Whirling into power, Mr Clinton is about to discover the weakness of his office. The change is as sobering as a bucket of cold water. Although everything is expected, everything must be struggled for. Almost nothing can be done by fiat. The permission of Congress must be sought over appointments, treaties, laws and anything involving money; from morning to night, a president must cajole and bully and persuade. Yet he can also work too hard. If energy is not wisely used, it will destroy that small amount of power and respect a president can command. Cautionary tales are all around: of Jimmy Carter, who tried to come in firing on all cylinders, but gave Congress more legislation than it could cope with; of Richard Nixon, who used so much energy to destroy his political opponents that he destroyed himself; of Lyndon Johnson, who gave himself up so ferociously to bargaining and deal-making that he seemed, in the end, to leave principle behind.
At present, Mr Carter's misspent energy is the example Mr Clinton fears most. He has the same propensity to want to put his finger into every pie, to discourse on M1 and cost-of-living allowances until his audience snores, and to put forward over-stuffed legislation on every conceivable subject. Aware of this, Mr Clinton has now backed away from many of the specific things he said he would do (such as halving the budget deficit over four years, and cutting middle-class taxes) and even from some of the general ones, such as welfare reform. He now seems ready to content himself with fewer promises and smaller victories, if he can get them.
This willingness to backtrack implies nimbleness, flexibility, willingness to adjust to events. Yet there are warning signs in it, too. Mr Clinton has slid back partly because the facts and figures have shifted, as with the deficit; but also because he ran into sins of opposition from his advisers, or because the polls looked bad. Mr Clinton's most energetic efforts, ever since his defeat in the Arkansas governor's race in 1980, have been put into making sure everyone is with him, and catered for, and happy. On the small field of Arkansas, that approach worked well. It will not work for a superpower. As Hamilton said, a president's energy must direct the country: provide the initiative and motive force for legislation, make the final judgment in foreign disputes, steer a course between factions. Mr Clinton has made a hard job harder, picking a cabinet in which women had to be balanced with men, blacks with whites, statists with progressives, growth-boosters with deficit-cutters. Possibly he intends, like Franklin Roosevelt, to enjoy the rumpus, and to use administrative chaos as a foil to show that he is in control. Yet this cabinet, designed to ""look like America"", is in danger of representing the worst face of the country, interest group against interest group, all clamouring for attention. Mr Clinton may well be tugged this way and that as different arguments appeal, and that is only the first layer of persuasion. Congressmen and lobbyists have their arguments too, and their inducements. The hyperactive Mr Clinton is likely to be working them all, smiling, hugging, listening, and trying his damnedest not to disappoint.
He has promised to listen to the people, too. There is talk of a permanent campaign, backed up with appearances on MTV and Larry King and Donahue, in which every issue is put to the people as well as to Congress, and the polls are scrutinised daily. Modern American presidents, to be sure, draw their authority from popular approval as well as from the law. Yet popular sentiment is so volatile that the wisest presidents have always known when to avoid it. Even Ronald Reagan, who used the polls and the media to great effect, made sure to balance them with supreme self-confidence in his own opinions on one or two subjects, and to stick to them.
If Mr Clinton wishes to be the head of government, rather than a demagogic, free-floating figure committed to nothing so much as his own re-election, he too must have at least some broad ideas on which he will not shift. If he thinks that deficit-cutting is important, or that free trade is (and trade, which will confront him with some of his first decisions, should be much higher up his list of priorities), he must not only tell the people, but must continue to say so when they hate him for it. That is the hard part.
It is made all the harder by events. Left with a stand-off with Iraq and a worsening war in the Balkans, Mr Clinton must direct much of his early attention abroad. The world, too, holds dangerous temptations for a new president with little international experience. Although Americans shudder at the thought of long-term military commitments, a short-term show of strength can do wonders for a president's ratings. As commander-in-chief, he is less fettered than in any of the other presidential roles. He can play at real power. The world, looking to America for leadership, both demands Mr Clinton's energy and fears it. The way to defuse that fear is to link America's money and purpose to the United Nations, so that its foreign Forays have multilateral backing, wherever possible. That should remain a cardinal aim of Mr Clinton's foreign policy.
No one emerging from the last sleepwalking year of Mr Bush would wish Mr Clinton's energy to be weaker, or his ambitions to be meaner. But the virtues this president needs to cultivate, above all, are decisiveness and self-restraint. The first will channel his energy in definite directions. The second will hold back his populist impulses. To draw in, rather than to give out, may go against the grain of a man who naturally tries to embrace everything at once, in fast-food joints as in legislative anterooms, as if his life depended on it. Yet by steadiness, refusal to make promises and tenacity in his own opinions, America's Mr Fizz can prove there is more in his mind than political survival: such as the steering of his country, and the safety of the world.",True,
1993-01-23,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224138038/fulltext/4AFD62EF6E344895PQ/6?accountid=14657,"It is hard not to get excited about a country of 1.2 billion people whose economy grew by more than 12% in real terms last year and could well grow by a further 10% or so in 1993. But excited is a mild word for what foreign investors now feel about China. The Chinese government says that last year foreigners committed themselves to invest $58 billion in 40,000 projects in China. In the end this figure will prove to have been an exaggeration of China-like proportions, but the $9 billion-10 billion-worth of foreign investment that actually made its way into the country last year was still almost the same as was by the United States, the world's biggest economy. Foreign traders, investors and buyers of securities are right, in the long run, to be devoting a lot of attention to China. Last year the dollar value of China's exports rose 22%, to $85 billion, and imports 27%, to $81 billion; this year China's trade should exceed $200 billion, making it roughly the world's tenth-biggest trading nation. China is already the world's biggest importer of wheat. It will probably be the biggest telecoms-equipment market between now and 2000. And a swathe of 300m people in China's coastal provinces are about to experience a huge consumer-goods boom (see page 70).
Nonetheless, many foreigners, abetted by overly cheerful Chinese economists, are tempted to forget that China is no more exempt from the laws of economic gravity than was Japan in the late 1980s, when some people claimed that the Rising Sun and its stockmarket would go on rising for ever. Even if a trade war between China and Bill Clinton's America is averted, this year and next are liable to be awkward for China, with crashing stockmarkets and property prices and a clampdown on credit. Not only will China itself be afflicted; so will places whose economies have become ever more entwined with China's, in particular Hong Kong.
AFTER GO, STOP
The main reason to expect trouble in China is inflation. Ever since Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms began in the late 1970s, the liberalising Chinese economy has been plagued by stop-go cycles of increasing severity. Two previous rounds of double-digit economic growth that got out of hand-in 1984-85 and 1987-88-led to frightening price rises, unbridled corruption and (indirectly, in the second instance) the Tiwananmen Square killing of June 1989.
Optimists in China and Hong Kong say that history is not about to repeat itself. First, they note, even after two years of economic expansion there is little sign of heavy pressure on prices. Consumer prices nationwide rose by less than 6% in 1992, though by twice that in the big cities. Second, China is no longer an economy of shortages. In 1988 people began hoarding goods in panic because they interpreted the initial rise in prices as a forerunner of the disappearance of the goods. Today, with most goods distributed through the market rather than the plan, shop shelves are groaning and household bank deposits rising: no worries here about vanishing goods or a collapsing currency. Third, China's leaders are acutely aware of the disaster that befell the country in 1988-89 when they dawdled about cooling the economy. They will not, runs the argument, make that mistake again.
All this is unconvincing. It is true that, with extensive price reform and freeish foreign trade and investment, China has escaped from the chronic shortages typical of communism. But so have capitalist countries, and that has hardly immunised them from inflation.
China's price rises have so far been modest, but the warning bells are clanging. The narrow measure of money, MO, may have risen by as much as 40% last year; M2 grew by almost 30% a year between mid-1990 and mid-1992, and for 1992 as a whole it probably grew faster than 30%. Prices of raw materials rose sharply last year, property prices in the coastal boom-towns are soaring, the spot-market exchange rate for the yuan has fallen far, and the current account is deteriorating. Worst of all, even if China's leaders are reading these sins correctly, they have no monetary instruments more discriminating than credit quotas to use in trying to forestall a burst of price rises.
A stop-go lurch is in fact built into China's still only half-reformed economy. The bright side to the upcoming price troubles is that they might at last create the conditions for a break-through to true capitalism in China (see page 61). But meanwhile the risks of instability are high. For company presidents and the American president alike, this is the time for a long view rather than a quick killing in China.",True,
1993-01-23,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224126100/fulltext/4AFD62EF6E344895PQ/7?accountid=14657,"Opinion about the war in what was Yuoslavia veers between extremes. At times the Serbs seem to be behaving as latter-day Nazis who punish people or their origins and respect only force. At other times, as now, moral clarity tends to vanish in the murk of a three-sided conflict. Serbia's leaders, who encouraged war in Bosnia and who bear indirect responsibility for many of its most vicious crimes, appear to want peace, while Bosnia's Croats and Muslims, who are meant to be allies against the Serbs, are in parts of Bosnia at each other's throats.
From the start of this vile war, the outside world has tried to balance the urge to intervene with an instinct to keep out. At the end of last year, pressure on the governments of Western Europe and America grew for military action against the Bosnian Serbs and even against Serbia itself. This was resisted for reasons good and bad. The bad reason was fear of losing troops: democracies must sometimes fight or their principles. The good reasons were the lack of clear military goals, the vulnerability of United Nations aid-workers and peacekeepers, who in much of Bosnia were making horror less horrible, and signs that the Serbs themselves wanted a way out of the war.
Instead, the world decided in December to give the peace plan of its negotiators, Lord Owen and Cyrus Vance, another chance. That amble may--just may--be paying off. In Geneva earlier this month, Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, and Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, argreed in principle to the Owen-Vance plan, as did the Croats and Muslims. This plan would save Bosnia, legally, from dismemberment by splitting it into ten provinces. In three each of these, Croats, Muslims or Serbs would predominate, leaving the capital, Sarajevo, to be held in common as the seat of a weak central government. At the same time, the leaders of Croatia and Serbia agreed to meet again to try to settle their differences over the future of the Serb enclaves in Croatia.
Talk costs little. This war has produced countless ceasefires and broken agreements. Is this one different? There are reasons for thinking it may be. Despite confusing flare-ups between Croats and Muslims, an end to the worst fighting in Bosnia looks nearer than it did. Nor is agreement impossible between Croatia and Serbia (which, though not fighting each other, are not technically at peace).
Nothing in the Balkans is sure, but the main reason behind the hopes for peace is the apparent change in Serbia. Much as he did last year at the end of Serbia's war with Croatia, Mr Milosevic seems to have concluded that a settlement is in his country's best interest. Diplomatic and commercial isolation is taking its toll in Serbia & Montenero (all that remains of a no longer-recognised Yuoslavia). The threat of outside force, though ill-defined, has not one away. To many nationalists in the capital, Belrade, war has come to look too costly a route to the goal of Greater Serbia, a new state embracing the Serbs of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. Mr Milosevic seems to want to persuade the Bosnian Serbs of this, just as he persuaded the Croatian Serbs of it last year.
NO WITHDRAWAL YET
This dim but discernible chance for peace presents the world with the opposite problem of the one last autumn. Unless Serbia begins again to misbehave, the temptation for the world will be to heave a sigh of relief and begin to disengage, leaving ex-Yuoslavia to its self-inflicted misery. That would be disastrous. Pressure for a just peace, including military pressure if need be, has to be kept up. If the Serbs do again misbehave, the world must be ready to enforce its threats against them. Croats and Muslims, who have been hitting back against the Serbs, have to be convinced they have more to win by negotiation. Nothing is yet certain, least of all whether the Bosnian Serbs and their self-styled parliament, despite their belated acceptance of the Owen-Vance plan, can really be counted on to live by it in earnest and begin to negotiate its details (see page 45). Big issues about land and people, the stakes in this war, remain open. There is no agreement on the map. Under the plan, the Bosnian Serbs would give up much of what they have seized, and would not be allowed to control the northern corridor that at present provides a link to one of their strongholds. Croats and Muslims have land claims against each other. About 1.5m Bosnians have fled their homes in the war. Resettling even some of them will be a long, perilous business that risks new fighting. If guns fall silent in Bosnia, the madder nationalists in Serbia could try to start trouble in Kosovo or Macedonia. The extent of political rights for the Serb enclaves of Croatia has yet to be settled.
All of this suggests that the world is about to get more, not less, drawn into the Balkans. More than 20,000 UN peacekeepers are in the middle of the puzzle. The West's military men are arguing with good reason that these troops should either be pulled out or reinforced and given a broader remit to fight back. If peace does come, it will need years of UN policing. If peace is held up by local Serb militias, the world will be obliged to hit back at them. If it becomes clear that the change in Belgrade is more for show than for real, and that Mr Milosevic's search for peace is merely a pause for breath between punches, then the outside world--meaning Bill Clinton and his European partners--will have little choice but to take the military action they have so long balked at. They will have to try to knock sense into the Serbian president, talk having failed.",True,
1993-01-23,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144720/fulltext/4AFD62EF6E344895PQ/11?accountid=14657,"The one thing his aides had told him to do was to keep it brief, and for once he listened. On January 20th, moments after being sworn in as America's 42nd president, Bill Clinton gave an inaugural address that clocked in at under 15 minutes. For a politician whose two most important previous speeches-accepting his party's nomination at the Democratic convention last July and nominating Michael Dukakis in 1988--were both rambling bores, this was no small triumph. But like the other symbolic victories of Mr Clinton's inaugural week, this one will be fleeting. The time for talk is over.
That is something Mr Clinton knows only too well. The four days of inaugural shindigs provided a welcome space between the final week of the transition, which everyone agrees was his worst since winning the election, and the pile of policy questions that demand his attention sooner rather than later. At the top of that pile is Iraq, a stubborn problem that threatened throughout the inaugural week to shatter the capital's celebratory mood, and which will almost certainly be the first big foreign-policy decision the new president will have to take. What Mr Clinton will do is far from clear. There are rumours (denied by all) that Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs, has been urging Mr Clinton to hit Saddam hard, and soon. Such talk, along with images of firepower over Baghdad counterposed with those of fireworks over the Washington monument, helped to make the inaugural circus supremely surreal. Not that the event, which featured everything from Slovakian folk dancers to Jack Nicholson reciting Lincoln to Nelson Mandela begging for tickets to the MTV ball, needed much help in the surrealism department. With a swirl of mink and celebrity unseen in Washington since the days of Ronald Reagan, the Democrats staged an inauguration that even Donald Trump thought was ""a little much"".
Through it all, Mr Clinton behaved as if the campaign were on again: he seemed to be everywhere, pumping the hands of his countless friends. By January 20th, all that remained was the speech. As is his wont, Mr Clinton had studied the words of other first time presidents: Woodrow Wilson, another southern-born, northern-educated governor who won the presidency in a three-man race, and whose 11-paragraph address was a model of getting to the point, was apparently a particular inspiration. (Wilson's opening line: ""There has been a change of government."")
In his own speech Mr Clinton revisited the economic and communitarian themes of his campaign: the need to adapt America's economy to a rapidly changing world; to ""offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all""; to instill a sense of mutual obligation among citizens. He struck a populist, Perotist note too, talking of cutting the deficit and promising to ""give this capital back to the people to whom it belongs"".
Mr Clinton is no orator, and this was not a great speech. But it was clear and solid and spoken with the conviction of a man who has been thinking about becoming president since before he learnt to do up his shoes. That is something of a change from his recent behaviour. Since the economic summit in Little Rock in mid-December, for which he received glowing reviews, Mr Clinton has not been on his finest form. Although he and his team just squeaked through their self-appointed deadline of Christmas for picking cabinet members, most sub-cabinet positions--the people who actually run the government--remain unfilled. So long as that is so, Mr Clinton will have a hard time getting off to the flying start he hoped for.
In fact, by the last week of the transition Mr Clinton had all but conceded as much. The economic blueprint, promised for January 21st, would not be finished until--perhaps--March; reform of the health-care system, promised for sometime during the first 100 days, may not be finalised until the end of the year. In themselves, these delays might not have caused too much fuss. But they came amid a slew of campaign pledges suddenly bent or broken.
Perhaps the most glaring of these concerned Haiti (see page 42). During the campaign Mr Clinton had condemned the Bush administration's policy of turning back Haitian boat people at sea. But when he learnt that as many as 10,000 Haitians had taken him seriously and were building a ramshackle flotilla to carry them to Miami, Mr Clinton decided ""temporarily"" to continue Mr Bush's policy.
This was sensible. But coming at the same time as hints that Mr Clinton was changing his mind in favour of a petrol tax, sidling away from a tax cut for the middle class, shrinking from a cut of 25% in the White House staff and, perhaps, finding a way other than his promised executive order to allow homosexuals in the armed forces, it kicked up a storm of bad publicity policy or to those to whom he had promised jobs) and his prickly response to being held to account for what he has said, all shed light on what may prove to be real weaknesses in a Clinton presidency.
To those who have followed Mr Clinton closely, these weaknesses are well known. The transition only made them more visible. Mr Clinton got elected by selling himself as ""the man with the plan"". Now that he is in the White House, the question is not just whether he can deliver on the details, but where the plan has gone to.",True,

  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">In America's mid-term elections, the Democrats won the House of Representatives for the first time in a decade.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">They gained a firm majority, helped by a surge in support from white women and from voters aged under 30.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Just under a quarter of the new House will be female.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Two Muslim women and two Native American women won seats, a first for both groups.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Nancy Pelosi said she would stand for Speaker, again, but has said she would be a "transitional" figure.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A good night for the Democrats in the House wasn't replicated in the Senate, where the Republicans increased their majority by picking up Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and probably Florida.</span>

  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Beto O'Rourke, the darling of the Democrats, narrowly failed to unseat Ted Cruz in Texas.</span>

  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Stacey Abrams was reluctant to concede in a tight race in Georgia in which she hoped to become that state's first black governor.</span>

  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Among the many ballot initiatives in the states, Florida's voters passed a law that restores voting rights to former prisoners.</span>

  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Donald Trump sacked Jeff Sessions as attorney-general.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Mr Sessions had attracted the president's ire for recusing himself from overseeing the special counsel's investigation into Russian meddling in elections.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Mr Trump replaced him on an interim basis with Matt Whitaker, a critic of that investigation.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Penalty kicks
After pulling out of a nuclear deal with Iran earlier in the year, America's most punishing sanctions on the country came into effect, aiming to cripple its already struggling economy.</span>

  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">France vowed to help European firms defy the sanctions.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Saudi members of a team assisting the Turkish authorities investigate the killing of Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month were accused of trying to remove evidence.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Despite America's call for peace talks, the war in Yemen escalated, as forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition advanced on rebel positions in the port city of Hodeida.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">More than 150 people are reported to have been killed in the past week.</span>

  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">un investigators found more than 200 mass graves in Iraq containing between 6,000 and 12,000 bodies.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The graves date from 2014 to 2017, when the jihadists of Islamic State ran the territory that is under investigation.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">From judge to politician
Sérgio Moro, a Brazilian judge who has been leading the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigations of corruption among politicians, accepted an offer from the country's rightist president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, to lead a new "super-ministry" of justice and public security.</span>

  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A jury was selected for the trial in New York of Joaquín Guzmán, also known as El Chapo (Shorty), the former leader of Mexico's Sinaloa drug gang.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Mr Guzmán escaped twice from prison, most recently in 2015, when he tunnelled out of a maximum-security jail.</span>

  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Ecuador's supreme court ordered the country's former president, Rafael Correa, to stand trial on charges that he participated in a failed plot to kidnap an opposition congressmanin 2012.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Mr Correa has been living in Belgium since he left office in 2017.</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">He denies wrongdoing.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Caving in to violence
The government of Pakistan gave in to mass protests by Islamist agitators and barred Asia Bibi, a Christian woman recently acquitted of blasphemy, from leaving the country.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">A few days later, however, it ordered her release from prison.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Her precise whereabouts are unknown.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Voters in New Caledonia chose for the Pacific island to remain part of France, rather than become independent.</span>

  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Australia's government bowed to criticism from humanrights groups and said it would move refugee children and their families from a detention centre it operates in Nauru to Australia itself.</span>

  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">China's president, Xi Jinping, and his American counterpart, Donald Trump, held their first publicly disclosed telephone conversation in six months.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Mr Trump described it as "long and very good", and said it had covered the two countries' trade conflict as well as North Korea.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">China's foreign ministry said the call was "positive".</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Army dreamers
Emmanuel Macron used a speech at Verdun, part of the extensive commemorative events surrounding the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended the first world war, to call for the creation of a "true European army".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Commentators scrambled to decipher exactly what the French president meant by that.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A former Nazi concentrationcamp guard went on trial in Germany at the age of 94.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">A 69-year-old Dutchman launched a legal case to change his age to 49, arguing that the law already allows him to change his name and gender.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">He apparently wants to improve his dating prospects.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">1
Robyn Denholm was named as the new chairman of Tesla, as part of a deal with regulators under which Elon Musk is relinquishing the role at the electric-car manufacturer.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Ms Denholm is the chief financial officer at Telstra, an Australian telecoms firm.</span>

  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Active consumers
As it prepares for Singles' Day, the world's biggest shopping event, on November 11th, Alibaba posted a solid rise in quarterly net profit, to 20bn yuan ($2.9bn).</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The Chinese e-commerce company now boasts 601m "active consumers".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Amazon reported a much lower customer base the last time it released such figures.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">SoftBank reported a big jump in quarterly net profit, to ¥526.4bn ($4.6bn).</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">That was mostly due to returns from technology investments in its Vision Fund.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The Japanese conglomerate has had to face some awkward questions about the Saudi money that is backing the fund since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Its share price has fallen by a fifth following the killing of the Saudi journalist, allegedly by Saudi government operatives.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The political manoeuvring continued in the trade war between America and China.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Wang Qishan, a senior Chinese official, indicated that Beijing was ready for a discussion about "mutual concerns" with Washington.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">That came after President Xi Jinping lashed out at what he described as international trade's "law of the jungle".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Mr Xi and Donald Trump are expected to discuss how they might end their stand-off when they meet at the do summit this month.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">American prosecutors brought criminal charges against two former bankers at Goldman Sachs and a Malaysian financier in connection with the alleged misappropriation of funds from Malaysia's imdb development fund (one of the bankers has pleaded guilty).</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Goldman said it was co-operating with the Department of Justice's continuing investigation and acknowledged that the proceedings could result in significant fines or sanctions against the bank.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it had repurchased $928mworth of its shares in August, its first buy-back in six years.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Warren Buffett's investment company has not completed a takeover in nearly three years.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Spotify, a music-streaming service, announced a $1bn buy-back of its own.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The share prices of Italian banks came under renewed pressure, ahead of a deadline for the Italian government to submit a revised budget that meets eu rules.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Italy's big banks did better than many of their European counterparts in the recent stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">But questions remain about how tough those tests really are.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">On the other hand
A remark by the governor of the Bank ofJapan, Haruhiko Kuroda, that it was no longer appropriate to implement "a large-scale policy to overcome deflation" was taken as the clearest indication yet that he is minded to move on from the central bank's enormous stimulus programme and start tightening monetary policy.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Mr Kuroda hedged his comments, however, and said he would keep interest rates extremely low for the foreseeable future.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">American employers added 250,000 people to the payrolls in October, the 97th consecutive month of jobs growth.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the lowest it has been since the late 1960s.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Pay grew at the fastest pace, year on year, since April 2009, though that was in part because it bounced back from a low base in October 2017, when wages were unusually depressed following a big hurricane.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Buoyed by higher oil prices, Rosneft reported a 150% rise in net profit for the third quarter compared with the same three months last year, to 142bn roubles ($2.2bn).</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Russia's biggest oil company also benefited from being able to increase production, owing to an agreement between opec and Russia in June that eased restrictions on output.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Quality, not quantity
Apple's share price struggled to recover from the drubbing it received after it downgraded its outlook for the all-important final three months of the year, which includes the Christmas shopping season.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The company also said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sells, unsettling investors who have come to rely on those figures as a gauge of Apple's health.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">It says unit sales are less relevant.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In the latest quarter, for example, Apple sold 47m iPhones.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Although that was similar to the same period last year, revenue from iPhone sales soared by 29% because it was shifting dearer devices.</span>

  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The Latinobarómetro survey 
 Latin Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with politics in their countries .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">That is cause for worry 
 DEMOCRACY IN LATIN AMERICA is in trouble .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">That is the message of this year 's survey of opinion in 18 countries by Latinobarómetro , a pollster based in Santiago , Chile .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The proportion of people who are dissatisfied with how democracy works has jumped from 51 % in 2009 to 71 % .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The share that is content has dropped from 44 % to 24 % , its lowest level since the survey began more than two decades ago ( see chart 1and chart 2 on next page ) .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">That does not mean most Latin Americans are ready to dump democracy , which has become the norm across the region only since the 1980s .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">More than half say that it is better than any other system , though that has dropped by 13 percentage points over the past eight years .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Disillusioned democrats lean towards indifference .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The share who are neutral has risen from 16 % in 2010 to 28 % , while support for authoritarian government is steady , at about 15 % .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">" People do n't like the democracy they are experiencing , " says Marta Lagos , the head of Latinobarómetro .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">In Latin America 's two biggest countries , Brazil and Mexico , that sentiment has resulted in the election of presidents this year who until recently would have been widely considered too radical to lead their countries .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">If disillusionment deepens , future elections could bring presidents who test the region 's democratic norms .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Since last November nine countries have either re - elected presidents or chosen new ones .</span>
  <span class="pos4" style="background-color: #1a9850;">Most of these elections were free and fair but there were notable exceptions .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Venezuela 's president , Nicolás Maduro , had his term in office extended in a rigged vote in May.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Juan Orlando Hernández 's reelection in Honduras last November was widely seen as flawed .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Cuba simply transferred power from one dictator to another in April .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Most Latin Americans , though , live in countries where their votes are counted accurately .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">That does not mean they are happy , as Latinobarómetro 's 20,000 interviews , conducted from midJune to early August this year , make clear .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Voters have many reasons to grumble .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Growth in gdp per person has dropped sharply since the global financial crisis in 2009 .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Venezuela 's economy has imploded and Brazil 's suffered its worst - ever recession from 2014 to 2016 .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The perception that income is distributed justly has plunged from 25 % in 2013 to 16 % .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">That belief may be wrong ; the Gini coefficient , a measure of inequality , has been dropping in the biggest countries .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">But , at an individual level , a person 's perception of inequality is among the strongest predictors of his or her dissatisfaction with democracy .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Economic worries are at the top of citizens ' concerns in most countries .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Only in Venezuela do more than half the people say they do not have enough to eat .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The regional average , though , is a still startling 27 % .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Crime is the second main gripe , leading the list of worries even in some relatively safe countries , such as Chile and Uruguay .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Corruption is another big complaint .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Eighteen former presidents and vice - presidents have been implicated in corruption scandals , including in Argentina , Brazil , Ecuador and Peru .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The share of Latin Americans who think their countries are going in the wrong direction exceeds the proportion who think they are progressing by eight points , the largest negative gap since 1995 .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">This has battered the credibility of institutions .</span>
  <span class="pos4" style="background-color: #1a9850;">Only the armed forces and the church , powerful institutions before the advent of mass democracy , retain much respect ( see chart 3 ) .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Half of Latin Americans believe that all or almost all presidents and legislators are involved in corruption .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">The share of people who think the elites govern for their own benefit has risen steadily over the past decade ; nowhere does it fall below 60 % .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Increasingly , voters are disengaged from politics .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">For the third year running , the number who say they will vote for no political party is bigger than the number who say they will vote for one .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Poor people are more alienated than the rich and middle class .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">People who are badly off lag behind prosperous folk by more than ten percentage points in their level of support for democracy .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The young are more sceptical than the old , which bodes ill for democracy 's future .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Some 200 m Latin Americans with low levels of education , about 30 % of the total , are the voters most prone to lash out at established politicians and parties , and to choose leaders who promise to solve problems with a " magic wand " , writes Latinobarómetro in an analytical note accompanying the results .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The survey , which has a margin of error of 3 % per country , is published exclusively by The Economist .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In Brazil , where satisfaction with democracy is lowest among the 18 countries , disillusionment opened the way for Jair Bolsonaro , to win the presidency last month .</span>
  <span class="pos5" style="background-color: #006837;color: white">Jair Bolsonaro had strong support from well - educated Brazilians .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In July Mexico elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador , a populist of the left whose Morena party fought its first election in 2015 .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">No fan of dictatorship , he proposes to change the way democracy works by handing more decisions to voters through referendums .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Ms Lagos worries that democracy in Argentina is vulnerable .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Its economy is heading into recession and the share of people who call themselves middle class dropped by 14 points from 2013 to 2018 , the biggest such decline in the region .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">In countries whose leaders are dismantling democracy , citizens appreciate it more .</span>
  <span class="pos4" style="background-color: #1a9850;">Although just 12 % of Venezuelans are happy with how their " democracy " functions , 75 % prefer democracy to any other system .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">In Nicaragua , where the increasingly dictatorial regime of Daniel Ortega has been repressing protests since April , satisfaction with democracy plunged from 52 % last year to 20 % , but more than half of the people still support the system .</span>
  <span class="pos5" style="background-color: #006837;color: white">Encouragingly , good governance also bolsters support for democracy .</span>
  <span class="pos5" style="background-color: #006837;color: white">Prosperous Uruguay , Costa Rica and Chile , where the rule of law is relatively well established , are the countries most satisfied with how democracy works 
 The best hope for shoring it up rests with leaders who do not claim to possess magic wands .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Several have recently taken office .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">They include Lenín Moreno in Ecuador and Martín Vizcarra in Peru , who have embarked on campaigns against corruption .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Sebastián Piñera , Chile 's centre - right president since March , is trying to reform the economy and social programmes .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The centre - left president of Costa Rica , Carlos Alvarado , defeated a fundamentalist Christian and is trying to fix the tax system .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Iván Duque , Colombia 's conservative president , is just getting started .</span>
  <span class="pos5" style="background-color: #006837;color: white">If they are successful , they will boost democracy 's approval ratings as well as their own .</span>

RIO DE JANEIRO
Female MCS are changing the genre
CAROLINA DE OLIVEIRA LOURENÇO first heard the word "feminism" in 2015 from friends who were taking Brazil's college entrance exam, on which a question about it appeared.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">She was 22, and a rising star in the world of carioca funk, throbbing syncopated dance music born in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A year later, MC Carol, as she is known, released a song called "100% Feminista".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The lyrics describe her tough childhood: "I was five but I already understood/that a woman gets hit if she doesn't make food," she rapped.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">It was a hit.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">That did not stop nasty comments on social media about her appearance.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">"It's not just hard to be a woman singing funk," says MC Carol, who calls herself black and fat.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"It's hard to be a woman, period."</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Funk, which has roots in American hip hop, is performed mostly by men.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Its critics say its lyrics promote misogyny, promiscuity and crime.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">In 2017 20,000 Brazilians signed a petition calling on congress to declare it-along with bailes funk, massive dances where the music is played at earsplitting volume-a public-health violation.</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">(The legislature refused.) A particular target is funk proibidão (taboo funk), in which explicit lyrics both glorify and lament violence.</span>
  <span class="pos4" style="background-color: #1a9850;">Funk ostentaçâo (ostentation funk), which celebrates money and fame, is especially popular in São Paulo.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">MC Carol's mission, and that of other feminist funkeiras, is not to make the style less rude but to bring to it women's viewpoints.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">MC (a hip-hop title derived from "master of ceremonies") Carol started out singing putaria, a subgenre of proibidāo that's about sex.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Some songs by women are frankly feminist.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In the music video for "Nāo Sou Obrigada" ("I Don't Have To"), which appears on Spotify's Global Viral 50 list, MC Pocahontas chides her dopey boyfriend for bossing her around.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In "Cai de Boca" ("Drop Your Mouth"), a putaria hit from 2018, MC Rebecca sings about men performing oral sex on women.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A hair stylist and samba dancer from the favela Morro Sāo Joāo, she says the song is a call for sexual liberation in a world where "women are still seen as submissive".</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Female funk performers and their messages bring new life to the subgenre "coNSCientious funk", says Andressa Oliveira of Liga do Funk, a group in São Paulo that trains artists.</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">It draws some of its energy from opposition to Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has aggressively conservative views on social issues.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">MC Rebecca, who came out as bisexual on Twitter, wrapped herself in a rainbow flag in a music video.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Women are listening.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">ONErpm, a company that represents artists in negotiations with digital platforms, looked at data from YouTube for around 130 funk channels.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">It found that women are now 49.5% of the audience, up from 32% in 2014.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">Female stars are giving Brazilian funk global appeal.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Larissa Machado, who calls herself Anitta, started out in a church choir, made her name in Rio's funk scene and now has 37m Instagram followers, many of them abroad.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The video for "Vai Malandra" (roughly, "Go Hustler"), which was filmed in a Rio favela, has been viewed 352m times on YouTube.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Anitta refused to airbrush out the cellulite on her thighs, delighting women.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">"Vai Malandra" is the first Portuguese-language song to reach Spotify's Global Top 50 list.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">That brought a singing gig with Madonna.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Kamilla Fialho, whose marketing company, K2L, helped shape Anitta's early career, compares her success to that of Beyoncé and Rihanna, who are politically active and flaunt their sexual empowerment.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Her company is now coaching MC Rebecca by providing English lessons, among other things.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Ms Fialho is not encouraging the young funkeira to stay away from the subject of sex.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">"If you want polite music, listen to classical," she says.</span>

WHEN PEOPLE vote with their feet, they usually make an informed choice.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Venezuelans, for example, have many compelling reasons to leave Venezuela.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Its government admits that it killed 5,287 people last year for "resistance to authority", inflation has reached as high as 2,700,000% and by early 2018 the average person had lost 11kg (24.lb) from hunger.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Perhaps 13% of the population have fled-over 4m people.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Citizens of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are also emigrating en masse.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">They are fed up with poverty and violence, and people-smugglers have become adept at transporting them.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">This exodus is the main reason why in the past year officers at the United States' southern border have detained more people trying to cross than in any 12-month period since 2009.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Venezuela and Central America are uniquely troubled.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">However, their citizens' desire to get out is increasingly common.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Gallup, a pollster, asks people in 120 countries each year if they want to emigrate.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">From 2010 to 2018 the share that said "yes" rose in 15 of the 19 Latin American nations it tracks.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In 2010, 19% of people in the region hoped to move abroad permanently, the same as in Europe.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Now 31% do, as many as in the Middle East and Africa.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Many are afraid of being killed.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">In Brazil murders hit a record high of 63,880 in 2017, following a resurgence of fighting between criminal gangs; the share of citizens who wish to emigrate has tripled to 33%.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The country's homicide rate is now roughly level with Colombia's-where it fell as the government's war with the FARC guerrillas wound down, but could pick up again if some fighters' recent decision to abandon the peace accord of 2016 causes a return to war (see Americas section).</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In countries where crime has not risen, economic doldrums have been the main driver of discontent.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">In 2010 Latin America's GDP grew by 6%, well above the global average.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">By 2016 it was shrinking, due to recessions in Brazil and Argentina-the latter of which imposed capital controls this week (see Finance section).</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">In Mexico, the region's second-biggest country, the economy has plodded along with low productivity growth and little social mobility.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Another thing making Latin America less liveable is corruption.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">The region is grubbier than you would expect, given its relative affluence.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">In Brazil the Lava Jato investigation has exposed bribes paid by industrial firms to scores of politicians.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Alan García, a former president of Peru, killed himself in April to avoid arrest in conjunction with the Brazilian scandal.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">According to Latinobarómetro, an annual survey, the share of Latin Americans dissatisfied with how democracy works in their country has risen from 52% in 2010 to 71% last year.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Latin Americans are not just voting with their feet; they are venting at the ballot box, too.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">In 2018 messianic populists who railed against corruption and crime won presidential elections in Brazil (the conservative Jair Bolsonaro) and Mexico (the leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador).</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">If voters remain this disenchanted, more leaders with autocratic streaks are likely to follow.</span>

  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Emerging markets
Most, but not all, emerging markets have overcome high inflation
THIS YEAR marked a quarter of a century since Brazil beat hyperinflation with a conjuring trick.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The old currency, the cruzeiro, had been debased, suffering annual price rises reaching 2,500%.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Following the advice of a small group of economists, the government required firms to list prices and wages in "units of real value", a new unit of account linked loosely to the dollar.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Cruzeiros-ever more of them-continued to be used for payment, with the exchange rate between the unit and the currency widely publicised.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Eventually the authorities simply scrapped the cruzeiro, replacing it with the freshly-minted "real", which by then was a trusted yardstick.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Inflation tumbled to 22% in 1995.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">It seemed like a miracle.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Yet arguably what came next, both in Brazil and other emerging markets, was more remarkable still.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">Since then, many emerging-market economies have defeated not just hyperinflation but high inflation too.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">In 1995 median inflation among emerging markets was over 10%.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">By 2017 it was only 3.3%.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Exclude crisis-struck Turkey and Argentina, and at the start of 2019 the gap between average inflation in emerging markets and advanced economies was at a record low (see chart).</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">In Brazil today inflation is just 3.4%.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">This longer, slower miracle was achieved using rich-world methods but in harsher conditions.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">By the 1990s, and especially after a speculative attack on Thailand's currency in 1997 sparked a financial crisis in Asia, emerging markets were moving away from the old monetary paradigm of fixed exchange rates.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">At the end of the decade they began to embrace inflation targets.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The first to transition was Poland in 1999, followed by Brazil in 1999, South Africa in 2000, Hungary in 2001 and the Philippines in 2002.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Today 24 emerging markets have inflation-targeting central banks.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">On average they have been a clear success.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Inflation has fallen, as has its volatility.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Prices still rise faster than in the rich world but targets are also higher: typically closer to 5% than the 2% advanced-economy norm.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Yet the landscape is varied.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">In countries like Chile, with transparent central banks, low public debt and high openness to trade, inflation expectations are pinned down.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In others, like India, with higher public debt and less credible institutions, they remain volatile.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">And emerging markets still provide the main exceptions to global disinflation, including Argentina and Turkey, where inflation is running at 54% and 15% respectively.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">This variation is one reason why there is not much head-scratching about low inflation in emerging markets.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Another is that fewer central banks than in the rich world-a little more than half of the total- are undershooting their targets.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">And monetary policymakers are not pressed up against the lower bound on interest rates, at which low inflation becomes a greater threat.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">But this poses its own problem.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Higher rates make emerging markets potentially attractive sources of yield for richworld portfolio investors, who tend to be fickle.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Capital flowing in and out can send exchange rates haywire, affecting not only inflation but also trade and financial stability.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">In such an environment anchored inflation expectations take on more importance.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">They make the response of inflation to exchange-rate fluctuations transient and less severe, thereby allowing central banks to focus on the health of their economies.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Last year the IMF found that from 2011 to 2015 monetary policy reacted more to local economic conditions in emerging markets where inflation expectations were better anchored.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">That was particularly helpful during the "taper tantrum" of 2013, in which the prospect of less quantitative easing in America sent many emerging-market currencies tumbling.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Dollar dilemma
The trouble is that the exchange rate partly determines the local economic conditions to which central banks must respond.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">As well as boosting inflation, a cheaper currency makes it harder for emerging-market corporations that have borrowed in dollars to service their debts.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">These dollar debts have grown from 14% to 20% of GDP since 2009, on average.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">And although in theory a falling exchange rate should at least boost exports, this effect is limited by the fact that so much trade is invoiced in dominant currencies like the dollar or the euro.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Research by Gita Gopinath and Emine Boz of the IMF and Mikkel Plagborg-Møller of Princeton University has found that a strong dollar tends to gum up world trade, as well as making dollar debts harder to repay.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">As a result, even emerging markets with independent central banks and floating exchange rates can appear to be at the mercy of international financial conditions, in particular the policy of the Federal Reserve.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Certainly many still mimic the Fed.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">As of August, 13 emerging-market central banks had followed the Fed's interest-rate rises in 2018 and cuts in 2019.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Several, such as Indonesia and Thailand, raised rates in 2018 even with inflation well under control.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">And many continue to intervene directly in currency markets, accumulating and running down foreign-exchange reserves even as they maintain a notional commitment to floating exchange rates.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"The textbook version of the inflation-targeting framework is obviously too narrow for emerging-market-economy central banks," said Agustín Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements and former governor of the Bank of Mexico, in May.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">That casts some doubt on the simple story that inflation targeting in emerging markets has been a triumph for conventional economics.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">What is more, it is uncertain how secure emerging markets' low inflation is.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Three factors threaten it: the strength of institutions, fiscal policy and the global environment.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">One of the curiosities of the rich world's low inflation is that it has coincided with the rise of populism.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Yet it is only in emerging markets, specifically in Argentina and Turkey, that institutional weakness has led to runaway prices.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In Argentina President Mauricio Macri's government tried to establish inflation-targeting at the central bank in 2017, but a series of missteps hurt its credibility before a weakening of Mr Macri's re-election prospects caused a further run on the currency.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Turkey has an inflation-targeting central bank but it has come under relentless attack from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claims, wrongly, that higher interest rates cause inflation.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Not all populists have laid siege to their central bank.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised not to interfere with the Bank of Mexico.</span>
  <span class="pos4" style="background-color: #1a9850;">In Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's Chicago-educated economy minister Paulo Guedes has defended the independence of the central bank, and the legislature is considering granting it formal independence.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Still, emerging-markets institutions are clearly more vulnerable to populists than the rich world's.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Even in India, where the central bank is older than the republic, the head of the central bank resigned in December 2018 after a string of conflicts with the government, which pressed for looser policies and a large bite of the central bank's capital.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Fiscal policy is the second worry.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Unlike in advanced economies, budget-balancing played an important role in emerging markets' battle against inflation.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Their government debt peaked at over 70% of GDP in the mid-1990s.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">By the eve of the financial crisis in 2007 it was down to about half that.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">This was partly just luck.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">A commodities boom boosted growth and filled government coffers, creating space for central banks to establish credibility, says Guillermo Tolosa of Oxford Economics, a consultancy.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">It soothed worries about so-called "fiscal dominance", when governments are tempted to inflate away their debt problems.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Since then, however, debt has been rising again.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">It is forecast to average 53% of GDP this year, and 60% of GDP by 2024.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Mr Tolosa is unworried, pointing out that even in Brazil, which has a huge hole in its budget caused by public pensions, inflation expectations are under control.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">But others, such as the World Bank, have issued warnings about debt.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Although economists are revising up their estimates of the debt that advanced economies can bear in a world of low interest rates, the same argument does not apply in emerging markets, where rates are higher and investors flightier.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The final factor is the external environment.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Those who champion inflation-targeting reject the idea that emerging markets' disinflation is a result of global factors rather than better economic policy.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">That is surely right when looking at the long-term trend.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">But because inflation expectations are less anchored in emerging markets, the short term matters quite a bit.</span>
  <span class="pos4" style="background-color: #1a9850;">In that respect today's global disinflationary environment surely helps.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">So whereas the rich world might breathe a sigh of relief were global inflation to rise, it would not benefit emerging markets.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">And higher inflation in America would probably mean higher interest rates there and hence disruptive capital flight.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The upshot is that emerging markets must remain more vigilant about inflation than the rich world.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">They have not yet reached the point where more inflation looks desirable.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">That is true only in advanced economies, and calls for its own policy agenda.</span>

DELHI, LEXINGTON AND SÂO PAULO
Teenagers are rewriting the rules of news
The president of El Salvador gets it.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Addressing the un General Assembly in September, Nayib Bukele paused to take a self-portrait at the rostrum.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">"Believe me, many more people will see that selfie once I share it than will listen to this speech," he said, adding, "I hope I took a good one."</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Marianne Williamson, a New-Agey type running for the Democratic presidential nomination in America, gets it.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Asked after a debate in July whether it went well, she replied that she would only know for sure "later, when I see the memes".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">So does Andrew Yang, another Democratic no-hoper.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">His first big interview was with Joe Rogan, an internet-famous comedian with 6.96m subscribers on YouTube.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">After it was viewed im times over the course of two days, Mr Yang wrote that his campaign could be divided into "br (Before Rogan) and ar (After Rogan)".</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">These minor politicians provide a pithy summary of how teenagers and those in their early 20s consume news today.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">It is almost entirely on social media.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">It is almost entirely visual.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">And the content of the news-"President Makes Speech at un"-ís less important than how it is packaged.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">It is often filtered through humour or comment.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Or, just as often, it is mediated by personalities who command huge followings among young people but are little known to the general population.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">These principles hold true around the world, even if the specifics and platforms differ.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Between 2009 and 2018 the share of teenagers who read newspapers declined from around 60% to close to 20%, according to the Programme for International Student Assessment (pisa), an educational league table of 15- and 16-year-olds in the oecd, a group of mostly rich countries.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Young Indians are half as likely to visit timesofindia.com, India's biggest Englishlanguage news site, as older ones; they are also far more interested in videos and Bollywood news.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">In Britain, younger teens are far less familiar with the bbc's brand than they are with those of YouTube or Netflix.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">The public broadcaster "will face a threat to its future sustainability if it cannot engage young people sufficiently" according to Ofcom, the country's media regulator.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Some 80% of Arabs aged 18-24 years old now get their news from social media, up from 25% in 2015.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">They favour Facebook, though the Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, are captivated by Snapchat.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Twothirds of South Korean teenagers go online to find out what is happening in the world, and of them, 97% turn to Naver, a portal and search engine.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">According to Pew Research Centre, 95% of American teens have access to a smartphone and 45% are online "almost constantly".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A study of American and British teens commissioned by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in Oxford argues that when it comes to news, young people are most concerned with "what it can do for them as individuals-rather than society as a whole".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">It can be tempting to dismiss teenagers' news-consumption habits.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Most cannot vote, have limited spending power and are probably incapable of finding El Salvador on a map.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Such sneers are misplaced.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A third of the planet is under 20.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">More than half the world is now connected to the internet.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The young are a proxy for the future.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">That is especially the case in media businesses, where their habits drive billiondollar decisions, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and its failed attempt to buy Snapchat the following year.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Teenagers understand that technology gives them outsized power.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Greta Thunberg, a teenage activist in Sweden, started the global "school strike for climate" which has now spread to 150 countries.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Protests led by students, some still in high school, have erupted across the world, from Hong Kong to Chile.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Politicians, policymakers and media executives should pay attention: how news is made, spread and consumed by teenagers today will determine what happens to their countries and businesses tomorrow.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">As one 13-year-old told Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an American lawmaker, "I'm not old enough to vote yet, but I can follow you on Instagram!"</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">To best understand this future, look to America.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">It has the world's most vibrant media ecosystem and is home to most of the platforms used by youth around the world, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">(TikTok, wildly popular with younger teens, is Chinese and strictly moderated for political content.) American media wield influence around the world and are widely aped: the New York Times boasts readers everywhere; websites such as BuzzFeed have inspired similar clickbait sites in dozens of countries.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">And America's political and cultural vocabulary is pervasive.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">A meme that starts there has a good chance of spreading throughout the world.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The arena for those memes has changed.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Since the 2016 presidential election in America Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role as a platform for news distribution.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">But to many Western teenagers the social network is deeply uncool.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">It is for old people.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Nor do many of them hang out on Twitter, which plays an outsized role in journalism and politics only because it is full of journalists and politicians (and Donald Trump).</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">They have little time for youth-focused websites such as BuzzFeed either.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">"It's clearly adults trying to relate to young people," says Victoria, a 16-year-old in Kentucky.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Teenagers deride outlets that just a few years ago were hailed as the next big thing: Griffin, a 16year-old from the Chinese city of Wuxi, dismisses Jinri Toutiao ("Today's Headlines"), China's most popular news app with 120m daily users, as clickbait for adults.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The action has shifted to Instagram (owned by Facebook), WhatsApp (ditto) and YouTube (owned by Google), each of which has well over a billion users.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">(Snapchat is popular in America but less so elsewhere.) Pew reports that 85% of American teenagers use YouTube; more than 70% use Instagram.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Common Sense, an American non-profit group, found in a recent study that 69% of American teens watch online videos every day, mostly on YouTube.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">They spend nearly seven and a half hours a day looking at screens of all kinds.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Instagram is an odd destination for those seeking the news.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Users post pictures to their "grid", mostly pretty ones.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The app allows only one link per account-in the bio.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">And it has no formal reposting mechanism.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">But the introduction of "Stories" in 2016, which allowed its users to post shortlived images with annotations, added text to a largely visual platform, made sharing and reposting easier and supercharged its growth.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Stories also allow those with more than 10,000 followers to share links to other material.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Where users went, so did those who hope to influence them: advertisers, marketers, politicians, propagandists and miscellaneous mischief-makers have all piled into Instagram.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Consider the Amazon.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">By late August, anyone with an Instagram account anywhere in the world would have known that "the Amazon rain forest-the lungs which produces 20% of our planet's oxygen-is on fire," as Emmanuel Macron, France's president, put it in a post on August 22nd that was liked by nearly 200,000 people.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">On the same day National Geographies account, the 11th-most followed on Instagram (126m followers), posted about fires in the Amazon, as did Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, 38m); Prilly Latuconsina (an Indonesian actress, 32m); and Malaika Arora (an Indian model, 10 m).</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Two days later nasa (51m) fanned the Instagram flames with a fresh satellite image.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">This is fine
Posts about Amazonian fires were soon inescapable-as were allegations that big news outlets were ignoring it.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"It's the only thing I saw for weeks," says Dylan, a 17year-old pupil in Lexington, Kentucky.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">"Whatever I saw about the Amazon I would share it," says Stacy, a 15-year-old Bostonian.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Unscrupulous accounts tried to take advantage of the disaster, asking for donations or promising to plant a tree for every "like".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The world's press subsequently ran articles, many of which debunked falsehoods on Instagram, such as Mr Macron's assertion that the Amazon produces 20% of the world's oxygen.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In interviews conducted by The Economist with two dozen teens in Lexington, Kentucky and Boston, every one of them mentioned the fires unprompted.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"The fires in the Amazon were not getting very much coverage," says Olivia Seltzer, a 15-year-old Californian who two years ago started The Cramm, a newsletter for teenagers that goes out on Instagram and via email and text message.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">There is "a lot of frustration that these kinds of stories aren't heard about.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">A lot of young people are taking it on to themselves to inform their peers."</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">News outlets native to Instagram are also springing up.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Not everything they cover is serious.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">@nowthisnews (2m followers) combines text overlaid on brief video clips about everything from political protests in Hong Kong to a dog with a tail on its head.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">(It also publishes on other platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.) @houseofhighlights (15m) is dedicated to clips of American sports.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">In 2015 it was acquired by Bleacher Report, a large sports news website.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Both accounts are in the top ten on Instagram for engagement, as measured by the number of likes and comments accrued, according to Axios, another news website.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"We've had the distinct advantage that we've never tried to take something that worked in a legacy medium and force fit it into the digital age," says Howard Mittman, Bleacher's ceo.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Other outlets, he says, are like the "divorced uncle who bought the right convertible in the wrong colour, who has cool clothes, but they just don't look good on him".</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Another hugely popular Instagram-native outlet is @theshaderoom (17m), which deals mostly in celebrity news and gossip (though it also posted about the Amazon fires).</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">If tmz upended traditional celebrity reporting in the era of the blog, @theshaderoom is doing it again on social media.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Sometimes the streams cross.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">"I was scrolling a post about Cardi B"-a singer with 56m followers-"and the comments were like, 'Why aren't you talking about the Amazon?'</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">" says Jaliyah, a 15-year-old in Boston.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Young people are "very complicated in how they're consuming media", says Samhita Mukhopadhyay, the executive editor of Teen Vogue.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"They can kind of toggle between Justin Bieber and they want to know exactly what Greta Thunberg is doing and they will show up to the rally."</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In the Arab world memes use cartoons or screen grabs from old movies to make light of political grimness.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Elsewhere thousands of accounts changed their profile pictures this summer to a deep blue or striking red-the former to raise awareness about protests in Sudan and the latter to 1 tell people about the political situation in Kashmir.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">"Activism has become one of the easiest ways to project yourself as cool," says Sadie, another Lexington teen.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">It is not uncommon to scroll through Instagram and find out about a high-profile divorce and a roiling protest in some remote corner of the world within the span of one second.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">This weird mix of celebrities, politics and activism is another feature of modern news on social media: "news" now comes not only from accounts and outlets dedicated to the dissemination of journalism, but could be anything from a meme to the opinion of an online personality, such as PewDiePie, the world's most influential YouTuber, who mostly makes silly videos about video games and online culture.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">For five years he had the largest number of followers on the video-sharing platform, until he was overtaken by т-Series, an Indian record label, in April 2019.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">He is now second, with 102m subscribers.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The combined print and digital circulation of every newspaper in America is about 30m.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Daksha, a 13-year-old in Kentucky, spends her spare time making memes and posting them to a PewDiePie-themed community on Reddit, looking for the "satisfaction that Lord PewDiePie reacted to my meme" on his channel, she says.</span>

Sarah, 16, from Kentucky, says that "every boy on the debate team is into Ben Shapiro," a conservative controversialist with 876,000 subscribers on YouTube.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In Germany a YouTuber called Rezo (1.16m subscribers) went viral with a rant against old and rich people and particularly the Christian Democratic Union, the party of Angela Merkel.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Felipe Neto, a Brazilian YouTuber (35m) earns 30m reais a year ($7.5m).</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">He started out telling jokes to adolescents but has evolved into a fierce critic of Jair Bolsonaro, the president.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">In September he made headlines for distributing 14,000 gayfriendly books at Rio de Janeiro's book fair after the city's evangelical mayor censored a graphic novel that featured a gay hero.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Teenagers are, in short, getting their news from other young people who largely express their personal opinions and are barely any better informed than themselves.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">As Mr Mittman puts it, teen news consumers are looking for "a level of authenticity that allows you to know that they're speaking to you".</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Other teenagers say they get their news from clips of late-night tv hosts, such as Trevor Noah or Stephen Colbert, or from stand-up comedians like Hasan Minhaj, who has a popular show on Netflix.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Personalities are replacing news organisations.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">"I feel like it's boring if it's an article.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">But if it's a video it's super engaging," says Dioneilys, 16, in Boston.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">That opens the door to partisanship and misinformation.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The Amazon-fire posts from the summer were riddled with errors.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Personalities like PewDiePie and other YouTubers are routinely accused of making inflammatory comments or pulling tasteless stunts.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Memes often bear little relation to fact.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Many teens say they know all this but are sanguine about the dubious origins of their news.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Sheer repetition is enough to convince some.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"I don't believe anything I read on social media," says Jaliyah in Boston.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"Unless it keeps coming, then maybe."</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Others believe information if it comes from verified accounts.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">But many trust it as long as it comes from their friends.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Many Brazilians "immediately believe in the authenticity of audio sent via WhatsApp by someone they know", while furrowing their brows at a tape leaked to Folha de S.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Paulo, a major newspaper, says Joel Pinheiro da Fonseca, a 34-year-old columnist for Folha.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Realising that few young people were reading his column (or indeed any other section of his newspaper), Mr Pinheiro started a YouTube channel, where fans comment on his shaggy hair or home furnishings as often as on his political analysis.</span>
  <span class="pos5" style="background-color: #006837;color: white">"To them, the rudimentary quality makes it more authentic," he says.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">"Young people want to establish a relationship with their sources of information."</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">One consequence of a reliance on personalities is that the platforms on which they appear rather than publications become the sources of news.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">"When your starting position is social-WhatsApp, Instagram, whatever-your loyalty to any given publisher is much lower," says Satyan Gajwani, who runs the digital arm of the Times Group, India's biggest media conglomerate.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">More than half a billion people visit its digital properties every month; more than 100m do so every day.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">"How do we build enough confidence and trust in them that they become brand-loyal?"</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">he asks.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Manvi, a 15-year-old in Delhi, exemplifies his worry.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Her family subscribes to two Times Group newspapers but online she reads whatever "pops up on the phone when I open Chrome".</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Asked where the news comes from, she says, "I don't know anything about that."</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A report from Ofcom found that "when people consume news in this way, their engagement is typically fleeting."</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Moreover, "they are also less likely to be aware of the source of news content.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Some younger people we spoke to didn't have a close association with the BBC, regarding it as just 'one of many' online news providers."</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">*checks notes·

BUENOS AIRES
Covid-19 and debt restructuring will make or break the presidency of Alberto Fernández
Until recently advisers to Argentina's president, Alberto Fernández, quoted the old saw that crisis brings opportunity.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Inaugurated in December, he is dealing with two calamities that no one can blame him for: a deep recession inherited from his predecessor, Mauricio Macri, and the covid-19 pandemic.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Argentines give Mr Fernández high marks for his response.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">On becoming president he raised taxes and froze pensions and salaries to stabilise public finances.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">He acted early to slow the spread of covid-19, shutting borders, business and most transport by decree on March 12th.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">People who break the rules face fines and prison sentences.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The lockdown is having an effect.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">On April 23rd Argentina had 3,288 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 159 deaths from it.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">That is far fewer than in Spain, which has roughly the same number of people (though it may be an underestimate).</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Mr Fernández's approval rating has soared.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A recent poll by Poliarquía puts it at 81%.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">"I didn't think of him as a leader," says Gabriel Más, a farm worker.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"I do now."</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">But both Mr Fernández and the country he leads are entering a dangerous phase.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Pressure to ease the lockdown is building before the pandemic has peaked.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">And the government has begun a gambit to support the economy that may end up weakening it further.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Success would be the making of his presidency and brighten the future of his Peronist political movement.</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">Failure could be disastrous for both.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">"Will he be the creator of a new political hegemony, or author of social chaos if he generates economic havoc?"</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">asked Jorge Fontevecchia, a media mogul, in a newspaper column.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">On April 16th the economy minister, Martín Guzmán, demanded that creditors accept new securities to replace $65bnworth of bonds, almost 40% of foreigncurrency debt.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">This does not come out of the blue.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Mr Macri had sought to stretch out debt payments.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">In appointing Mr Guzmán, a specialist in debt negotiation, Mr Fernández made it clear that he would give greater priority to restoring growth than to paying creditors.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">The pandemic greatly increases the urgency.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">With revenue crushed by recession, the government is on track to run a primary deficit, ie, before interest payments, of at least 4% of gdp this year.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The Central Bank is printing money to keep the government going, which risks driving up inflation, already at 50%.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Over the next two years Argentina's scheduled payments of foreigncurrency debt are nearly as large as its foreign-exchange reserves of less than $44bn.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">"Argentina can't pay [creditors] anything right now," says Mr Guzmán.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">So far, though, bondholders are unsympathetic.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Argentina's demand "does not represent the product of good-faith negotiations", complained one group that holds about 16% of the debt.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The mood in the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace, is grim.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Argentina may be headed for its ninth default.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">"Between pandemic and debt, now maybe default, it looks like double jeopardy," says a presidential adviser.</span>
  <span class="neg5" style="background-color: #a50026;color: white">The consequences of default would be grisly.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Output, squeezed by the lockdown, would shrink by far more than the 5.7% forecast by the imf for this year.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">The peso would plunge, pushing inflation even higher.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Unemployment and poverty would soar.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Despite a history of default, "even we may not recognise what's coming: economic meltdown and social unrest, alongside a pandemic," warns Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The government wants to wring the maximum relief it can from bondholders without triggering that disaster.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Mr Guzmán is seeking a modest "haircut" of 5.4% on the principal (which would save the government $3.6bn) and a dramatic 62% cut in interest payments.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">These payments would start low, at just 0.5%, and late, beginning in 2023, when an election is due.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">They would peak in 2029 at less than 5%.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Under this plan, the government would save $37.9bn on its interest bill.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">The absence of even a token payment until May 2023 will stiffen creditors' resistance.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">With no prospect of money coming in, they could spend the next three years lobbying and litigating for a better deal.</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">They complain that the government has been slow to disclose its strategy for servicing the debt that would remain.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The plans it has released so far do not take into account the effects of covid-19.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">"If you're a creditor, told to wait three years, you need to hear the plan," says a source close to both investors and the government.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">There is little time to resolve the tussle.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The Fernández team put a 20-day limit on negotiations.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">But the real deadline is May 22nd, the end of the 30-day grace period for a missed $500m payment.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">"There is recognition that default is much more likely than not," says the presidential adviser.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Veterans of past renegotiations hold out hope of an agreement.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Argentina's offer preserves much of the face value of the debt.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">There may be wriggle-room in the schedule for repayment.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The price of Argentina's existing bonds rose after it made its proposal, a sign that the offer is more appealing than investors were expecting.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Government negotiators are "pushing it to the cliff-edge, as they must, to remind all that default is a disaster for all", says a former finance minister.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Mr Fernández is using brinkmanship, too, in his battle with the pandemic.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">"Quarantine, social distancing, will extend beyond April," said Pedro Cahn, a government epidemiologist.</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Even then, "we have to expect many more cases and many more deaths."</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Workers in private hospitals say that the government's low numbers for covid-19 cases and fatalities reflect a lack of testing.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">They fear "dramatic loss of life" when the virus peaks, probably in early June, in poor neighbourhoods that ring Buenos Aires and in other cities.</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Mr Fernández is trying to shield poor Argentines from the consequences of the lockdown, in part by taxing richer ones.</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">The government has given bonus payments to welfare recipients, informal workers and people who work in health care, policing and supermarkets.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">It has imposed new freezes on prices of food and medical supplies.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Congress may reconvene to levy a tax on Argentines' worldwide assets.</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The "patriotic" tax will "kill the chicken that lays the eggs for future recovery", warns Aldo Abram, an economist.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The pre-existing recession makes the trade-off between public health and economic growth even more painful than it is for most countries.</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Under pressure from trade unions and business, Mr Fernández has allowed organisations in 11 sectors, including export industries and refuges for victims of domestic violence, to reopen.</span>
  <span class="pos3" style="background-color: #66bd63;">But he is likely to rule out a quick return to normality like that advocated by Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, who makes light of covid-19.</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">Mr Fernández knows that the pandemic is more merciless than Argentina's creditors.</span>

 Covid-19 is forcing the world to confront a new form of collective trauma 
 The nightmare began in earnest for residents of Parque das Tribos when their cacique , or local chief , died of covid-19 .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Messias Kokama had battled politicians , developers and drug gangs to transform a dusty informal settlement on the outskirts of Manaus , a city of 2 m people deep in the Brazilian Amazon , into a haven for some 600 indigenous families from 35 ethnic groups .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">He was 53 and said he was n't afraid of the virus .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">His death on May 13th shook the community .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">By then , hospitals in Manaus were turning people away and cemeteries were digging mass graves .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Ambulances would n't come to Parque das Tribos ( " Tribes Park ) because the city and the federal indigenous agency each claimed that indigenous city - dwellers fell to the other institution .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Such neglect exacerbated their grief .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Every few days another elder would start gasping for air .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Those who made it back from hospital told horror stories of frigid wards packed with dying patients and doctors who did n't speak their language .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">One resident fled the icu .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">" He said he would rather die in a hammock than surrounded by tubes , said his daughter - in - law , Cláudia Baré .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Five weeks later , he did .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">The pandemic has now subsided in Parque das Tribos .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Burials in Manaus have fallen from more than 150 per day to the prepandemic norm of around 35 .</span>

  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">It scarcely seems imaginable that just two months ago , boats were arriving at the port with covid-19 patients who had died on the journey .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Yet the chaos of the past few months is giving way to a second crisis .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Lingering trauma and continued hardship will take much longer to overcome .</span>

  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In many countries it has dropped dramatically .</span>

  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">It becomes harder to bring people back together and easier to open new wounds .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">If nothing is done , this can permanently damage a society - and even destroy it .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">In Buffalo Creek untreated grief and neglect en masse led to the demise of several towns .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Though the term may have been new , the experience of collective trauma was not .</span>
  <span class="neg5" style="background-color: #a50026;color: white">Mass trauma has now been identified in the context of wars , natural disasters and terrorist attacks .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Research shows that people and communities are typically very resilient .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Yet exposure to death puts them at greater risk of lasting affliction .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Violence and disasters owing to negligence - such as the Buffalo Creek flood or the explosion on August 4th at a warehouse in Beirut that killed some 150 people - are more likely to lead to trauma than " acts of God " such as hurricanes or earthquakes .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Pandemics do not fall neatly into either category .</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( sars ) outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 , nearly 40 % of the population experienced increased stress , 16 % showed signs of trauma and only 25 % believed they were very likely to survive if they contracted the disease even though the death rate was around 10 % of people infected .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">A review of studies involving patients treated for sars found that a third went on to develop symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , a condition that can result in vivid flashbacks and difficulty sleeping .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">But past epidemics are imperfect proxies for covid-19 .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Its unprecedented reach across the globe and into nearly every aspect of life makes it more like a world war .</span>
  <span class="neg5" style="background-color: #a50026;color: white">There were no large - scale psychological studies during the first or the second world wars , though the Holocaust would become the event most deeply associated with mass death and grief .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Researchers in the early 2000s found roughly half of Holocaust survivors were still suffering from ptsd .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Many had other disorders such as schizophrenia .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Even among non - Jewish Europeans who were children during the war , 10 - 40 % still had ptsd symptoms .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In communities of survivors , research has shown that " inherited trauma " can be passed to subsequent generations , by growing up flooded with their parents ' memories , and possibly , through genes .</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">The suffering caused by covid-19 falls far short of the horrors of the Holocaust .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Still , Krzysztof Kaniasty , a psychologist and disaster expert , points out that the pandemic presents nearly all the risk factors for ptsd .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">It has caused sudden death , life - changing events , large - scale social ruptures and chronic stressors like uncertainty and the added hassles of daily life .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">The luckiest will suffer mildly from one or two of these effects .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Yet more than at any other point in recent history , millions of people have been slammed by all of them .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">In the first large - scale survey of a developed country struck by covid-19 , published in July by Psychiatry Research , 29 % of 15,530 Britons surveyed met the criteria for a general psychiatric disorder .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">In Spain , where a shortage of protective kit has meant nearly a sixth of all covid-19 infections are of health workers , more than half are showing signs of ptsd .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Another study found 86 % of Bangladeshis are dealing with covid - related stress , resulting in insomnia , irritability and family problems .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">There are signs of hope .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">In the long run people fare better when they perceive strong social support in the aftermath of a catastrophe and worse when they feel neglected or excluded .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">" Strong communities buffer against adverse traumatic effects , " says Joshua Morganstein of the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda , Maryland .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">His studies of health workers in Florida after hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 found lower rates of ptsd and depression among those who reported living in places with tight - knit social circles , which are better able to organise in times of crisis .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Adverse learning conditions 
 On February 21st the first case of covid-19 in Italy was diagnosed at a small hospital in Codogno , a serene town with cobbled streets not far from the river Po .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Its inhabitants were soon experiencing drama of a sort they had seen only in films .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Roadblocks were thrown up around the newly declared " red zone " and residents besieged pharmacies for personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , which quickly ran out .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">" It was like being in a war with an invisible enemy , " says Rosa Cavalli , whose family owns one of the pharmacies .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">But within days , 100 people were working as volunteers at an operation centre run by Italy 's disaster - response service .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The struggling community radio station , which was renamed " Red Zone Radio " , began putting out twice - daily bulletins to counter fake news and conspiracy theories .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">" There was an initial moment of disorientation , " says Nicoletta Porcu , a psychologist who formed part of a crisis group with colleagues .</span>
  <span class="pos5" style="background-color: #006837;color: white">But the outpouring of support helped the town emerge strengthened from the trauma .</span>
  <span class="pos4" style="background-color: #1a9850;">Mr Kaniasty , the professor , has found that " received support " that might come in the form of a donation is less important for psychological outcomes than " perceived support " , the feeling that people can rely on their neighbours .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">As Codogno came out of lockdown in June , the degree of compliance with distancing rules - necessary for recovery - was astonishingly universal .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">The parish priest , Monsignor Iginio Passerini , was taken aback during confession to hear a young boy list among his sins that of having lowered his face mask outdoors .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Mass tragedies can teach groups of people how to avoid or mitigate them in future .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Such " adversarial growth " helps explain why commuters in Hong Kong wore masks before any covid-19 cases had been reported .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Most credit the territory 's scarring experience with sars , which included tragic mistakes .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">But it also raised the profile of doctors .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">A record number of students applied to study medicine .</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">The government added isolation wards in hospitals , trained infection specialists and stockpiled ppe .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Such investments paid off this year .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Not a single covid-19 death was reported among Hong Kong 's hospital workers .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">The response earned the unpopular government a ratings boost , but a controversial security law has undermined public trust and may compromise its mass - testing strategy .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Covid-19 is easier to deal with than some traumas .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">It moves more slowly and is more dispersed than a natural disaster , buying governments time .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Unlike a war or a terrorist attack , there is no direct human enemy to blame .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Some find comfort in the fact that the whole world is going through hardship at once .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">When Wayne Bai , a worker at a telecoms company in Wuhan , made a business trip the day after the city 's lockdown lifted , he was denied a room at seven hotels .</span>
  <span class="neg4" style="background-color: #d73027;">But his annoyance faded as the virus spread across the globe .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">This universality has drawbacks , of course .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">One is that poor countries can not turn as readily to rich ones for money or supplies .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Aid workers who usually arrive after disasters would have been welcome in Guayaquil , Ecuador , where funeral services collapsed in late March , leading to a pile - up of bodies in homes .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Zaida Rovira of the public ombudsman 's office recalls trying to console a 70 - year - old who had spent four days with his brother 's body in the room they shared .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">At the Guasmo hospital , relatives had to enter refrigerated containers to look through hundreds of unlabelled corpses .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">More than 70 remain unidentified .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Only recently did staff start collecting 
 dna samples after admitting sending photos of the bodies to relatives on WhatsApp may have led to misidentification .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Guayaquil , a tropical business hub of 2.7 m people , is still counting the dead .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">They may top 10,000 , which would give it one of the highest death rates of any big city .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Yet it disappeared from headlines in April and has had to deal with its trauma alone .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Most family members have received no psychological support .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">This points to yet another important characteristic of covid-19 - its mental - health burden falls unequally in different parts of the world .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">This exacerbates suffering in areas that failed to implement lessons from prior traumas .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Parts of New Orleans where black people died of covid-19 at rates two to three times higher than white people were the same areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Then , racist housing policies had herded minorities into low - lying areas .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">Now , a higher share of minorities work in front - line jobs cleaning hospitals or stocking shelves .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">They also have more underlying health problems like diabetes , often caused by poor access to primary care .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The remains of the pain 
 Good leadership can bring people together in a crisis .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Polarising leadership has the opposite effect .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">In Brazil Jair Bolsonaro has echoed Jair Bolsonaro's American counterpart 's claim that the economic fallout of covid-19 is a greater trauma than the death toll .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In both countries social distancing is a political statement .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Even when hospitals were full in Manaus , less than half of people stayed at home .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">The local governor tried to cast himself as responsible , but people stopped trusting him after his health secretary was arrested on charges of embezzlement tied to a fake respirator company , which she denies .</span>
  <span class="neg5" style="background-color: #a50026;color: white">Corruption was more blatant in Guayaquil .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">The ombudsman 's office is investigating reports that morgue staffers demanded $ 700 from relatives to return bodies , though most family members are too traumatised to sue .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Chaos at the top makes it harder to grapple with a harsh reality .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Some stop believing altogether .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Psychologists who set up a hotline in Manaus were surprised to discover that even callers who had lost relatives downplayed the virus 's role , claiming other ailments ultimately killed them .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">Many believe online conspiracy theories , such as one claiming the state had exaggerated the death toll to receive more federal money and another alleging that the coffins buried in mass graves were filled with rocks .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Sônia Lemos , who ran the hotline , said locals were going through collective denial .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">" It 's a defence mechanism that saves people from feeling responsible .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">" 
 There is a danger that political divisions , social distancing and economic woes will over time lead to a loss of togetherness in the same way that displacement after the Buffalo Creek flood gave " a degree of permanence to what might otherwise have been a transitional state of shock " , in the words of Mr Erikson .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Communities can not grieve together because the disaster is ongoing and the threat has yet to disappear , says Judith Lewis Herman , a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">She describes three stages of healing : re - establishing safety , remembrance and mourning , and reconnecting with others .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Social distancing complicates all of them .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">And so like the pandemic itself , the psychological fallout will require assessment and adaptation .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Many doctors are still focused on saving lives , but governments and mental - health professionals should start thinking about " psycho - social " interventions .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">In France " medical and psychological emergency units " offer one model .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">They were launched to respond to mentalhealth concerns after a terrorist attack in 1995 .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">People are offered psychological support immediately , near the scene , just as they would be offered paramedical services .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Four years after 86 people were killed in Nice in a terrorist attack , the city has broadly returned to normal , says Frédéric Jover , the psychiatrist then running the unit .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">But empty streets this spring brought back ghastly memories .</span>
  <span class="neg3" style="background-color: #f46d43;">Nice reactivated its unit to help people struggling with bereavement , anxiety and isolation .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">The fact that covid-19 is slower than a bomb or a flood gives governments and ngos an opportunity to identify and deal with mental - health issues before it is too late .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Fuelled by national protests against racism and police violence , advocacy groups in Louisiana are proposing policies for a " racially and economically equitable " covid-19 recovery .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">New York City 's health department is hosting virtual town - hall meetings for African - Americans , including webinars about bereavement .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">But it will not be easy to sustain the recent surge in community organising and mutual - aid networks ( such as WhatsApp groups to bring groceries to old people ) that have sprung up across the country .</span>
  <span class="neg1" style="background-color: #fee08b;">Fatigue and forgetting can lead social networks to deteriorate , says Sarah Lowe of the Yale School of Public Health .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">" Often people are still recovering when resources are cut off .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">" One of her studies found that a year after Hurricane Sandy , which hit New York City in 2012 , mental - health outcomes were similar across demographic groups .</span>
  <span class="neg2" style="background-color: #fdae61;">But two years on , the poor were faring worse .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Poor countries spend much less on mental - health services and their citizens have fewer resources to get help .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">So healing will have to come from the ground up .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">This will require the creation of spaces - physical or virtual - for people to come together .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">In Parque das Tribos Ms Baré organised a WhatsApp group to distribute food baskets .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">A local nurse used her free time to go door - to - door checking on covid-19 cases and eventually persuaded the city to send a mobile - health station .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">Mr Kokama 's family petitioned the courts for permission to bring his body back for a 30 - minute , closed - coffin ceremony .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">His friends and neighbours gathered on a recent Sunday , the first time since the funeral , settling into lawn chairs to watch local dance groups perform to raise money on Facebook Live .</span>
  <span class="neut" style="background-color: #ffffbf;">" This is still a cry for help , " said Luciana Vasconcelos as she painted her friend 's face red and black .</span>
  <span class="pos1" style="background-color: #d9ef8b;">She added that Parque das Tribos owes its existence to a kind of collective trauma : indigenous people leaving the forest for the city in search of a better life .</span>
  <span class="pos2" style="background-color: #a6d96a;">A speaker boomed out traditional lyrics with modern beats , and a mobile phone on a tripod filmed the dancers , some in т - shirts , others in beads , all beaming with a stubborn sort of hope .</span>

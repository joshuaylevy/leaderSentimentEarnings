WITH his sights on the G20 leaders' summit in Russia early next month, Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, faced a conflict. Mr Rudd takes credit for boosting Australia's role in the G20, and is happy on the world stage. So after he toppled Julia Gillard as Labor Party leader and prime minister in June, Mr Rudd had hoped to put back Australia's expected date for a general election in order to glad-hand world leaders first. Yet party barons warned him not to try his luck. Famous for once ignoring advice, this time Mr Rudd listened. Dropping his travel plans, he has called an election for September 7th, the day after the summit ends. 
Mr Rudd casts himself as underdog in a five-week campaign he says will be ""pretty rough"". When they reinstalled Mr Rudd as leader, Labor power-brokers aimed to escape the electoral drubbing that opinion polls showed the government faced when Ms Gillard was prime minister. Mr Rudd led Labor to power in 2007, ending 11 years of conservative government, only to be unseated as leader by Ms Gillard three years later. He took his revenge on June 26th to make a comeback as prime minister. In spite of Labor's turmoils, Mr Rudd's return has changed the party's game. 
It has turned the election into a competitive race against the conservative Liberal-National coalition and Tony Abbott, its leader. An opinion poll on August 5th, the day after Mr Rudd announced the election, showed Labor trailing the opposition by just four points, once second-preference votes were counted; the last poll under Ms Gillard had Labor 14 points behind. Other polls since Mr Rudd's return suggests that the parties are neck-and-neck. 
Yet turning improvements in the polls into electoral victory will be hard. In the 150-seat House of Representatives, where government is decided, Labor holds 71 seats to 72 for the opposition parties. Two independents in New South Wales who supported Ms Gillard's minority government have stepped down, and the opposition seems likely to win both seats. Mr Rudd's salvation might lie in Mr Rudd's home state of Queensland. Voters there turned against Ms Gillard for her knifing of Mr Rudd. Peter Beattie, a former Queensland Labor state premier, reckons they will reward their favourite son's return with enough seats to offset losses elsewhere, delivering victory to Mr Rudd. Mr Beattie himself is coming out of retirement to contest an opposition-held seat. The political terrain is altered by the rise of small parties, such as the WikiLeaks Party, aiming to rob both Labor and the coalition of control of the Senate, the upper house. WikiLeaks's seven candidates include Julian Assange, standing for the Senate from the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he is holed up fighting extradition to Sweden. 
Labor's campaign also faces an enemy in the two-thirds of Australia's big-city newspapers that are controlled by News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's empire. Mr Murdoch made his stand plain in Sydney's Daily Telegraph, his most influential tabloid. Its first edition of the campaign covered the front page with the prime minister's picture and a call to readers to ""Kick This Mob Out"". Some say this fits Mr Murdoch's pattern of backing the candidate he thinks will win (the Telegraph supported Mr Rudd before his victory in 2007). The prime minister himself says the mogul's strategy is commercial. He told journalists in Brisbane that Mr Murdoch wanted ""his mate, Mr Abbott, in"" because a high-speed broadband network the government is building around Australia could ""challenge"" Foxtel, a cable-television company that News Corporation half-owns with Telstra, a telecoms giant. 
But if Mr Rudd has clawed back voters' support, it is partly by racing Mr Abbott to the bottom on issues that resonate in the tabloids' heartlands, notably getting tough with asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat. Mr Rudd's plan to resettle them in Papua New Guinea, Australia's nearest northern neighbour, seems to have gone down well in Sydney's sprawling, multi-ethnic western suburbs, where Labor faces losses. Nationally, voters like Mr Rudd more than Mr Abbott: an early campaign poll gave him a 14-point lead as preferred prime minister. 
The leaders are likely to slug out most of the campaign over which of them can do a better job on the economy. On August 2nd the Treasury revised its outlook for growth in 2013-14 to 2.5%, slightly lower than its forecast three months ago. It projected a A$33 billion ($29 billion) drop in forecast tax revenues over the next four years, partly because of falling commodity prices and a slowdown in China, Australia's biggest trading partner. That leaves little room for big spending promises. The election could boil down to a contest between ""trust"", as Mr Rudd puts it, or ""who is more fair dinkum"", in Mr Abbott's spin.",A0,Negative,2,,,,3,3,2,3,3,3.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

Mr Rudd's salvation might lie in Mr Rudd's home state of Queensland. Voters there turned against Ms Gillard for her knifing of Mr Rudd. Peter Beattie, a former Queensland Labor state premier, reckons they will reward their favourite son's return with enough seats to offset losses elsewhere, delivering victory to Mr Rudd. Mr Beattie himself is coming out of retirement to contest an opposition-held seat. The political terrain is altered by the rise of small parties, such as the WikiLeaks Party, aiming to rob both Labor and the coalition of control of the Senate, the upper house.

IT HAS long been an article of faith among Canadians--just as it once was among Britons--that their commitment to an easygoing multicultural society protects them from home-grown Islamist terrorism. That belief was shattered this month when police charged 12 men and five youths with planning a wave of attacks, ranging from blowing up the Toronto Stock Exchange to storming the national public broadcaster and the Parliament buildings in Ottawa--and beheading the prime minister. 
All of the suspects involved were Canadian Muslims from the Toronto area, most of them of South Asian origin and two from Somalia. That prompted comparisons with the made-in-Britain London bombings of last July. This time, at least, the plot was foiled. An anti-terrorist squad from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested 15 of the 17 on June 2nd. In a police sting operation, the suspects were held as they took delivery of three tonnes of ammonium-nitrate fertiliser which, the authorities say, they planned to use for bomb-making. The other two were already in jail, accused of smuggling weapons from the United States. Several of those arrested were worshippers at a shopfront mosque in Mississauga, a middle-class suburb of Toronto. The imam was the suspected ringleader. 
Even undetonated, the bombs sent shock waves not only across Canada but also across its southern border. They have prompted questions about immigration policy and the official approach of fostering diversity rather than integration. They are also likely to sharpen debate about the deployment of Canadian troops in Afghanistan, whose removal, it seems, would have been one of the main demands of the accused. In the United States, some pundits were quick to seize on the arrests as proof that Canada was a safe haven for terrorists and as justification for tighter border security.
The arrests were not a complete surprise. The previous week, Jack Hooper, a senior officer of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, told a parliamentary committee that up to 60 groups and about 350 individuals were under surveillance because of suspected terrorist leanings. ""All of the circumstances that led to the London transit bombings, for example, are now resident in Canada,"" Mr Hooper said. Although Canada had not suffered a significant act of terrorism since the bombing in 1985 of an Air India flight from Montreal, which killed 329 people, he said that there was no room for complacency. 
Stephen Harper, the prime minister, has shown no inclination to make political use of the incident, which may dampen its impact. He joked about the threatened beheading, saying he could live with such threats ""as long as they don't come from my own caucus."" Peter Donolo, a political analyst, points out that if Mr Harper's Conservative Party is to turn its current minority status into a majority at the next election, it needs to win seats in cities that are home to large numbers of immigrants. Playing the race card, something Mr Harper might have been inclined to do in opposition, is not the way to do that. 
Mr Harper also knows that Canadians strongly support immigration, even though the proportion of foreign-born residents is among the highest in the world. A survey last month by Ipsos, a polling company, found that 75% of respondents believed immigrants had a good influence on their country, compared with only 54% in Australia, 52% in the United States and 43% in Britain. While suspicion of Muslim immigrants will now doubtless rise, it may not do so by much. ""Canadians are cautious and careful about pointing fingers. It is our nature,"" says John Wright of Ipsos. 
The attack is unlikely to cause Mr Harper to change policy towards Afghanistan, where Canada has some 2,300 troops, mostly engaged in security duties in the violent southern province of Kandahar. They were sent by the previous Liberal government, but Mr Harper recently sought and won a vote in Parliament to keep them there until 2009. 
The United States raised its state of alert on the Canadian border. But Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, hailed the arrests as ""a great success"" for Canada's counter-terrorism efforts. Co-ordination on counter-terrorism between the two countries is ""excellent"", she said. Christian Leuprecht, a security analyst at Canada's Royal Military College, suspects that American officials were tipped off in advance, giving them time to prepare their response. He says that, far from straining cross-border relations, the arrests will tend to persuade many in Washington, DC, that Canada is taking terrorism seriously. 
That may not stop some American politicians from making the most of a supposed threat from flabby, liberal Canada. In 1999, an Algerian-Canadian was held when he crossed the border in a car containing explosives and timing devices; he was jailed for planning to detonate a suitcase bomb at Los Angeles International Airport. After the terrorist attacks of September 11th, American officials temporarily imposed strict checks on vehicles crossing the border. The latest incident has probably put paid to already slender Canadian hopes of exemption from a law due to take effect in 2008 that will require Americans to hold a passport, rather than just a driving licence, to cross land borders. 
Canada remains one of the world's most tolerant countries. Yet it would be nave to imagine that nothing will change. Parliament is reviewing its own security precautions. For now, however unjustly, a cloud of suspicion hangs over the country's 750,000 Muslims (2% of the total population). A mosque was vandalised after the arrests, and more such incidents may follow. ""This is supposed to be a free and democratic society. You are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty,"" complained the father of one of the accused. But Canada was also supposed to be a country where the prime minister ran no risk of losing his head.",A1,Negative,2,,,,2,4,3,4,4,3.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

How to protect Brazil's democracy from a president with authoritarian instincts
Brazilians face an awful choice. One candidate in the presidential run-off on October 28th is Jair Bolsonaro, a seventerm congressman who venerates dictators and guns, goads police to kill suspected criminals, threatens to banish opponents and belittles women, blacks and gays. His rival is Fernando Haddad, the nominee of the leftist Workers' Party (pt). Its 13 years in power, from 2003 to 2016, ended in a self-inflicted economic depression and revelations that the party encouraged bribery on an unprecedented scale, in part to prolong its hold on power.
Dilma Rousseff, a pt president, was impeached in 2016 for hiding the true size of the budget deficit. Crime continued to rise after she left office. Nearly 64,000 people were murdered in Brazil last year, a record number. Understandably, Brazilians are enraged. They now look poised to elect Mr Bolsonaro, a populist with authoritarian instincts, as their president.
That such a man will probably lead Latin America's largest country is a tragedy. If it happens, it will be because Brazil's political class has failed the country's people. Some of the corruption was orchestrated by the pt, but almost all parties took part in it. Today's crime and economic stagnation are a consequence of a dangerously indebted state that is at once too big and too feeble to provide adequate policing, education and other public ser- vices. Nearly all politicians share the blame for that.
Mr Bolsonaro's probable election will pose a new challenge: ensuring that a president with autocratic impulses does not subvert Brazil's democracy. It is critical that politicians of all ideologies rise to the occasion. But they cannot forget about the old problems. If Mr Bolsonaro puts forward good ideas for fixing the economy and controlling corruption, he should get help.
Brazil is a relatively young democracy; dictatorial rule ended in 1985. But it is not a weak one. Although Brazilians view congress as a corruption-ridden collection of rent-a-parties, it is not a rubber stamp. It has impeached two presidents in the democratic era and can provide a vital check on Mr Bolsonaro. The judiciary has shown its independence over the past four years through the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigations. These have implicated scores of politicians and led to the jailing of the pt's leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president. The press is already challenging Mr Bolsonaro, which is why, like Donald Trump, he accuses it of spreading fake news.
Such institutions can thwart some of Mr Bolsonaro's worst plans. He wants the police to have ""carte blanche"" to kill. But the main police forces are under the authority of the 27 states. Their governors must reject his trigger-happy philosophy. Congress can stop him from carrying out his threat to stuff the supreme court with pliant judges. Mr Bolsonaro's proposal to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and his eagerness to promote development in the Amazon, where rates of deforestation appear to be rising, should alarm the world. Congress and activist groups can stand in his way.
Not all Mr Bolsonaro's ideas are bad. He has shown more interest than the pt in solving Brazil's main economic problems (see Americas section). If he is serious about reforming the costly pension system, which threatens Brazil's financial stability, and eliminating useless rules, congress should co-operate. (Though that is a big ""if"".)
The worst effects of a Bolsonaro presidency may be hardest to contain. Already he has damaged Brazil's democratic culture by praising the former dictatorship, choosing as his runningmate a retired general who has justified military coups under some circumstances, and insinuating that political opponents are enemies of the state. He probably does not intend to be a dictator. But his corrosive rhetoric may make Brazilians more receptive to autocracy in the future. To confront that, Brazil needs an opposition that defends democratic norms and an army determined to remain scrupulously apolitical.
In their despair, Brazilians are about to reject a discredited party in favour of a political adventurer with repellent ideas. That is unlikely to turn out well.

WHO leads Europe? At the start of this year, the answer was obvious. Angela Merkel was trundling unstoppably towards a fourth election win, while Britain was out, Italy down and stagnating France gripped by the fear that Marine Le Pen might become the Gallic Donald Trump. 
This week, it all looks very different. Mrs Merkel won her election on September 24th, but with such a reduced tally of votes and seats that she is a diminished figure (see ""Germany's election: Merkeldammerung""). Germany faces months of tricky three-way coalition talks. Some 6m voters backed a xenophobic right-wing party, many of them in protest at Mrs Merkel's refugee policies. Having had no seats, Alternative for Germany, a disruptive and polarising force, is now the Bundestag's third largest party. 
Yet west of the Rhine, with a parliament dominated by his own new-minted and devoted party, France's President Emmanuel Macron is bursting with ambition (see ""Regeneration: France's new beginning""). This week he used a speech about the European Union to stake his claim to the limelight. Whether Mr Macron can restore France to centre-stage in the EU after a decade in the chorus depends not just on his plans for Europe, but also on his success at home, reforming a country long seen as unreformable. 
Angela's leading man 
Start with Europe. This week's speech was brimming over with ideas, including a shared military budget and an agency for ""radical innovation"", as well as the desire to strengthen the euro zone. At one level, Mr Macron's bid for the role of intellectual innovator in Europe fits a long French tradition. Moreover, elements of his speech--a new carbon-tax on the EU's frontiers, a proposal to tax foreign tech firms where they make money rather than where they are registered, a crusade against ""social dumping"" with harmonised corporate tax rates--were in keeping with long-standing French attempts to stop member states competing ""disloyally"" against each other. 
Yet Mr Macron has a more subtle and radical goal than old-style dirigisme; as if to prove it, he agreed this week that Alstom, which makes high-speed trains, could drift from state influence by merging with its private-sector German rival. His aim is to see off populism by striking a balance between providing job security for citizens, on the one hand, and encouraging them to embrace innovation, which many fear will cost them their jobs, on the other (see ""Charlemagne: The Emmangela show""). In his speech Mr Macron also made the case for digital disruption and the completion of the digital single market. Euro-zone reform would make Europe less vulnerable to the next financial crisis. 
The merit of these ideas depends on whether they lead to a more enterprising, open and confident Europe or to a protectionist fortress. But they may not be tried out at all unless Mr Macron can make a success of his policies at home. For, if France remains a threat to the EU's economic stability rather than a source of its strength, its president can never be more than a bit player next to Germany's chancellor. 
Mr Macron's domestic policy might seem to have made a poor start. He has grabbed headlines thanks to the size of his make-up bill, the collapse of his popularity and the whiff of arrogance about his ""Jupiterian"" approach to power. Predictably, the grouchy French are already contesting the legitimacy of the plans they elected Mr Macron to carry out. Reform in France, it seems, follows a pattern. The street objects; the government backs down; immobilisme sets in. 
Yet take a closer look, and Mr Macron may be about to break the pattern. Something extraordinary, if little-noticed, took place this summer. While most of the French were on the beach, Mr Macron negotiated and agreed with unions a far-reaching, liberalising labour reform which he signed into law on September 22nd--all with minimal fuss. Neither France's militant unions, nor its fiery far left, have so far drawn the mass support they had hoped for onto the streets. Fully 59% of the French say that they back labour reform. More protests will follow. Harder battles, over pensions, taxation, public spending and education, lie ahead. Mr Macron needs to keep his nerve, but, astonishingly, he has already passed his first big test. 
In many ways, the 39-year-old Mr Macron is not yet well understood. Behind the haughty exterior, a leader is emerging who seems to be at once brave, disciplined and thoughtful. Brave, because labour reforms, as Germany and Spain know, take time to translate into job creation, and usually hand political rewards to the successors of those who do the thankless work of getting them through. Disciplined, because he laid out clearly before his election what he planned to do, and has stuck to his word. The unions were fully consulted, and two of the three biggest accepted the reform. Compare that with his predecessor, Francois Hollande, who tried reform by stealth and encountered only accusations of bad faith. Last, thoughtful: Mr Macron does not approach policy as an a la carte menu. He has grasped how digital technology is dislocating the world of work. His governing philosophy is to adapt France's outdated system of rules and protections accordingly.

Over the past few years, an enfeebled France has been a chronically weak partner for Germany, pushing Mrs Merkel into a solo role that she neither sought nor relished. If he is to change that dynamic, Mr Macron needs to move swiftly to match his labour law with an overhaul of France's inefficient training budget, increase the number of apprenticeships and renovate the state's sleepy employment services. He also needs to explain with a less contemptuous tone why his plans for tax cuts, including to France's wealth tax and corporate tax, are not designed simply to benefit business and the better-off. In Europe he needs to reassure the northern, more open economies that he is not trying to put up walls. 
Of course, Mr Macron's first steps in the spotlight may falter. The odds on any leader reforming France are never high. He will struggle to convince Germany to embrace his vision of euro-zone reform. But, if this year has shown anything, it is that it is a mistake to bet against the formidable Mr Macron.",A3,Positive,4,,,,5,4,4,4,4,4.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

ON THE day Japan experienced the world's worst nuclear accident since the Chemobyl disaster in Ukraine, the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, was engaged in planning a cabinet shuffle. He was busy constantly on the telephone discussing his new team with party heavyweights and having last-minute negotiations with his coalition partners over the legislative programme for the coming parliamentary session. 
It was not until mid-afternoon on September 3oth, some five hours after the explosion in Tokaimura, known as japan's atom city, that the head of the country's Nuclear Safety Commission, Kaoru Mamiya, told the chief cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, that he suspected that the radiation leak posed a health hazard to residents in the area. At six that evening an ""anti-disaster headquarters and liaison office"" was set up in the prime minister's official residence. But the anti-disaster team, chaired by Mr Obuchi, did not hold its first meeting until nine o'clock, more than ten hours after the Tokaimura plant had gone critical. 
The experts briefing the prime minister's team infuriated everyone by merely insisting that the accident should never have happened. The rules in force at the plant made criticality impossible, they insisted. But the plant continued to disobey the rules. The chain reaction, instead of dying down, got a second wind. Mr Obuchi feared he would be tom to pieces by the opposition as well as the press if he tried to manage such a crisis with a government in transition, and put off his cabinet shuffle. 
But what of his government's sluggish response to the disaster? Mr Obuchi seems to have had some luck, a virtue much coveted by all prime ministers. The fall-out could have been much worse had it not poured with rain in Tokaimura, a town of 33,ooo people. The rain diluted the contamination and prevented it from drifting as a cloud across the surrounding countryside. 
As it was, the radiation level outside the uraniumprocessing plant soared 4,ooo-fold. About 80 local residents fled their homes and a further 310,ooo in neighbouring communities were told to remain indoors until the allclear was given the following morning. Some 49 people were confirmed as having been exposed to the radiation that spewed out of the unshielded plant after three workers had accidentally tipped more than six times the required amount of uranium oxide into a processing tank-triggering a nuclear chain reaction that the plant's owners swore could never happen (see page 101). 
Mr Obuchi had some more luck with the eventual response of Japan's vast nuclear industry. Once it became clear that Tokaimura was in deep trouble, the electrical utilities rushed supplies of borate compounds from their nuclear power stations to Tokaimura to mop up the neutrons being emitted by the uranium oxide that had gone critical. Around six in the morning of October ist, the radioactivity surrounding the site began to drop, indicating that the chain reaction had at last been arrested. 
Nevertheless, the Japanese people are far from reassured that the nuclear industry, which provides about a third of their power, is in safe hands. They believe that, despite its passion for rules and regulations, Japanese officialdom is woefully inadequate at providing emergency measures and acting expeditiously when things go seriously awry. There have been several accidents at nuclear plants in the past few years (see map) none of them as serious as that at Tokaimura, but worrying just the same. Now it is claimed that the company which ran the stricken plant, JCO, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining, one of the country's oldest companies, has broken the laws on nuclear safety for a decade to save money. 
Public pressure will doubtless mount for measures to rein in the country's nuclear industry. Mr Obuchi understands this. To save Japan's nuclear industry from the kind of dismemberment that happened in America after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, he has decided to throw the book at JCO. A noisy show trial of the one company actually caught breaking the law may divert criticism from the suspect practices of others in the industry, and at the same time encourage them to mend their ways. On cue, JCO had its nuclear licence revoked on October 6th and police raided its offices, looking for evidence that it had behaved illegally. 
Meanwhile, the prime minister has ordered safety checks to be undertaken at all plants in Japan that handle nuclear fuel. After finding time to shuffle his cabinet on October 5th, the prime minister promptly instructed the relevant ministers to draft fresh legislation to cover nuclear disasters and to strengthen existing laws on safety standards for nuclear reactors and related plants. His main purpose is to give the central government the authority to issue evacuation orders and take prompt action when a nuclear emergency occurs, instead of having to sit around while an inadequately prepared prefectural governor's office fumbles, as apparently happened in Tokaimura. 
Parliament reopens in early November. Given the large majority the new coalition has in both houses, the necessary legislation could be passed by the end of the year.

EVER since the euro crisis erupted in late 2009 Greece has been at or near its heart. It was the first country to receive a bail-out, in May 2010. It was the subject of repeated debate over a possible departure from the single currency (the so-called Grexit) in 2011 and again in 2012. It is the only country in the euro zone whose official debt has been restructured. On December 29th the Greek parliament failed to elect a president, forcing an early snap election to be called for January 25th. The euro crisis is entering a new, highly dangerous phase, and once again Greece finds itself at the centre. 
Investors promptly swooned, with the Athens stockmarket falling by almost 5% in a single day, bank shares down by even more and Greek ten-year bond yields rising to a new 2014 high of 9.5% (over seven points above those for Italy). The reason for this collective outbreak of nerves is that the polls point to an election win for Syriza, a far-left populist party led by Alexis Tsipras. Although Mr Tsipras says he wants to keep Greece in the euro, he also wants to dump most of the conditions attached to its bail-outs: he would end austerity, reverse cuts in the minimum wage and in public spending, scrap asset sales and seek to repudiate much of the country's debt. Such a programme seems, to put it mildly, to sit uncomfortably with Greece's continuing membership of the single currency. 
The early election is likely therefore to create a political crisis in Greece. What happens beyond that is less clear. Investors seem to be betting that the people of Italy, Spain and France will peek at the chaos in Athens, shudder--and stick to the austerity that Germany's Angela Merkel has prescribed for them. But that seems too sanguine to this newspaper. It is hard to believe that a Greek crisis will not unleash fresh ructions elsewhere in the euro zone--not least because some of Mrs Merkel's medicine is patently doing more harm than good. 
The Greek kalends 
Begin with Greece. For 14 months Syriza has been ahead of the ruling New Democracy party of the outgoing prime minister, Antonis Samaras, in the polls. Although the economy is now growing again, Greek voters remain understandably enraged that GDP should have shrunk by almost 20% since 2010 and that unemployment is still as high as 26%. As it happens, Syriza's poll lead has narrowed in recent weeks, but even if it does not win an outright parliamentary majority, it is likely to be by some margin the biggest party, so Mr Tsipras can expect to lead any coalition government that is formed after the election (see page 21). And this time round Mrs Merkel will struggle to repeat the 2012 trick of asking Greeks to vote again in the hope that they might produce a more sensible government. 
In its policies Syriza represents, at best, uncertainty and contradiction and at worst reckless populism. On the one hand Mr Tsipras has recanted from his one-time hostility to Greece's euro membership and toned down his more extravagant promises. Yet, on the other, he still thinks he can tear up the conditions imposed by Greece's creditors in exchange for two successive bail-outs. His reasoning is partly that the economy is at last recovering and Greece is now running a primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments); and partly that the rest of the euro zone will simply give in as they have before. On both counts he is being reckless. 
In theory a growing economy and a primary surplus may help a country repudiate its debts because it is no longer dependent on capital inflows. But the Greek economy still has far to go to restore its lost competitiveness, and Mr Tsipras's programme would undo most of the gains of recent years. The notion that EU leaders are so rattled by fears of Grexit that they would pay any price to avoid it was more valid in 2011 and 2012 than it is now. The anti-contagion defences that the euro zone has since built make Grexit easier to contemplate for northern Europeans. Much has been done to improve the euro's architecture, with a new bail-out fund, the European Central Bank's role as lender of last resort and a partial banking union. Moreover, most of the bailed-out and peripheral countries are at last growing again, and unemployment is starting to fall. 
Europe's Lehman moment? 
The result is a game of chicken that neither Greece nor Europe can afford. Even if the Grexit is safer, it is still perilous and unpredictable. There was a worrying echo this week of the Lehman crisis of September 2008. Then the widespread assumption was that the global financial system was robust enough to cope with the failure of a single investment bank. Now investors are putting their trust in the resilience of unemployment-plagued countries like France, whose president has record levels of unpopularity, and Italy, whose economy has shrunk in constant prices in the first 14 years of this century (even Greece's GDP is higher now than it was in 1999). 
That stagnation points to the deeper reason for caution. The continuing dismal economic performance of the euro zone now poses a big political risk to the single currency. In the short run, so long as creditor countries (and that means principally Germany) insist only on budgetary rectitude and reject all proposals for further monetary and fiscal stimulus, that performance seems unlikely to improve. Worse, inflation is now so dangerously low that the euro zone threatens to tip into years of deflation and stagnation worryingly reminiscent of Japan in the 1990s. The continent's leaders have largely failed to push through the structural reforms that could make their economies more competitive. When voters see no hope, they are likely to vote for populists--and not just in Greece. 
As 2015 approached, most of Europe's leaders assumed that the worst of the euro crisis was behind them. The early Greek election shows that hope was premature. Populist parties of left and right that are against the euro, explicitly or not, continue to gain ground in many countries--the leader of Podemos, Spain's highest-polling party, welcomed Mr Tsipras's success in forcing an election this week (see page 22). Ironically, when a country starts to recover is also when popular discontent often boils over. That message needs to be heeded this week in Berlin as much as in Athens.",A5,Negative,1,,,,2,,2,3,1,2.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

 IT LOST, but, even in losing, Fidesz, the conservative party of Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, proved that in Central Europe too nationalist populism pays.
 Before the first round of the elections, on April 7th, the then opposition Socialists said polls were understating their support. Albeit narrowly, a surprise success proved them right: they got more votes than Fidesz, and won more of those seats decided in that round. Before the second one, on April 21st, Fidesz in turn insisted it could bring out enough extra voters to turn the overall result around. Since turnout in the first round had been a record 71%, and details of the figures looked unfavourable, that sounded even more unlikely. Yet turnout on the 21st was 73.5%, and Fidesz managed to end with 189 seats, only five short of a majority in the 386-seat parliament.
 How was it done? In the first round, the voters seemed to have rejected extremism. The Socialists, despite their unpleasant Communist heritage, are now quite like modern European social democrats. Fidesz is to the right of most centre-right parties. And the radical nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party did not reach the 5% needed to get any seats at all. So did Fidesz, between the rounds, aim for the centre?
 No, it became more populist and nationalistic. It held big, flag- waving rallies--one attracted several hundred thousand people--and told them that the free-market-minded Socialists would hand Hungary over to big business and (this for the farmers) let foreigners buy their land.
 The result revealed a divided country. The well-off west--well- off, ironically, thanks to foreign investment--favoured Fidesz. The poorer and less populous east mainly voted Socialist. Budapest, home to a fifth of the population, gave Fidesz only four of the city's 32 individual constituencies, and those by narrow margins.
 Peter Medgyessy, the Socialists' prime-ministerial candidate, a former finance minister with experience as an economist and banker, will depend on the support of the liberal Free Democrats, the only other party to have passed the 5% threshold. The two parties co- operated between the first round and the second, to maximise their seats, and on April 22nd began talks on a coalition, as in 1994-98.
 Even before the second round, the two parties were talking about healing the nation's divisions. They may manage a bit of that in parliament. Fidesz's electoral list included a second party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum. This latter, more like a typical Christian Democrat party, had shared in power, but in opposition its now 24 members may break away and be readier to ease the new government's path.
 Even so, Hungary looks set for four years of a government with a majority of only eight. And Fidesz will harry Mr Medgyessy-- especially if, as some Socialists have promised, the new government investigates corruption under the old one.

SUCCESSES in soccer and politics do not always go together. Even as euphoric Spaniards revel in their team's Euro 2008 win on June 29th, they know that the real party, celebrating a decade of fizzy growth, is over. The Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, would prefer them to focus on sport, not the economy. But even though he was elected to a second term in March, his popularity is now tumbling, in line with the economy.
The litany of bad news has become interminable. Growth is slowing sharply and unemployment is rising. The housing bubble has burst and residential construction has seized up. Prices of petrol, electricity, food and a host of other things Spaniards buy have all gone up sharply, as (on July 3rd) did euro-area interest rates.
It is no surprise that half of all Spaniards now consider their personal financial position to be worse than in March. This may not be all Mr Zapatero's fault, but he is the man they are blaming. Striking truck-drivers caused chaos on the roads and left supermarket shelves empty for a week in June. The four-point lead that the Socialists had over the People's Party (PP) opposition in March has now evaporated.
It does not help that the government keeps denying that it faces a crisis. The finance minister, Pedro Solbes, refuses to utter the word ""crisis"" at all. Mr Zapatero told the daily El Pais that its use was ""a matter of opinion"". They are supported by Banco Santander's president, Emilio Botin, who compares the fraught state of the economy with a child's fever: dramatic, but short-lived. Yet crisis may be too bland a word: many economists think ""recession"" will soon be more appropriate. Mr Solbes admits that second-quarter growth will be below the first quarter's paltry 0.3%. His prediction of 2008 growth is now somewhere ""below"" 2%. On July 2nd a defiant Mr Zapatero told parliament he did not believe recession was coming.
In his first term, a smiling Mr Zapatero rode the crest of the economic wave, with a feel-good image of optimism and positive thinking. From regional devolution to gay marriage, he spread a message of goodwill to all. The economy was given little attention as it turned in growth rates well above 3% every year. Cures for every social or political ill seemed possible, as there was plenty of money around.
Things started to go wrong when Spain's frothy construction industry began to deflate last year. A healthy budget surplus, a promise that the grey but trusted Mr Solbes would run the economy and a pledge to return EUR 400 ($630) to every taxpayer helped the Socialists to win the election. In effect, Mr Zapatero got back before voters realised how bad things were. His EUR 400 rebates will pump some EUR 6 billion into consumers' pockets. Yet much of it has already been swallowed up in higher mortgage payments and soaring petrol and food prices. The budget surplus has gone. This year Mr Solbes promises only ""almost balanced"" accounts.
What else can Mr Zapatero do? He has no control over interest rates, international finance or commodity prices. More infrastructure spending is touted as one answer, but with the Socialists pledging not to cut social spending, it will mean either more borrowing or finding offsetting spending cuts. More privatisation may help, as will a cut in the numbers of bureaucrats and a freeze on senior civil-service pay--but the amounts are not huge.
What the economy really needs, says the Bank of Spain, is to rein in wage growth and make the labour market more flexible. Mr Zapatero has called on unions and employers to start talking. But Mr Solbes has said that making it cheaper to fire workers is not a priority. Cuts in corporate-tax rates have also been ruled out. Other supply-side reforms, for instance to education, will have little immediate impact.
On the political side, too, Mr Zapatero is set for a bumpy second term. The PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, has at last shifted his party towards the centre after a long ideological battle. His reward, according to one poll, was to become more popular than Mr Zapatero for the first time. Mr Zapatero heads a minority government that is seven seats short of an absolute parliamentary majority. The small nationalist parties from Catalonia, the Basque country and elsewhere hold the balance of power. They are already playing tough over supporting next year's budget.
If the economy offers him no respite, where can Mr Zapatero turn to boost his flagging image? Step forward the Basque regional premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, who has called a double referendum on talks with the armed separatists, ETA, and on a vague Basque ""right to decide"". Mr Ibarretxe, a nationalist, is pushing the limits of devolution and seeking votes in the regional election due this autumn. But he may also have handed a gift to Mr Zapatero. The referendum gives him a chance to be hard on ETA and devolution--both areas where voters thought he was too soft in his first term. Mr Zapatero has said he will get the referendum banned by the constitutional court before it can take place.
This is not the only example of Mr Zapatero's deciding that being tough can pay. Spain's immigrants, most of whom arrived in the past seven years, have accounted for a big chunk of the economy's growth. Now they are starting to lose their jobs. Immigrants make up 11% of the workforce, but half of those who are newly unemployed. The government is offering to pay them a lump-sum unemployment benefit if they go home. A plan to stop them bringing over parents or adult children may discourage new immigrants. Both measures appeal to voters who fret that immigration has been too rapid. 
Mr Zapatero has spotted a problem that many Spaniards now confront for the first time, as they compete with immigrants for scarce jobs. In his second term, Spain's so far relaxed race relations may be tested. Fixing the economy would be the best answer. But getting tough on immigrants may prove an easier way to stay popular than promoting unloved economic reforms.",A7,Positive,4,,,,2,,2,2,2,2.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

Now the future of MMP itself is in doubt. 
Its critics have argued that, by producing no clear winner, the system is bound to lead to unstable government. The prime minister, Jenny Shipley, who intends to battle on with a minority government, is no fan. For a while, at least, Mrs Shipley can probably avoid an early election. Eight of New Zealand First's 16 Mrs have left their party to sit as independents and say they will give their support to Mrs Shipley's National Party in votes of confidence. That means that Mrs Shipley should be able to count on 62 votes in the country's 120-member parliament. Events came to a head in cabinet on August 12th. Mr Peters and four colleagues walked out in protest at plans to sell the government's stake in Wellington airport. Mrs Shipley then sacked Mr Peters as deputy prime minister and treasurer, claiming he continually challenged her integrity. 
Mrs Shipley is living up to her reputation as a tough fighter. She became New Zealand's first female prime minister after ousting Jim Bolger as leader of the National Party last year while he was travelling abroad. Mr Peters, who formed his own party after being sacked from National's parliamentary group in 1992, has said he firmly believes in MMP and that people voted for it in a 1993 referendum ""knowing full well that the outcome was liable to produce coalition government to ensure moderating influences in New Zealand politics"". Until then, two parties, National and Labour, had had a strangle hold on politics in New Zealand in a firstpast-the-post system. 
At a recent National Party conference, Mrs Shipley said she favoured changing the present system. A discussion paper proposed that a referendum should be held ""to put the fate of the electoral system back in the hands of the people"". The National Party has been thinking of holding it at the same time as the next general election, which is due in 1999. 
The idea has been gaining ground. A recent opinion poll found support for mmp had dropped from 42% at the time of the October 1996 election to just 29% now. Over half the people polled favoured a first-past-the-post system. A study published in July by the University of Waikato found that only 15% of people thought coalition politics was working. But even if the voting system is changed, it is unlikely to affect the next election. That means Mrs Shipley has not only to cling to office but also to fight another campaign based on MMP before she can be sure of her grip on power.

Sweden and Denmark, as well as being in the eu club, are toying with the prospect of joining the euro too. Are Norway and its 4.5m people starting to feel the Arctic chill of isolation, with only Iceland's defiantly independent 280,ooo islanders giving them a splash of solitary Nordic comfort? 
fens Stoltenberg, Norway's left-of-centre prime minister since March, has long been keen for his country to join Europe's most popular club. ""Europe's future is Norway's future,"" he says eagerly. But ask whether he will now set about coaxing Norwegians towards their Euro-destiny and he becomes embarrassingly lame. He will merely ""discuss changing the party programme to give the possibility of raising a platform to consider possible membership after 2001 [ie, after the next general election]."" Not exactly the most stirring of pledges. Plainly, it will be hard to convince foreigners that he is a ""good European"" if he remains loth to urge his own people to ` join Europe"". 
On the face of things, as Mr Stoltenberg knows, Norway has little reason to change its ways. It is one of the richest countries (number three, in terms of income per person) in the world, and one of the most contented. It is the world's second-biggest exporter of oil. It has vast reserves of off shore gas and thoroughly efficient fish farms. Its unemployment rate, at 3%, is the lowest (bar Luxembourg's) in Europe. Its economy, with a slight blip last year when the oil price went down, is growing nicely at over 396 for the year. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway enjoys all the free-trade perks of the EU. 
Still, if Mr Stoltenberg were to dare to try pulling his country Eu-wards, he would start off with some advantages. The country's youngest-ever leader at 41, he is bright, handsome, cosmopolitan: a gust of fresh air after his lacklustre predecessor as Labour's leader, Thorbjorn Jagland. He has deep roots in his party, not least because his father, Thorvald Stoltenberg, was a long-serving Labour foreign minister (and later the UN's high commissioner for refugees). Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's longest-serving prime minister since the war, was an attentive mentor. 
But Mr Stoltenberg knows that Norway is too divided, politically, to risk rushing into a controversial and bruising battle to shift its place in Europe or in the rest of the world. Though his Labour (ie, social democratic) government looks a shade more secure than its predecessor, an oddly shaped centre-right coalition led by Kjell Magne Bondevik, a clergyman inclined to bouts of gloom, it has only 65 seats out of 165 in Norway's parliament. Soon after he got the top job, Mr Stoltenberg was shaken by a series of strikes for higher wages which led to an expensive revision of the budget. Despite a spurt of goodwill after the new man's advent to power, the Labour Party, which has run Norway almost without interruption since the second world war, is far less popular than it was. A recent opinion poll gave Labour 28% against ao% for the right-wing populists of the Progress Party and 19% for the mainstream Conservatives: not the sort of figures to spur a new leader to start selling a policy that would buffet his own party as well as the country at large. In 1972 and again in 1994, Labour governments were rebuffed in referendums on joining the Eu (or its predecessor). Even now, the wounds have barely healed. 
So Mr Stoltenberg has to make do with trying to boost Norway's role in the world-outside the Eu. ""We want to take more global responsibility,"" he enthuses hopefully, while adding, somewhat forlornly, ""and in Europe we want as close a relationship as possible."" To give Norway its lonely due, it does strikingly well at holding its head up abroad. Its main boast, well-founded, is that it contributes more than its fair share towards NATO, the world's greatest military alliance. It has been keen to bolster the post-Soviet Baits. It has sent plenty of men, including muchneeded police, to Kosovo, and was quick to promise to put 3,500 Norwegians into a planned Eu-controlled rapid-reaction force. Norway, says Mr Stoltenberg, provides more uN peacekeepers, in proportion to its population, than any other country. 
It has also played a lively part in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which the Russians have tried to boost as the continent's main conflict-settling forum; last year, Norway's foreign minister was its chairman. And Norway has played a notable part in seeking peace in such places as Israel (remember the Oslo accords of 1993), Myanmar and, more recently, Sri Lanka. 
It has also been outstandingly generous in handing out a bigger share of its wealth, 0.996 of GDP, to the world's poor than any other country; the prime minister says he wants that figure to rise to 1%. Some of Norway's social democrats fancy that, while eschewing the dirty business of big-power politics, they have made their country a ""humanitarian great power"". Noting that the uN's ""human development index"", which purports to measure people's overall well-being, ranks Norway second only to Canada, Mr Stoltenberg earnestly suggests that ""we can serve as a model to other countries. We are rich but our wealth is equally shared."" 
So why bother to reach out, in due course, to the Eu? For one thing, many Norwegians fret that, though within its free-trade zone, they have no influence on the club's rules, let alone the veto power that its smaller countries so treasure. And even that cherished place at NATO'S high table may look less safe if the EU's foreign and security policy gains substance: already, both bodies are scratching their heads over what to do about countries such as Norway and Turkey which are in one club but not the other. 
Suppose that Mr Stoltenberg stays on as prime minister after next year's general election. Norwegians may still feel happy to stand apart. But the sense of isolation may sharpen. And Mr Stoltenberg and his party may, once again, have to climb off the fence.

THE Germans invented the word Zeitgeist, but anyone hoping that their latest election would confirm a new ""spirit of the age"" in Europe will have been disappointed. In the past year or so, a clear trend seemed visible. Left-wing governments were ousted by the right in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal and Norway. Germany looked like the next and biggest domino to fall. But though Gerhard Schroder's ""red-Green"" coalition wobbled, it refused to topple. Just the week before Mr Schroder's victory, Sweden's Social Democrats also bucked the trend, easily winning another stint in office. Now Austria's Social Democrats have a chance of regaining power later this year. So much for Europe's inexorable move to the right.
The broader truth, however, is that on the big economic and social issues facing Europe the differences between centre-right and centre-left--between Christian democracy and social democracy--are pretty paltry. Certainly the right is still closer to business, the left to the trade unions. But the resulting differences in policy have more to do with nuance than deep philosophy. In Germany, for example, Edmund Stoiber on the right proposed a top rate of income tax of 40%, while Mr Schroder wants to bring it down to 42%. Mr Stoiber said the state should consume no more than 40% of GDP, Mr Schroder stuck to his own favourite number, 42%. Economists and businessmen may clamour for a drastic revamp of Germany's generous welfare state and for decisive moves to tackle public pensions, but neither candidate was prepared to risk suggesting anything daring. As Mr Stoiber drily remarked, he had not noticed anyone demonstrating for a radical overhaul of social security.
What is true of Germany is true of the rest of Europe. Italy's Silvio Berlusconi admires Margaret Thatcher but has done nothing to tackle Italy's pensions problem and little to free up the labour market. France's new centre-right government has moved cautiously to mitigate the worst effects of its Socialist predecessor's introduction of a 35-hour week but is committed to an extensive welfare state and shows no desire to take on the unions.
Faced with such tiny differences between left and right on the big issues of social and economic management, voters tend to plump for the most appealing personalities. One big reason why Mr Schroder and Sweden's Goran Persson won while Lionel Jospin, a French socialist, lost is that the winning pair are highly effective politicians while Mr Jospin came across as dull and stiff. Tony Blair's mastery of British politics relies at least as much on his personality--and his Schroder-like sense of what people want to hear--as on any particular policies. 
It was Mr Blair who made the last real attempt to define a new pan-European (and indeed transatlantic) political Zeitgeist. When the centre-left held sway on both sides of the ocean, he earnestly pushed forward his big idea--""the third way"". Mr Schroder tried briefly to echo him with cosy talk of a ""new middle"". But the whole Blairite philosophy was too vague to catch on and much of the European left disliked what little it understood of it, assuming it was code for a kind of soft-edged Thatcherism. Mr Blair has now almost given up talking about the third way. In a recent interview in Prospect, a British magazine, he was reduced to claiming that ""in parts of Latin America [the third way] is seen as a ground-breaking moment."" (They speak of little else in the queues outside Argentina's banks.) 
But while a welfarist consensus may still hold sway across the European Union, consensus politics are fraying around the edges in other ways. The most striking recent trend has been the rise of populist parties openly hostile to immigration. When Austria's People's Party became the first such party to join a governing coalition, there was outrage across the EU. But the rise of politicians making similar appeals elsewhere in other EU countries has muted the outcry. The Pim Fortuyn list in the Netherlands and Umberto Bossi's Northern League in Italy have both joined governing coalitions after campaigns that highlighted the supposedly bad effects of immigration. The new centre-right Danish government relies on the votes of an anti-immigration party. As Bertel Haarder, Denmark's immigration minister, points out, there may be a connection between addiction to welfarism and hostility to immigrants. Partly because of high minimum wages and welfare benefits, there are very few jobs for unskilled immigrants: around 60% of them in Denmark have no job. So they are easily stigmatised as free-loading parasites.
Mainstream politicians have reacted in different ways to the rise of anti-immigration parties. In France the National Front's Jean-Marie Le Pen won close to 20% of the votes in the presidential election but remains firmly beyond the pale. The new French government has nonetheless begun to toughen both rhetoric and actions against illegal immigrants. All across the EU, asylum-seekers are getting a frostier welcome.
Vox populi, a pox on civility?
The rise of anti-immigration populists has demonstrated the political potential of voicing sentiments often heard in the street but rarely in parliamentary chambers. Mr Schroder's campaign was a variation on this theme. Struggling in the polls, he decided to express the anti-Americanism that is a strong current of public opinion in Germany and the rest of the EU. Warning against ""adventures"" in Iraq and carping at the American economic model was just a mild version of commonplace feelings. Mr Schroder's supporters took the hint--and helped him cling on to power. However, as with the immigration debate elsewhere in Europe, once a political taboo is broken it is hard to control the consequences. German relations with America have nose-dived. And new and queasy-making sentiments are popping out of the closet at home, such as the ill-fated comparison between George Bush and Hitler allegedly made by Mr Schroder's justice minister. Sometimes taboos are there for a reason.",A10,Negative,2,,,,2,,3,3,3,3.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

Last year Pratap Bhanu Mehta, the most Olympian of India's public intellectuals, infuriated many of his compatriots. Instead of lauding the audacity of a government that had just imposed direct rule on Jammu and Kashmir, India's most troubled state and its sole Muslim-majority one, Mr Mehta issued a warning. We should not cheer the ""Indianisation"" of Kashmir, he said, but rather fear a creeping ""Kashmirisation"" of India. The focus should not be on what Narendra Modi, the prime minister, wanted Indians to see: an assertion of national (read Hindu majoritarian) will and an end to decades of flaccid ambiguity over the territory, which is claimed by Pakistan. Rather, argued Mr Mehta, it should be on what was meant to remain unseen in Kashmir: the failure of the world's biggest democracy to respect its most basic constitutional responsibility, to seek the consent of the governed.
In his first term, before his thumping re-election last year, Mr Modi often reflected such dualities. He could speak of unity while practising the politics of division, or talk of freeing markets while entrenching the power of the state, or publicly champion the little man while privately pandering to mighty plutocrats. Now well into his second term, the prime minister seems not only to have kept his Janus face, but to have sprouted the extra arms of a Hindu deity.
In a few short weeks his government has pushed through an impressive stack of laws. Tackling issues that have for decades been cobwebbed by political point-scoring, it has among other things taken bold steps to free farming from state control, untangle stifling labour rules, revise public education and reform the bureaucracy. The new regulations on labour, for instance, collapse 44 laws into four simplified national codes.
The moves are understandably controversial. They take a sledgehammer to chunks of the patriarchal socialist state, erected in the early decades of India's independence, that had escaped earlier bouts of liberalisation. Mr Modi's numerous and noisy acolytes are proclaiming a great moment of transition. Even critics of his government concede that, whether or not the specific laws are well-considered, Mr Modi has at least shaken trees that needed shaking and at last shown the mettle to do what he had promised, but failed to deliver, in his first term.
Yet all this welcome vigour in the foreground cannot completely disguise what happens in the background. Just as with one arm Mr Modi unshackles India's economy, with another he is quashing hardwon freedoms. His government used not only its bigger numbers, but petty rules, a highly dubious voice-vote and an opposition walk-out to ram more than two dozen laws through parliament in a single week.
Away from parliament, too, the Modi government's disdain for due process grows ever more striking. To a degree unprecedented even in India's murky politics, it has turned ostensibly impartial agencies of the state, such as the police, into blunt instruments of executive power. And in their zeal to promote a glowing narrative, the prime minister's supporters go to bizarre lengths to mute or discredit contrary views. This is not just a matter of critics facing bogus lawsuits or tax demands. During one recent media frenzy, an army of sycophantic television anchors and online trolls screamed murder after a Bollywood actor's tragic suicide, just to besmirch a political party that opposes Mr Modi's.
Behind all the noise, what such antics reveal is an increasingly pronounced aspect of the Modi era that residents of Kashmir, in particular, are all too familiar with: hypocrisy. Consider foreign funding. Citing national security and the need for accountability, the Modi government has selectively throttled donations to groups it does not like. Over six years some 15,000 ngos have been forced to shut, the latest being the Indian office of Amnesty International, a humanrights defender. Yet with another hand, Mr Modi pulls a veil over political funding, as well as over the personal ""emergency"" fund for the prime minister that was set up during the pandemic.
Whatever he is doing with all his other hands, Mr Modi is always sure to keep one free for waving at crowds. In ""liberated"" Kashmir last year, cameras caught him on a ship on Lake Dal, standing erect like an admiral of the fleet. More recently he was pictured at the opening of a road tunnel high in the Himalayas, standing aboard a jeep, again waving. But a closer view of both scenes revealed something else. There were no crowds, only security men.",A11,Negative,2,,,,1,,2,1,2,2.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

TO UNDERSTAND Austria, visit the Karl-Marx-Hof. This vast municipal housing complex in Vienna is still riddled with bullet holes--not from fighting between Russians and Germans in 1945, but from a little-known civil war in 1934, when Austrian leftists and conservatives took up arms against each other. After the second world war, the country adopted a political system designed to prevent this from ever happening again: the Social Democrats (SPO) and the Christian Democrats (OVP) would rule together and divvy up public offices under a system known as Proporz. 
For 43 of the past 72 years the two parties have run Austria jointly, in grand coalitions. Their networks politicise everything from school boards and business groups to social clubs and unions. The result is a uniquely corporatist country. 
Today, however, that system is breaking up. Other parties--first the far-right FPO, then the Greens, then the liberal NEOS--have challenged the old duopoly. Both the SPO and the OVP have lost members. Economic stress adds to the pressure. A decade ago Austrian unemployment was a little over half that of Germany; now it is 50% higher. On May 10th Reinhold Mitterlehner, the OVP vice-chancellor, resigned and brought down the dysfunctional SPO-led grand coalition. Elections will take place on October 15th. ""What is happening in this country?"" marvelled Profil, a news magazine: ""Austria is unrecognisable, and redefining itself breathtakingly fast."" 
At the heart of the drama is Sebastian Kurz, Austria's 30-year-old foreign minister, its most popular politician and the OVP's new candidate for chancellor. In one sense, he is a product of the old-fashioned associational system, having soared through his party's ranks as head of its youth organisation. He turned the youth wing from a stagnant backwater into a dynamic network of local groups, putting on parties, pub nights, bike rides and various other opportunities for teenagers and 20-somethings to get it on with one another. In 2013 his youthful, liberal base, centred on Vienna, propelled him to the post of foreign minister. He then won over the party's right-wingers by taking a tough stance on immigration. 
Yet Mr Kurz is also determined to break Austria's old political architecture. He accepted his party's crown only after its bosses had agreed to several demands. These include the freedom to transform the OVP into a list of candidates, pick names for that list, bypass its powerful state bosses and formal interest groups (known as Bunde) and set its policies. Having soared in the polls (see chart), he is now trying to persuade prominent figures in NEOS, the Greens and civil society to join his list. Though his manifesto is a closely-guarded secret, insiders hint at liberalisations of Austria's schools, labour market and transfer payments. ""Taking money in taxes and paying it straight back in subsidies is wrong,"" Mr Kurz argues. 
Christian Kern, the SPO leader and current chancellor, is more defensive of the old model: ""It made Austria strong"", he says. He suggests that Mr Kurz is more image than substance, and doubts whether he can escape the old OVP structures. But like his rival, Mr Kern is a businesslike type who reckons Austria's paternalist model is dying. ""In the past it ran from cradle to grave: you would spend your free time in the Alpine club, at work you would be a member of an SPO or OVP trade union, from the nurseries to the emergency services everything was parcelled up. These connections have dissolved dramatically."" Mr Kern's response is what he calls Plan A, a package of liberalising economic reforms and infrastructure investments. 
Will Mr Kern or Mr Kurz succeed in remaking the system? Critics accuse the former of being a game-player whose grand plans amount to little. And they accuse the latter of merely rebranding the OVP. (Important tests include whether he omits unimpressive OVP placeholders from his list, whether he can persuade his party to support gay marriage and whether he can stand up to the teachers' Bund in support of education reform.) Of the two, Mr Kurz is the most ambitious. 
But the real barrier will probably be that of coalition formation. Messrs Kurz and Stern may agree, largely, on what is wrong with Austria, but after ten years of grand coalition their parties hate each other. Both would like to form a government with NEOS and the Greens, but the numbers look unpromising. That leaves the FPO, with which both the OVP and SPO govern at state level and with which both are willing to form a federal government in October, well aware of the diplomatic opprobrium this would attract. 
Both of Austria's prospective leaders accept that the country's political system is breaking up. The problem is that, unless polls shift, whoever wins will probably be saddled with a government too weak to allow a thorough programme of reforms. Austrian society is evolving. But whether its politics can keep up is uncertain.

IN CITY after city, India is booming. Visit Delhi or Mumbai or Hyderabad, and they are full of shining new office towers and American-educated MBAs. The suburb of Palm Meadows (pictured) outside Bangalore, the home of high-tech and outsourcing, looks like the richer blocks of Los Angeles. The stockmarket has risen by more than 20% this year (see chart 1 on next page), though it slipped back a bit this month. In the second quarter, India's GDP grew by 8.1% compared with the same period last year. After annual growth of around 7% in 2003 and 2004 (see chart 2), the country is on course, many economists think, to repeat the trick this year and next.
India's IT companies are world-beaters. Firms such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, which owe their success to large, co-operative software-development projects for companies in America, are now beginning to compete directly with the big IT multinationals for large consultancy contracts. Out of this IT infrastructure has grown a huge business in ""outsourcing"" almost any business process that can be performed remotely, from answering a call in a help centre to interpreting an X-ray. The largest outsourcing firm relaunched itself in September as Genpact, partially disguising its origins as the Indian back-office of General Electric, and expects to exceed $1 billion in annual sales by 2008.
These service businesses have thrived because they have capitalised on India's strengths--computer skills, fluency in English--and are not hostage to its weaknesses. Yet those weaknesses are all too obvious, and are the reason why India on many counts still lags behind its neighbour-rival, China. India has lousy infrastructure, bumbling and burdensome regulation and restrictive labour laws. And economic reform now appears to have stalled in political recriminations. 
Last year's election gave no party a clear majority. A delicate arrangement allowed Manmohan Singh, of the left-of-centre Congress party, to take office as prime minister, while a committee was set up to negotiate policy between Congress and its coalition partners (together called the United Progressive Alliance or UPA) on the one side, and the Left Front of Communists and other left-wing parties on the other. The committee, however, has not managed to meet since June, though on October 26th there were rumours that it was about to. Meanwhile, the Communists--without whom the coalition has no majority in Parliament--are getting truculent. They staged a four-month boycott of the co-ordination committee to press their policies and then, in concert with the trade unions, called a one-day general strike on September 29th. It was ignored in many places, but the banks, along with the Communist stronghold of Kolkata (Calcutta), were paralysed. 
When Mr Singh was finance minister, in the 1990s, it was he who pushed through the measures that kick-started reform in India. Without the support of the Left Front, however, he can do nothing more. His most significant legislative achievement to date has been a law that guarantees 100 days' employment to every household in India's 200 poorest districts. Though the Left Front loves it, many economists reckon that much of the money--as much as 1% of GDP, by some estimates--will be wasted or stolen.
The list of what Mr Singh has been prevented from doing is much longer. Completely ruled out has been any progress on liberalising India's notoriously rigid labour laws. The key battleground is a rule preventing any company with more than 100 employees from making redundancies without obtaining approval from local labour boards. According to the Left Front, this protects workers from unscrupulous employers. In fact, it makes employers wary of taking on new staff, opening new factories or, in the case of smaller companies, growing beyond the threshold of 100. It protects unionised labour, in short, at the expense of those not in work. 
The Left Front, which draws most of its support from organised labour, does not greatly care. Its eyes are on state elections due next year in West Bengal (whose capital is Kolkata) and Kerala, the two biggest states where the Communists are strong. Those who are losing out from unreformed labour laws are hundreds of millions of people now marginally employed in the countryside. These people need jobs in manufacturing if India is to improve its record on poverty, as well as growth. Jobs could be found in the labour-hungry textile industry, especially now that, with the ending of the developed world's protectionist Multi-Fibre Arrangement, India's textile exports are booming. As it is, a jobless boom is going on in manufacturing, which is growing at 7% annually, but without increasing employment. 
Touches of xenophobia
India's antiquated laws are not only preventing it from exploiting the textile boom as successfully as China (whose textile businesses are so successful that they provoke retaliation). They are also pushing it far behind China in terms of foreign direct investment. FDI has been the most important driver of China's growth, not just because of the money involved (more than $60 billion last year) but also because of the technology, expertise, marketing relationships and much else that this money represents. India's showing has been far less impressive: about an eleventh of China's haul last year (see chart 3). 
One chief reason for the discrepancy is that India imposes caps on FDI in a host of economically important, or politically sensitive, sectors: insurance, aviation, coal-mining, media and much else. Chief among these is retailing. Though franchise operations are allowed, foreign direct ownership is banned, which explains why even Delhi's smartest shopping areas are scruffy and chaotic places with limited stock. 
Mr Singh's government would like to raise the caps, and had some success at first. It proposed in February, for example, that the cap for telecoms investment should be lifted from 49% to 74%, and this has just, at last, been approved. But the Left Front is violently opposed to any tinkering with the rules for FDI in retailing. Its leaders appear to accept that the advent of, say, Wal-Mart would generate many jobs, since much of what the company sold would be domestically produced (Wal-Mart spends $15 billion a year in China). But they worry that millions of small retailers would be put out of work. For those who want to move out of farm work, a small shop is often their first choice. 
Mr Singh remains optimistic, but on slender grounds. With the Left Front so adamant, nothing is likely to happen. And the same is true of privatisation, or its younger sibling, disinvestment, the selling of minority stakes in state-controlled companies. From the very start of its tenure, the government was forced by the Left Front to agree not to privatise nine so-called ""crown jewels"", or leading state-owned companies. But the Left has taken advantage of its position to go beyond what was originally agreed. When, in June, the government announced plans to sell a 10% stake in Bharat Heavy Electricals, an engineering firm, the Left Front vigorously objected. Although the sale does not require legislation, and so could be enacted by the minority government, the government shows no stomach for doing so. 
Another disappointment--though the word is perhaps inappropriate, since no one ever expected a Congress government to have the necessary courage--is the failure even to attempt to do anything about the mountain of subsidies that distort the Indian economy. Often badly targeted, benefiting middle-class people more than the poorest, they consume a shocking 14-15% of GDP.
Worst of all, Indian politics may actually be retreating to its bureaucratic past. Take oil pricing, a complex statist rigmarole that had been moving from the hands of government to those of a regulator. Under Mr Singh, price decisions are again being taken by the government. 
The prime minister's instincts are sometimes depressingly bureaucratic. Faced with obvious and longstanding problems, he commissions a study on them. The latest strategy document appeared in September from a specially convened National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council. It listed the most pernicious difficulties for manufacturers: power shortages, taxes and the ""inspector raj"". No one was surprised by these, or felt much hope they would be fixed. 
Removing the brake
It may seem odd, if reform is so important, that the economy is doing so well without it. There are a number of reasons. The biggest is that the Indian economy is so strong, structurally and cyclically, that it can ride out a period of wobbly policy. India's young population gives it a fast-growing workforce and a declining proportion of dependants. Over the next few decades, that will be good for savings and investment. Industry, meanwhile, has recovered from a splurge of over-investment in the mid-1990s. It has improved efficiency and is now both reaping the benefits and investing again in new capacity.
The government started to get out of business's way in the 1980s and, especially, after a balance-of-payments crisis in 1991. At that point Mr Singh, as finance minister, was given the freedom to bring in reforms by an unexpectedly brave prime minister, Narasimha Rao. Since then, government has been unable to put an absolute crimp on growth. Many important reforms--especially trade liberalisation, but also the dismantling of the ""licence raj"" of bureaucratic obstacles to enterprise--are well in train and not in reverse.
Almost every budget since 1991, including this year's, has cut import tariffs and freed more industries from ""reservation"" for small firms, a big hindrance to competitiveness in businesses that might benefit from economies of scale. This year, moreover, saw the introduction of one long-planned reform, a standardised value-added tax imposed at state level. Typically, politics meant that not all states fell into line, and implementation has been patchy. Yet the tax may eventually not only bring new fiscal stability, but also reduce the burden of cascading excise and sales taxes that is one of the biggest handicaps facing manufacturers. Modest, piecemeal reform, in other words, is not quite dead.
The government's priorities--investment in infrastructure, agriculture, basic education and primary health care--are also right, given that the big macroeconomic stuff was mostly done in the 1990s. But they all need money, and that requires fixing the budget. India's fiscal deficit is now 8% or so of GDP if both state and central governments are counted--an improvement after six years of double-digit deficits, but still too high. Public finances have been in a mess for so long that it seems almost impolite in government circles to mention them. 
The deficit, which goes largely on interest payments (40% of recurrent spending), defence, subsidies and civil-service wages and pensions, leaves little room for big capital investments. Some new airports, ports and roads are being built, and the ""Golden Quadrilateral"" highway, linking India's four biggest cities, is being expanded to six lanes. But Mr Singh wants a good deal more. Improving India's infrastructure, he says, is his top priority. Hence his government's zeal for ""public-private partnerships"" to finance and construct it. 
A standard concession agreement is to be produced soon, modelled on successes with toll roads, where concessionaires have put in competitive bids for government grants. For some projects, the government does not need parliamentary approval and can proceed anyway. Other projects, however, such as airports, will run into objections from the left. It is therefore hard to see these partnerships making much of a dent in what Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the prime minister's chief planner, calls India's ""infrastructure deficit"".
Might the left-wing parties ever become less obstreperous, and realise that reforms like these are of benefit to all Indians? It is possible. Jairam Ramesh, a Congress member of parliament who played a big role in writing the ""common minimum programme"" that defines relations between the UPA and the Left Front, floats the interesting theory that, now that Congress has enacted the Employment Guarantee Act that the Left was so keen on, the Left may prove a little keener on asset sales. They would, after all, be a way of paying for all those jobs.
From the Left Front come faint signs of accommodation. Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the CPI (M), the most important party within the group, is, like Mr Ramesh, adamant that full-scale privatisation of profitable public enterprises is not on the agenda. But he says the party is ""ready for a discussion"" on how to raise resources for spending on the poor. 
Among the most eloquent advocates of a re-think is, in fact, a senior Communist, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, chief minister of West Bengal, a state of 82m people run for 28 years by the Communists and their allies. On September 30th, the day after Communist-affiliated trade unions had brought his capital, Kolkata to a halt, he could scarcely conceal his exasperation. He told The Economist that the trade unions--and many of his party comrades--had become ""one-dimensional"", representing only the interests of the 30m or so workers in India's ""organised"" sector.
Mr Bhattarcharjee concedes that some of his colleagues in Delhi do not seem to grasp that economic reform could benefit a much bigger number of workers than those who belong to unions. If they do, they perhaps see political benefits in ignoring it. But ""Here, we are running a government. We have to fulfil the aspirations of the people."" To that end, he is trying to turn Kolkata into a hub for the information-technology industry by declaring it a ""public utility"" where strikes are banned, and has started going abroad to bang the drum for inward investment. 
Jobs for the poor
Such enthusiasm may start to shift the political balance back towards reform, but it looks unlikely. For the foreseeable future, both left-wing intransigence and lack of decent infrastructure--in particular, a chronic shortage of electricity--will constrain India's growth. An average annual rate of 6-7%, as in the past decade, does not seem a tall order. But a gear-shift to a durable growth rate of 8-10% still seems out of reach. 
Without it, that burgeoning workforce may seem less of an advantage. Shankar Acharya, a former government economist now at a Delhi think-tank, worries that between now and 2051 nearly 60% of India's population increase will come from four ""populous, poor, slow-growing northern states with weak infrastructure, education systems and governance"".
China has sucked surplus agricultural labour into factories by the tens of millions. India's manufacturing industries, by contrast, have progressed by becoming more productive. They are still not a big source of rural employment. As a good liberal economist, Mr Singh says he does not believe in having an ""industrial policy"" or picking favourites. Create decent infrastructure, and industry will come--and he sees huge potential, as do many others, in food-processing. His finance minister has spoken of 12m new jobs in the textile sector alone in the next five years. 
They are sorely needed. India's information-technology firms are world-beaters, but the entire IT and office-service industry employs only about 1m people. None of the Asian tigers, not even Singapore, managed its rapid climb into the ranks of middle-income and rich countries without a boom in export-oriented manufacturing. India is unlikely to be different. 
When he speaks of following the ""Chinese model"", Mr Singh seems to admit this. But it remains sadly true that the free market that has helped the tigers so much often works better in Communist China than in India--not least thanks to India's own democratically elected Communist politicians.

But they worry that millions of small retailers would be put out of work. For those who want to move out of farm work, a small shop is often their first choice.

IN THE 1970s Japanese ultra-rightists took two goats on a 2,000km (1,250-mile) trip southwest from Tokyo to a group of uninhabited rocks near Taiwan called the Senkaku Islands. In the absence of humans willing to live in such a remote outpost, the hardy creatures would be the vanguard of a new push to solidify Japan's hold over the islets, which are also claimed by China and Taiwan (see map). 
Now the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has signalled a more serious involvement in the dispute, by suggesting on July 6th that he plans to nationalise the privately held chain. On July 11th three Chinese patrol vessels were briefly spotted by the Japanese coastguard in waters near the Senkakus. That led to a flurry of hot-tempered diplomatic exchanges. 
Mr Noda's move is a clear political victory for Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara. In April the famously outspoken nationalist, who has long warned that Japan could become a ""colony"" of China, announced a plan to buy the Senkakus on behalf of the city. A private fund raised 1.3 billion yen ($16.4m) in donations, with pledges of more. The tailwind behind Mr Ishihara's campaign forced Mr Noda off a fence on which most Japanese leaders have sat since 1971. That was when China began to make diplomatic noises about what it calls the Diaoyus. Both countries covet the oil and gas reserves believed to lie under the surrounding waters. 
Mr Noda's idea appears to be the transfer to the state of ownership of three of the five islets--along with the vast herds of offspring of those original goat-colonisers. The owners, the Kurihara family, took title to four of the five islands in the 1970s and pledged to keep them in Japanese hands. ""It has long been our fear that a private local buyer could be a front for a foreign corporation or owner,"" says Hiroyuki Kurihara, who shares Mr Ishihara's conservative politics--and concerns. 
China sees things differently. The day after Mr Noda's announcement, a spokesman in Beijing called the islets ""sacred territory"" and pledged to defend them. (Coincidently, this week Apple appears to have removed a patriotic Chinese iPad application, called ""Defend the Diaoyu"" from its Chinese App store, according to the China Daily, a state-run newspaper.) 
China believes the islands were annexed by Japan as spoils of the 1895 Sino-Japanese War. In 1972, at the end of America's post-war occupation of the Okinawa islands, they reverted to Japan. It refuses to acknowledge the claims of either China or Taiwan. 
Many wonder whether the disputes will escalate. Mr Kurihara thinks not, pointing out that nobody wants a conflict between Asia's two leading trading partners. If there were a tiff, America's security treaty with Japan appears to oblige United States forces to help defend the islands. 
Media reports say Mr Noda may have chosen nationalisation to stave off demands by Mr Ishihara's supporters to deploy Self-Defence Force troops to the Senkakus, risking military escalation. The last time Japan and China faced off over the islands in 2010, Japan blinked first. Amid Chinese protests, Tokyo released a Chinese trawlerman who had been arrested after ramming his boat into two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkakus. 
In pushing for nationalisation, Mr Noda may be trying to prevent further tensions. But if China takes it the wrong way, the stakes will become higher than fish and a few scraggly goats.",A14,Positive,4,,,,3,,3,3,3,3.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

MADRID
Pedro Sánchez tries to combine change, stability and a fragile mandate
WITH unforeseen suddenness, a new political era has begun in Spain. Having ousted Mariano Rajoy, the long-serving conservative prime minister, in a parliamentary censure by 180 votes to 169, this week Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist leader, formed a new government. It will be weak, commanding an even smaller minority in Congress than its predecessor, but not necessarily brief: a general election may not come for at least a year.
Mr Sánchez, a 46-year-old economist, has appointed a cabinet that mixes old faces from previous Socialist administrations with new figures, several from regional governments that his party runs. Its make-up sends three messages. Some are designed to rebut the charge by Mr Rajoy's People's Party that the new prime minister is a hostage to the Catalan nationalists and Podemos, a populist leftist party, whose parliamentary votes helped to bring him to office.
The first message is stability and commitment to Europe. Mr Sánchez has made a virtue of his limited support by pledging to stick to Mr Rajoy's budget (and its target of cutting the fiscal deficit to 2.3% of gdp). This would ""guarantee the governability of our country at an extraordinarily complex moment"", he said in Congress. Raising more than a few socialist eyebrows, he named Nadia Calviño, currently the European Commission's director-general for budgets, as his economy minister.
The new prime minister has not offered to repeal Mr Rajoy's liberalising labourmarket reform, as the unions would like. This reform has helped to spur a rapid fall in unemployment during the past four years of strong economic recovery from the euro crisis. All this means that the political shake-up has caused scarcely a ripple among investors, who are more concerned with Italy's political crisis.
Second, the new foreign minister, Josep Borrell, is an experienced former minister and president of the European Parliament, and also a Catalan. Mr Borrell campaigned against the drive for independence by Carles Puigdemont, Catalonia's former regional president. His appointment signals that the new government will uphold the constitution (which bars secession) and will be more active in making that case abroad.
Third, in a country where feminism is gaining ground, 11 of the new cabinet's 17 members are women. It is a cabinet ""in the image of Spain"", Mr Sánchez said, committed to social and gender equality as well as economic modernisation, with science and innovation as motors.
Such gestures will be an important part of Mr Sánchez's rule, because his scope for bringing about radical change is small. His Socialists, who have only 84 of the 350 seats in Congress, will govern alone. Mr Rajoy's pp had 134 seats and could count on Ciudadanos, a liberal party, with 32.
The ghost of the past
Before calling an election-due in the summer of 2020 at the latest-Mr Sánchez promises to roll back several measures (such as restrictions on freedom of assembly) imposed by the pp when it had a majority, and to which most of the current parliament is opposed. He promised a law requiring equal pay for equal work for women and men, and more efforts to help the long-term unemployed.
Above all, Mr Sánchez brings a breath of fresh air. Polls show that the country had tired of Mr Rajoy. He doggedly hauled Spain out of a deep economic slump with reforms of the broken financial system as well as of the labour market. But the constitutional crisis over Catalonia took its toll on his government. Above all, Mr Rajoy failed to grapple with, investigate or apologise for a steady stream of corruption cases 1 and scandals involving his party.
On May 24th a court found that the pp had run an illegal financing scheme, and that Mr Rajoy's evidence denying this lacked credibility. Since he had often highlighted, in the Catalan context, that Spain's judiciary is independent and the rule of law paramount, that made his position untenable, as Mr Sánchez quickly grasped. Mr Rajoy, a great survivor whose stolid appearance hides sharp political instincts, had been outwitted at last. This week, in a tearful farewell, he resigned as the pp's leader, a post he has held for the past 15 years.
Mr Sánchez is nothing if not daring. Just 19 months ago his political career seemed over, after he was deposed as leader of the Socialist party by its regional barons. They had turned against him following two election defeats, and because he was prolonging a parliamentary deadlock by refusing to allow the formation of Mr Rajoy's minority government. His response was to get into his ancient Peugeot and travel round the country, rallying the party faithful. In May 2017 he got his revenge by unexpectedly winning back his old job in a party primary election.
His position is not without risks. The pp still controls the Senate; it thinks it has been unfairly bundled out of office without an election and promises the incoming government a rough ride. Mr Sánchez said he would try to get a more generous budget passed for next year, but that depends on maintaining his heterogenous base of support. Nevertheless, it is hard to unseat a Spanish prime minister, since the constitution requires a parliamentary majority for an alternative. Mr Rajoy was the first to suffer this fate in 40 years of restored democracy. If necessary, a government can roll over a budget for a second year.
The biggest challenge remains Catalonia. Mr Sánchez supported Mr Rajoy's imposition of direct rule after Mr Puigdemont's unilateral declaration of independence. This week that was lifted as the separatists formed a new government. The prime minister said he wants dialogue, as did Quim Torra, his Catalan counterpart. Mr Sánchez can try to lower the tension, for example by appointing a less militant attorney-general. But creating common ground will take time.
The risk for Mr Sánchez is that his government is seen as a last gasp of the old political duopoly, discredited during the economic crisis as well as by corruption (which has spattered the Socialists, too). The unspoken reason for the success of the censure was that Ciudadanos, riding high in the polls, is the only party wanting an immediate general election; the rest want to avoid one. The Socialists are becalmed at around 20%. Mr Sánchez hopes he will be able to lift that number before going to the country. It is his biggest battle yet. £

WHEN in trouble, ditch the prime minister. This has been a guiding principle of many modern French presidents, who enjoy sweeping powers to change prime minister as they please. Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist president, went through seven; Jacques Chirac, his Gaullist successor, used up four. With his popularity crumbling like a buttery croissant and local elections approaching, Francois Hollande needs a fresh start. But the calculation over a reshuffle is far from simple. 
When voters go to the polls for local councils in late March and for the European Parliament in May, Mr Hollande will face his first nationwide electoral test since winning the presidency in May 2012. Although his Socialist Party will probably retain the Paris mayoralty, the overall result is likely to be crushing. Voters are fed up with Mr Hollande. His poll rating fell in March to 17%, according to TNS Sofres, a pollster, lower than any other modern president at this point in his term. In another poll, which a French newspaper decided not to publish, 56% thought that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the disgraced former IMF boss, would do a better job. 
Mr Hollande's private life has made him faintly ridiculous: he was snapped by the paparazzi on a scooter visiting a French actress, prompting his break-up with Valerie Trierweiler. More worrying, voters do not trust him on the economy after he promised repeatedly, and against the trend, to bring down unemployment by the end of 2013. Latest figures do show a small fall in the fourth quarter, but then another rise in January. The economy remains fragile, with growth forecast at only 1% this year. And France will overshoot its budget-deficit target of 3.6% of GDP in 2014. In a damning assessment on March 5th, the European Commission singled France out for specific monitoring on this score, adding that it needed ""decisive action"" to fix economic weaknesses. 
For a moment in early January it looked as if Mr Hollande was carrying out a bold U-turn, promising a business-friendly ""responsibility pact"" of payroll-tax cuts in return for job creation. But two months on, there is a sense of drift as discussions meander on. The precious mix of inexhaustible energy and authoritative calm seems to elude both the president and his prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault. If it is possible to be a pale shadow of Mr Hollande, Mr Ayrault is it. His own rating, one point below Mr Hollande's, is the lowest for any prime minister at this point in the job since TNS Sofres began polling in 1978. 
As a result, Paris is rife with speculation about an imminent reshuffle, paralysing decision-making further. In recent months, rival candidates to replace Mr Ayrault have been preparing themselves, some more subtly than others. Foremost among them is Manuel Valls, the ambitious 51-year-old interior minister. His blend of social toughness and economic liberalism makes him an unusual Socialist. One recent poll has him as the most popular choice to be the next prime minister--with the most enthusiastic support coming from centre-right voters. With his astute treatment of the media and reputation for decisiveness, Mr Valls could reinvigorate a reformist government. Yet, as he has trampled on his colleagues' ground and displayed too much eagerness for the job, Mr Valls's non-stick quality has begun to wear off. Mr Hollande would find it hard to trust him. 
An Ifop poll now suggests that Mr Valls has lost his place as the most popular member of the government to Laurent Fabius, the foreign minister. Thirty years after he did the job for Mitterrand, Mr Fabius would make an intriguing alternative prime minister. In his current post, he has shown a steady hand and an authoritativeness that goes down well with the public. Yet there is no love lost between Mr Hollande and Mr Fabius, who almost split the Socialist Party in 2005 by campaigning for a ""no"" vote to the draft European Union constitution. Mr Fabius once contemptuously likened Mr Hollande to a woodland strawberry. 
Either man would be risky for the president. Mr Valls wants the presidency itself, and so would be an unpredictable junior. Mr Fabius might not accept the job, and if he did would expect broad executive powers. Which is why other aspirants, such as Claude Bartolone, the parliamentary speaker, and Arnaud Montebourg, the outspoken industry minister, see themselves as candidates. Mr Hollande is keeping his options open. He could go for safety and turn instead to an old friend, Jean-Yves Le Drian, who has done a solid job at defence. He may hope to spring a genuine surprise--or even to stick with the loyal Mr Ayrault. ""Worn out and tired?"" Mr Ayrault said to Le Parisien newspaper in a last-ditch effort to extend his lease. ""Not at all!"" 
Even if Mr Hollande decides to hang on to Mr Ayrault, with a view to replacing him closer to the 2017 presidential election, the odds are that he will still reshuffle the government. The heavier the losses in the elections, the more radical the shake-up. Among those thought to be vulnerable are Vincent Peillon at education and, possibly, Pierre Moscovici at finance. Incomers could include Segolene Royal, Mr Hollande's former partner and a one-time defeated Socialist presidential candidate, and Jean-Pierre Jouyet, another old friend who is head of the new Public Investment Bank. An inspired, if long-shot, choice for the finance ministry would be Pascal Lamy, former boss of the World Trade Organisation. 
A stronger, more experienced team would suggest that Mr Hollande is serious about his new economic policy. A sparser government would help, too; a recent Franco-German joint cabinet meeting embarrassed the French with 37 ministers to Germany's 15. But in the end Mr Hollande needs more than a fresh cast list to fix his popularity problem: he needs results.",A16,Negative,2,,,,2,,2,2,4,2.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

TO HER many fans, Angela Merkel is the hero who stands up to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, and who generously opened her country to refugees. To others, she is the villain whose ill-thought-out gamble on immigration is ""ruining Germany"", as Mr Trump once put it, and whose austerity policies laid waste to southern Europe. 
The fans are closer to the truth. Her country has indeed done well under her leadership and the world been better for her steady hand. But during three terms in office, Mrs Merkel has not done enough to prepare Germany for the future. If her many years at the top are to be viewed as more than merely sufficient, she must use her fourth term to bring about change. 
A steady hand in a turbulent world 
There is little doubt that Mrs Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union are coasting towards victory when Germany votes on September 24th. That is partly owing to the lacklustre Martin Schulz, her Social Democratic Party (SPD) rival. His party's domestic policy is undistinctive and his foreign policy barely credible. He has also failed to put the chancellor on the spot. Their debate on September 3rd was more like the negotiation of a new ""grand coalition"" than a clash of ideas. 
But her imminent victory also reflects how Germany has prospered since 2005, when Mrs Merkel took office (see briefing). Unemployment has fallen from 11.2% to 3.8%; wages are rising; consumer confidence is at a high. The chancellor has stood by the labour-market reforms introduced by Gerhard Schroder, her SPD predecessor--though she has not extended them. She has provided stable and unideological political leadership. German society has become more open and relaxed on her watch; she allowed, for instance, a vote on gay marriage even though she personally opposed it. 
And in trying to cope with the euro crisis and the influx of refugees from the Middle East and north Africa, Mrs Merkel has proved to be the indispensable European. Beyond that, she persuaded Germans that their country should take on more of the responsibilities its size demands but its history makes difficult. At summits she is a calm, well-informed presence, helping to broker European sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and the Paris climate accord. Germany is also taking on international burdens, with troops in Afghanistan, Mali and Lithuania, a scale of deployment unthinkable a decade ago. Her commitment to NATO's target for defence spending of 2% of GDP speaks of a country growing up in the world. 
Yet, for all this, Mrs Merkel has often governed on the ""easy"" setting, especially in her policies at home. She has enjoyed a host of advantages. Mr Schroder's reforms made German workers competitive. The euro, raw materials and borrowing have all been cheap for much of her chancellorship, too. Emerging economies such as China cannot yet make the things Germany does (like luxury cars), so they import them. Germany has the second-oldest population in the world, but its baby-boomer bulge is largely still of working age. The country has been living through a golden age. 
The trouble is that none of the factors that brought this about is permanent. Mrs Merkel had a chance to prepare the country for the future. She has squandered it. Her government's obsession with balanced books has led it to invest too little. The net value of German infrastructure has fallen since 2012. Since 2010 the country's broadband speed has fallen from 12th to 29th in the world. New industries like the internet of things and electric cars are underdeveloped. The mighty German automotive industry took a bad gamble on diesel engines, and is now mired in allegations of faked emissions tests. 
Little has been done to prepare Germany for its demographic crunch. Mrs Merkel's outgoing government not only reversed a raise in the retirement age, but cut it to 63 for some workers and introduced a ""mothers' pension"" for women who took time off to care for children before 1992, benefiting a generation that was already well-catered for. At the same time she did little for those Germans left behind. Inequality and the use of food-banks have both risen on her watch. 
When she does take big decisions, Mrs Merkel has a habit of ducking the consequences. The switch to renewable energy is proving so slow and expensive that Germany's coal usage and carbon emissions are rising--her sudden decision to shut the country's nuclear plants after a meltdown in Japan only made the transition harder. Having helped to hold the euro zone together through a series of weekend crises, Mrs Merkel (along with Wolfgang Schauble, her finance minister) has stood in the way of reforms that would mitigate the next crisis. The task of integrating legions of refugees has been left primarily to cash-strapped state governments and citizens. The chancellor barely talks about them these days, having reduced arrival numbers using a murky repatriation deal with Turkey. 
In the election campaign Mrs Merkel has said little to confront her compatriots with the need to reform governance of the euro, to raise investment and to prepare the economy for a revolution in the nature of work. Instead, her manifesto is vague, and her public appearances have been banal. 
Action needed in Act IV 
And yet Mrs Merkel could accomplish a lot in her next--and possibly last--term. She could use Germany's budget surplus, of EUR 26bn ($31bn) last year and rising, to invest more in human and physical capital. She could look to Emmanuel Macron of France for ideas to strengthen institutions that govern the euro and for a sense of urgency about high-tech. She could cement Germany's foreign-policy credentials, by pressing on towards NATO's 2% goal. Her legacy depends on it. 
Success will partly depend on Mrs Merkel picking the right partners in government. A continuation of the present grand coalition with the SPD threatens yet more sleepy stasis. Instead she should team up with the free-market Free Democratic Party and the Greens--who are wise on Europe and tougher on Russia. Such a coalition would stand a chance of shaking the country up.

For inspiration, he-could do worse than look at steel, the industry where the switch to private ownership started in 1989, and in particular at Acesita, Latin America's largest maker of stainless steel.
Although Brazil is the world's ninth-largest steel maker, the industry was until recently synonymous with losses, overmanning, and political interference. No longer: since privatisation, the top six steel companies have swiftly moved into profit. Nowhere has this revival been more dramatic than at Acesita. In the six years before its privatisation in 1992, the firm lost a total of $600m. By contrast, in the 12 months to August this year, it has clocked up a pre-tax profit of $72m. Its sales have grown from $500m in 1992 to a forecast $670m this year.
Acesita's turnaround has rewarded its new owners, who include the pension funds of two state-owned firms, Banco do Brasil and Telebras, the telecoms monopoly. The firm they bought for $225m of government-debt paper now has a stockmarket capitalisation of $1.1 billion. Most of the workers have gained too. Acesita's new management shed a quarter of its workforce, which totalled 7,600 in 1992, at a cost of $25m in compensation payments. But those who have stayed have seen the real value of their wages rise by 11%.
Wilson Brumer, Acesita's president, says the workers have been ""empowered"". He has abolished time clocks, started training courses and cut three out of seven management layers. His aim is to create ""a firm of 5,300 entrepreneurs all of whom want to be president."" To round off this conversion to modern management fashions, Mr Brumer has now asked McKinsey, a management consultancy, to ""benchmark"" the firm against foreign rivals.
Acesita's return to profit also owes much to Mr Brumer's decision to concentrate production on higher-margin stainless and special steels. The company plans to invest $175m in the next three years to boost output of these lines, and will eventually stop making cheaper carbon steel.
Steel makers such as Acesita have been helped by the anti-inflation plan introduced by Mr Cardoso when he was finance minister earlier this year. As monthly inflation has fallen from 50% in June to below 196 in September, demand for goods like cars and fridges has soared. Thanks partly to Mr Cardoso's election win, many analysts see Brazil as poised for annual growth of 6% for the rest of the decade. And steelmen note that Brazil still uses only 60 kilograms (1321b) of steel per head each year, while America uses over 300 kg.
But such optimism may be premature. With the election out of the way, the government has already imposed credit controls to. curb domestic demand. That is a reminder to firms such as Acesita of the value of exports, which last year accounted for only a fifth of its sales. Its immediate target is to increase its orders from Mercosur, the newly formed free-trade area linking Brazil with Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Acesita's share of the Argentine stainless-steel market was a disappointing 4% in 1992. Today, thanks to a marketing joint venture, this has already increased to 50%.
Baring Securities, a British stockbroker, says that Brazil's steel makers are helped in their export drive by production costs that are only 60% of those of their American competitors. A recent study by McKinsey found that although Brazilian steel workers were still only half as productive as their counterparts in the United States, they were the most efficient in Latin America. The Brazilians benefit from cheap electricity and from plentiful local iron-ore supplies.
That means the steelmen will watch closely what Mr Cardoso decides to do with Companhia do Vale do Rio Doce, a state-owned mining and transport giant that is the world's largest producer and exporter of iron ore. Unlike the steel firms, this company has been fairly well managed by the state. Analyst say that both Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary and Japan's steel makers are interested in buying the company. It could fetch over $8 billion. Having to deal with a privatised supplier of this kind would force Mr Brumer and his colleagues to stay on their mettle.",A18,Positive,4,,,,3,,3,3,4,3.0,,,,0.10279075978101215,0.21052631578947367,0.1637630662020907,0.14191419141914186,0.0840562065641961,0.03154868622005569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5238095238095238,0.16955017301038067,0.35064935064935066,0.2808760606280367,0.6600892799378922,0.21052631578947378,1.0,1.0,0.736842105263158,0.372822299651568,0.2715231788079471,0.4945848375451263,0.6688741721854305,0.6563573883161512,0.5235264982664685

So far Pedro Castillo's presidency is one of trial, error and infighting
When he took office as Peru's president on July 28th, the bicentenary of the country's independence, Pedro Castillo declared that he would not govern from the presidential palace. Built on the site of the house of Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador, the palace is a ""colonial symbol"", he said, which he would turn into a museum. Three months later President Castillo is quietly living and working there after all. It is a sign that whatever Peru's hard-left president might like, the country is not in the throes of revolution.
Rather Mr Castillo's presidency has been defined so far by his political inexperience and indecision, the extremism and infighting of his allies and his weak mandate. A rural schoolteacher, farmer and union activist from a small town in the Andes who had never before held political office, his victory by just 44,000 votes out of 17.5m was a surprise. For his supporters he represents both the Peru that has not shared fully in the country's economic growth and a provincial rebellion against Lima, the capital. He won because politics has fragmented, because the pandemic exposed injustice and neglect and because many Peruvians could not bring themselves to vote for his opponent, Keiko Fujimori, a conservative whose father ruled the country as a corrupt autocrat in the 1990s.
Mr Castillo wasted his first nine weeks in office, appointing a dysfunctional cabinet of the far left that many Peruvians saw as an affront. His own political base is of radical teachers, many close to the former Maoist terrorists of the Shining Path. Police records suggested that the labour minister may have taken part in terrorist attacks. Vladimir Cerrón, the boss of Perú Libre (Free Peru), the party under whose banner Mr Castillo ran, is a Cuban-trained Leninist doctor. Mr Cerrón tried to co-govern through Guido Bellido, his nominee as Mr Castillo's first prime minister, an agitator who publicly countermanded any sign of moderation from the president. Mr Cerrón and Mr Castillo both want a constituent assembly, the device through which other leftist Latin American presidents have imposed authoritarian regimes.
With the government destabilising itself, the currency depreciated daily, pushing up inflation (to 5.2% over the past year). The opposition-controlled Congress began to murmur of impeachment. In early October Mr Castillo ""decided to take some decisions in favour of governability"", as he put it.
For a start, he replaced Mr Bellido with Mirtha Vásquez, a human-rights lawyer and former speaker of Congress. Although she has leftist convictions, she is seen as realistic and consensual. Of a constituent assembly, she said the government ""is not going to propose this for tomorrow"" and that its priorities were vaccination, reopening schools and economic recovery. At the same time Mr Castillo reappointed Julio Velarde, the respected central-bank president, for a fourth five-year term. That calmed the currency market. ""We are leftwing, but we are not going to do crazy things,"" insists Pedro Francke, the economy minister.
The new cabinet is only a marginal im- ?? t provement. The interior minister is a former policeman with a string of (unfair, he says) disciplinary reprimands. As a lawyer he has represented arms traffickers as well as Mr Cerrón (who was convicted of corruption). Only four or five ministers have a reputation for competence. But at least Mr Castillo has bought some time.
Can he use it to achieve change that benefits poorer Peruvians? The government wants to expand tax revenues from 15% of gdp to 17%, to spend more on health care, education and family farming. Mr Francke sees scope to raise taxes on mining companies, which are enjoying high prices, and to crack down on evasion. He has asked the World Bank and the imf to advise on tax reform ""so that it's not anti-competitive"". Whereas Mr Bellido had threatened to nationalise the Camisea natural-gas field, Ms Vásquez's team is studying ways to build pipelines so that more Peruvians can benefit from it.
Brothers in arms, and government
Mr Castillo faces two big problems. He mistrusts ""technocracy, the market, business people and Lima"", says an official who has dealt with him. He shuns the media, preferring rallies with his base in the interior. That mistrust is reciprocated. Many in private business are alarmed, especially by the threat of a constituent assembly. While output has already recovered from last year's slump (though employment has not), lack of confidence means that Peru will be lucky if its economy grows by 3% next year. Lima's once-booming property market is dead. Capital and business people are leaving the country.
The second problem is that the government's diagnosis of Peru's difficulties is mistaken. It is not the market economy that has failed but an inefficient state. Tax collection is low because 70% of Peruvians work informally. In many ministries, Mr Castillo's team are placing supporters in senior posts for which they are unqualifled. That has happened in the social-development ministry, which has a big role to play in ensuring that the 3m Peruvians who fell into poverty last year get out of it. The new education minister is a friend of Mr Castillo, and a former teacher, who wants to repeal a successful reform that requires teachers to be subjected to evaluation and paid according to performance.
Mr Castillo and his supporters reject the idea of ending up like Ollanta Humala, a former president who campaigned as a radical leftist but presided over a mildly social democratic government.

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">What promises to be a bruising election campaign gets under way</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(183,225,205); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">WITH his sights on the G20 leaders' summit in Russia early next month, Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, faced a conflict.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Mr Rudd takes credit for boosting Australia's role in the G20, and is happy on the world stage.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">So after he toppled Julia Gillard as Labor Party leader and prime minister in June, Mr Rudd had hoped to put back Australia's expected date for a general election in order to glad-hand world leaders first.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Yet party barons warned him not to try his luck.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Famous for once ignoring advice, this time Mr Rudd listened.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Dropping his travel plans, he has called an election for September 7th, the day after the summit ends.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Rudd casts himself as underdog in a five-week campaign he says will be &quot;pretty rough&quot;.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">When they reinstalled Mr Rudd as leader, Labor power-brokers aimed to escape the electoral drubbing that opinion polls showed the government faced when Ms Gillard was prime minister.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Rudd led Labor to power in 2007, ending 11 years of conservative government, only to be unseated as leader by Ms Gillard three years later.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">He took his revenge on June 26th to make a comeback as prime minister.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">In spite of Labor's turmoils, Mr Rudd's return has changed the party's game.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(183,225,205); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">It has turned the election into a competitive race against the conservative Liberal-National coalition and Tony Abbott, its leader.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">An opinion poll on August 5th, the day after Mr Rudd announced the election, showed Labor trailing the opposition by just four points, once second-preference votes were counted; the last poll under Ms Gillard had Labor 14 points behind.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Other polls since Mr Rudd's return suggests that the parties are neck-and-neck.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(183,225,205); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Yet turning improvements in the polls into electoral victory will be hard.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">In the 150-seat House of Representatives, where government is decided, Labor holds 71 seats to 72 for the opposition parties.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Two independents in New South Wales who supported Ms Gillard's minority government have stepped down, and the opposition seems likely to win both seats.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Mr Rudd's salvation might lie in Mr Rudd's home state of Queensland.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Voters there turned against Ms Gillard for her knifing of Mr Rudd.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Peter Beattie, a former Queensland Labor state premier, reckons they will reward their favourite son's return with enough seats to offset losses elsewhere, delivering victory to Mr Rudd.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Beattie himself is coming out of retirement to contest an opposition-held seat.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The political terrain is altered by the rise of small parties, such as the WikiLeaks Party, aiming to rob both Labor and the coalition of control of the Senate, the upper house.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">WikiLeaks's seven candidates include Julian Assange, standing for the Senate from the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he is holed up fighting extradition to Sweden.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Labor's campaign also faces an enemy in the two-thirds of Australia's big-city newspapers that are controlled by News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's empire.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Murdoch made his stand plain in Sydney's Daily Telegraph, his most influential tabloid.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Its first edition of the campaign covered the front page with the prime minister's picture and a call to readers to &quot;Kick This Mob Out&quot;.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Some say this fits Mr Murdoch's pattern of backing the candidate he thinks will win (the Telegraph supported Mr Rudd before his victory in 2007).</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">The prime minister himself says the mogul's strategy is commercial.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">He told journalists in Brisbane that Mr Murdoch wanted &quot;his mate, Mr Abbott, in&quot; because a high-speed broadband network the government is building around Australia could &quot;challenge&quot; Foxtel, a cable-television company that News Corporation half-owns with Telstra, a telecoms giant.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(183,225,205); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">But if Mr Rudd has clawed back voters' support, it is partly by racing Mr Abbott to the bottom on issues that resonate in the tabloids' heartlands, notably getting tough with asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Mr Rudd's plan to resettle them in Papua New Guinea, Australia's nearest northern neighbour, seems to have gone down well in Sydney's sprawling, multi-ethnic western suburbs, where Labor faces losses.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Nationally, voters like Mr Rudd more than Mr Abbott: an early campaign poll gave him a 14-point lead as preferred prime minister.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The leaders are likely to slug out most of the campaign over which of them can do a better job on the economy.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(252,232,179)">On August 2nd the Treasury revised its outlook for growth in 2013-14 to 2.5%, slightly lower than its forecast three months ago.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">It projected a A$33 billion ($29 billion) drop in forecast tax revenues over the next four years, partly because of falling commodity prices and a slowdown in China, Australia's biggest trading partner.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">That leaves little room for big spending promises.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">The election could boil down to a contest between &quot;trust&quot;, as Mr Rudd puts it, or &quot;who is more fair dinkum&quot;, in Mr Abbott's spin.</span>

    <h2 class="article-id-A1">ARTICLE SCORES: Positive: 0.23274332284927368 Neutral: 0.14281786978244781 Negative: 0.6244388222694397</h2>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">How not to be Canadian</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">IT HAS long been an article of faith among Canadians--just as it once was among Britons--that their commitment to an easygoing multicultural society protects them from home-grown Islamist terrorism.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">That belief was shattered this month when police charged 12 men and five youths with planning a wave of attacks, ranging from blowing up the Toronto Stock Exchange to storming the national public broadcaster and the Parliament buildings in Ottawa--and beheading the prime minister.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(183,225,205); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">All of the suspects involved were Canadian Muslims from the Toronto area, most of them of South Asian origin and two from Somalia.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">That prompted comparisons with the made-in-Britain London bombings of last July.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">This time, at least, the plot was foiled.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">An anti-terrorist squad from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested 15 of the 17 on June 2nd.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">In a police sting operation, the suspects were held as they took delivery of three tonnes of ammonium-nitrate fertiliser which, the authorities say, they planned to use for bomb-making.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The other two were already in jail, accused of smuggling weapons from the United States.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Several of those arrested were worshippers at a shopfront mosque in Mississauga, a middle-class suburb of Toronto.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The imam was the suspected ringleader.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Even undetonated, the bombs sent shock waves not only across Canada but also across its southern border.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">They have prompted questions about immigration policy and the official approach of fostering diversity rather than integration.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">They are also likely to sharpen debate about the deployment of Canadian troops in Afghanistan, whose removal, it seems, would have been one of the main demands of the accused.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">In the United States, some pundits were quick to seize on the arrests as proof that Canada was a safe haven for terrorists and as justification for tighter border security.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The arrests were not a complete surprise.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The previous week, Jack Hooper, a senior officer of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, told a parliamentary committee that up to 60 groups and about 350 individuals were under surveillance because of suspected terrorist leanings.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">&quot;All of the circumstances that led to the London transit bombings, for example, are now resident in Canada,&quot; Mr Hooper said.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Although Canada had not suffered a significant act of terrorism since the bombing in 1985 of an Air India flight from Montreal, which killed 329 people, he said that there was no room for complacency.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Stephen Harper, the prime minister, has shown no inclination to make political use of the incident, which may dampen its impact.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">He joked about the threatened beheading, saying he could live with such threats &quot;as long as they don't come from my own caucus.&quot;</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Peter Donolo, a political analyst, points out that if Mr Harper's Conservative Party is to turn its current minority status into a majority at the next election, it needs to win seats in cities that are home to large numbers of immigrants.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Playing the race card, something Mr Harper might have been inclined to do in opposition, is not the way to do that.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(183,225,205); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Mr Harper also knows that Canadians strongly support immigration, even though the proportion of foreign-born residents is among the highest in the world.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">A survey last month by Ipsos, a polling company, found that 75% of respondents believed immigrants had a good influence on their country, compared with only 54% in Australia, 52% in the United States and 43% in Britain.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">While suspicion of Muslim immigrants will now doubtless rise, it may not do so by much.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(252,232,179)">&quot;Canadians are cautious and careful about pointing fingers.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">It is our nature,&quot; says John Wright of Ipsos.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The attack is unlikely to cause Mr Harper to change policy towards Afghanistan, where Canada has some 2,300 troops, mostly engaged in security duties in the violent southern province of Kandahar.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">They were sent by the previous Liberal government, but Mr Harper recently sought and won a vote in Parliament to keep them there until 2009.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(183,225,205); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The United States raised its state of alert on the Canadian border.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">But Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, hailed the arrests as &quot;a great success&quot; for Canada's counter-terrorism efforts.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Co-ordination on counter-terrorism between the two countries is &quot;excellent&quot;, she said.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Christian Leuprecht, a security analyst at Canada's Royal Military College, suspects that American officials were tipped off in advance, giving them time to prepare their response.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">He says that, far from straining cross-border relations, the arrests will tend to persuade many in Washington, DC, that Canada is taking terrorism seriously.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">That may not stop some American politicians from making the most of a supposed threat from flabby, liberal Canada.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">In 1999, an Algerian-Canadian was held when he crossed the border in a car containing explosives and timing devices; he was jailed for planning to detonate a suitcase bomb at Los Angeles International Airport.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">After the terrorist attacks of September 11th, American officials temporarily imposed strict checks on vehicles crossing the border.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The latest incident has probably put paid to already slender Canadian hopes of exemption from a law due to take effect in 2008 that will require Americans to hold a passport, rather than just a driving licence, to cross land borders.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Canada remains one of the world's most tolerant countries.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Parliament is reviewing its own security precautions.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">For now, however unjustly, a cloud of suspicion hangs over the country's 750,000 Muslims (2% of the total population).</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">A mosque was vandalised after the arrests, and more such incidents may follow.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">&quot;This is supposed to be a free and democratic society.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">You are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty,&quot; complained the father of one of the accused.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">But Canada was also supposed to be a country where the prime minister ran no risk of losing his head.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">A noisy show trial of the one company actually caught breaking the law may divert criticism from the suspect practices of others in the industry, and at the same time encourage them to mend their ways.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">On cue, JCO had its nuclear licence revoked on October 6th and police raided its offices, looking for evidence that it had behaved illegally.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The reason for this collective outbreak of nerves is that the polls point to an election win for Syriza, a far-left populist party led by Alexis Tsipras.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Although Mr Tsipras says he wants to keep Greece in the euro, he also wants to dump most of the conditions attached to its bail-outs: he would end austerity, reverse cuts in the minimum wage and in public spending, scrap asset sales and seek to repudiate much of the country's debt.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Such a programme seems, to put it mildly, to sit uncomfortably with Greece's continuing membership of the single currency.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Although the economy is now growing again, Greek voters remain understandably enraged that GDP should have shrunk by almost 20% since 2010 and that unemployment is still as high as 26%.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">As it happens, Syriza's poll lead has narrowed in recent weeks, but even if it does not win an outright parliamentary majority, it is likely to be by some margin the biggest party, so Mr Tsipras can expect to lead any coalition government that is formed after the election (see page 21).</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Yet, on the other, he still thinks he can tear up the conditions imposed by Greece's creditors in exchange for two successive bail-outs.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">His reasoning is partly that the economy is at last recovering and Greece is now running a primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments); and partly that the rest of the euro zone will simply give in as they have before.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The notion that EU leaders are so rattled by fears of Grexit that they would pay any price to avoid it was more valid in 2011 and 2012 than it is now.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Faced with such tiny differences between left and right on the big issues of social and economic management, voters tend to plump for the most appealing personalities.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">One big reason why Mr Schroder and Sweden's Goran Persson won while Lionel Jospin, a French socialist, lost is that the winning pair are highly effective politicians while Mr Jospin came across as dull and stiff.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Tony Blair's mastery of British politics relies at least as much on his personality--and his Schroder-like sense of what people want to hear--as on any particular policies.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">It was Mr Blair who made the last real attempt to define a new pan-European (and indeed transatlantic) political Zeitgeist.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">When the centre-left held sway on both sides of the ocean, he earnestly pushed forward his big idea--&quot;the third way&quot;.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Mr Schroder tried briefly to echo him with cosy talk of a &quot;new middle&quot;.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">But the whole Blairite philosophy was too vague to catch on and much of the European left disliked what little it understood of it, assuming it was code for a kind of soft-edged Thatcherism.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Blair has now almost given up talking about the third way.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">In a recent interview in Prospect, a British magazine, he was reduced to claiming that &quot;in parts of Latin America [the third way] is seen as a ground-breaking moment.&quot;</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The most striking recent trend has been the rise of populist parties openly hostile to immigration.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">When Austria's People's Party became the first such party to join a governing coalition, there was outrage across the EU.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">But the rise of politicians making similar appeals elsewhere in other EU countries has muted the outcry.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The Pim Fortuyn list in the Netherlands and Umberto Bossi's Northern League in Italy have both joined governing coalitions after campaigns that highlighted the supposedly bad effects of immigration.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The new centre-right Danish government relies on the votes of an anti-immigration party.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">As Bertel Haarder, Denmark's immigration minister, points out, there may be a connection between addiction to welfarism and hostility to immigrants.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Partly because of high minimum wages and welfare benefits, there are very few jobs for unskilled immigrants: around 60% of them in Denmark have no job.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Struggling in the polls, he decided to express the anti-Americanism that is a strong current of public opinion in Germany and the rest of the EU.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Warning against &quot;adventures&quot; in Iraq and carping at the American economic model was just a mild version of commonplace feelings.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Instead of lauding the audacity of a government that had just imposed direct rule on Jammu and Kashmir, India's most troubled state and its sole Muslim-majority one, Mr Mehta issued a warning.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">We should not cheer the &quot;Indianisation&quot; of Kashmir, he said, but rather fear a creeping &quot;Kashmirisation&quot; of India.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The focus should not be on what Narendra Modi, the prime minister, wanted Indians to see: an assertion of national (read Hindu majoritarian) will and an end to decades of flaccid ambiguity over the territory, which is claimed by Pakistan.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Rather, argued Mr Mehta, it should be on what was meant to remain unseen in Kashmir: the failure of the world's biggest democracy to respect its most basic constitutional responsibility, to seek the consent of the governed.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Now well into his second term, the prime minister seems not only to have kept his Janus face, but to have sprouted the extra arms of a Hindu deity.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Tackling issues that have for decades been cobwebbed by political point-scoring, it has among other things taken bold steps to free farming from state control, untangle stifling labour rules, revise public education and reform the bureaucracy.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">The new regulations on labour, for instance, collapse 44 laws into four simplified national codes.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Even critics of his government concede that, whether or not the specific laws are well-considered, Mr Modi has at least shaken trees that needed shaking and at last shown the mettle to do what he had promised, but failed to deliver, in his first term.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Yet with another hand, Mr Modi pulls a veil over political funding, as well as over the personal &quot;emergency&quot; fund for the prime minister that was set up during the pandemic.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Out of this IT infrastructure has grown a huge business in &quot;outsourcing&quot; almost any business process that can be performed remotely, from answering a call in a help centre to interpreting an X-ray.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The committee, however, has not managed to meet since June, though on October 26th there were rumours that it was about to.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Meanwhile, the Communists--without whom the coalition has no majority in Parliament--are getting truculent.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">They staged a four-month boycott of the co-ordination committee to press their policies and then, in concert with the trade unions, called a one-day general strike on September 29th.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The key battleground is a rule preventing any company with more than 100 employees from making redundancies without obtaining approval from local labour boards.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">According to the Left Front, this protects workers from unscrupulous employers.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">In fact, it makes employers wary of taking on new staff, opening new factories or, in the case of smaller companies, growing beyond the threshold of 100.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">It protects unionised labour, in short, at the expense of those not in work.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Those who are losing out from unreformed labour laws are hundreds of millions of people now marginally employed in the countryside.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">These people need jobs in manufacturing if India is to improve its record on poverty, as well as growth.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Jobs could be found in the labour-hungry textile industry, especially now that, with the ending of the developed world's protectionist Multi-Fibre Arrangement, India's textile exports are booming.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">India's antiquated laws are not only preventing it from exploiting the textile boom as successfully as China (whose textile businesses are so successful that they provoke retaliation).</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">They are also pushing it far behind China in terms of foreign direct investment.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">FDI has been the most important driver of China's growth, not just because of the money involved (more than $60 billion last year) but also because of the technology, expertise, marketing relationships and much else that this money represents.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">India's showing has been far less impressive: about an eleventh of China's haul last year (see chart 3).</span>
    </div>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">One chief reason for the discrepancy is that India imposes caps on FDI in a host of economically important, or politically sensitive, sectors: insurance, aviation, coal-mining, media and much else.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Chief among these is retailing.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Though franchise operations are allowed, foreign direct ownership is banned, which explains why even Delhi's smartest shopping areas are scruffy and chaotic places with limited stock.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Mr Singh's government would like to raise the caps, and had some success at first.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">It proposed in February, for example, that the cap for telecoms investment should be lifted from 49% to 74%, and this has just, at last, been approved.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">But the Left Front is violently opposed to any tinkering with the rules for FDI in retailing.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Its leaders appear to accept that the advent of, say, Wal-Mart would generate many jobs, since much of what the company sold would be domestically produced (Wal-Mart spends $15 billion a year in China).</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">But they worry that millions of small retailers would be put out of work.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">For those who want to move out of farm work, a small shop is often their first choice.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">With the Left Front so adamant, nothing is likely to happen.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">And the same is true of privatisation, or its younger sibling, disinvestment, the selling of minority stakes in state-controlled companies.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">From the very start of its tenure, the government was forced by the Left Front to agree not to privatise nine so-called &quot;crown jewels&quot;, or leading state-owned companies.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">But the Left has taken advantage of its position to go beyond what was originally agreed.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">When, in June, the government announced plans to sell a 10% stake in Bharat Heavy Electricals, an engineering firm, the Left Front vigorously objected.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Although the sale does not require legislation, and so could be enacted by the minority government, the government shows no stomach for doing so.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" style="border-color: rgb(244,199,195); border-style: solid;  border-width: thick">
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Another disappointment--though the word is perhaps inappropriate, since no one ever expected a Congress government to have the necessary courage--is the failure even to attempt to do anything about the mountain of subsidies that distort the Indian economy.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Often badly targeted, benefiting middle-class people more than the poorest, they consume a shocking 14-15% of GDP.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">The biggest is that the Indian economy is so strong, structurally and cyclically, that it can ride out a period of wobbly policy.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">India's young population gives it a fast-growing workforce and a declining proportion of dependants.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Over the next few decades, that will be good for savings and investment.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Industry, meanwhile, has recovered from a splurge of over-investment in the mid-1990s.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">At that point Mr Singh, as finance minister, was given the freedom to bring in reforms by an unexpectedly brave prime minister, Narasimha Rao.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Since then, government has been unable to put an absolute crimp on growth.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Many important reforms--especially trade liberalisation, but also the dismantling of the &quot;licence raj&quot; of bureaucratic obstacles to enterprise--are well in train and not in reverse.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Almost every budget since 1991, including this year's, has cut import tariffs and freed more industries from &quot;reservation&quot; for small firms, a big hindrance to competitiveness in businesses that might benefit from economies of scale.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">This year, moreover, saw the introduction of one long-planned reform, a standardised value-added tax imposed at state level.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Typically, politics meant that not all states fell into line, and implementation has been patchy.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Yet the tax may eventually not only bring new fiscal stability, but also reduce the burden of cascading excise and sales taxes that is one of the biggest handicaps facing manufacturers.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">India's fiscal deficit is now 8% or so of GDP if both state and central governments are counted--an improvement after six years of double-digit deficits, but still too high.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist president, went through seven; Jacques Chirac, his Gaullist successor, used up four.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">With his popularity crumbling like a buttery croissant and local elections approaching, Francois Hollande needs a fresh start.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">But the calculation over a reshuffle is far from simple.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">When voters go to the polls for local councils in late March and for the European Parliament in May, Mr Hollande will face his first nationwide electoral test since winning the presidency in May 2012.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Although his Socialist Party will probably retain the Paris mayoralty, the overall result is likely to be crushing.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Voters are fed up with Mr Hollande.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">His poll rating fell in March to 17%, according to TNS Sofres, a pollster, lower than any other modern president at this point in his term.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">In another poll, which a French newspaper decided not to publish, 56% thought that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the disgraced former IMF boss, would do a better job.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Hollande's private life has made him faintly ridiculous: he was snapped by the paparazzi on a scooter visiting a French actress, prompting his break-up with Valerie Trierweiler.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">More worrying, voters do not trust him on the economy after he promised repeatedly, and against the trend, to bring down unemployment by the end of 2013.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Latest figures do show a small fall in the fourth quarter, but then another rise in January.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The economy remains fragile, with growth forecast at only 1% this year.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">And France will overshoot its budget-deficit target of 3.6% of GDP in 2014.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">In a damning assessment on March 5th, the European Commission singled France out for specific monitoring on this score, adding that it needed &quot;decisive action&quot; to fix economic weaknesses.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(252,232,179)">But two months on, there is a sense of drift as discussions meander on.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">The precious mix of inexhaustible energy and authoritative calm seems to elude both the president and his prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">His own rating, one point below Mr Hollande's, is the lowest for any prime minister at this point in the job since TNS Sofres began polling in 1978.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Foremost among them is Manuel Valls, the ambitious 51-year-old interior minister.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">His blend of social toughness and economic liberalism makes him an unusual Socialist.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">One recent poll has him as the most popular choice to be the next prime minister--with the most enthusiastic support coming from centre-right voters.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">With his astute treatment of the media and reputation for decisiveness, Mr Valls could reinvigorate a reformist government.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Yet, as he has trampled on his colleagues' ground and displayed too much eagerness for the job, Mr Valls's non-stick quality has begun to wear off.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Hollande would find it hard to trust him.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">In his current post, he has shown a steady hand and an authoritativeness that goes down well with the public.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Yet there is no love lost between Mr Hollande and Mr Fabius, who almost split the Socialist Party in 2005 by campaigning for a &quot;no&quot; vote to the draft European Union constitution.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">The heavier the losses in the elections, the more radical the shake-up.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Among those thought to be vulnerable are Vincent Peillon at education and, possibly, Pierre Moscovici at finance.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Incomers could include Segolene Royal, Mr Hollande's former partner and a one-time defeated Socialist presidential candidate, and Jean-Pierre Jouyet, another old friend who is head of the new Public Investment Bank.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">An inspired, if long-shot, choice for the finance ministry would be Pascal Lamy, former boss of the World Trade Organisation.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">A sparser government would help, too; a recent Franco-German joint cabinet meeting embarrassed the French with 37 ministers to Germany's 15.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Acesita's new management shed a quarter of its workforce, which totalled 7,600 in 1992, at a cost of $25m in compensation payments.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">But those who have stayed have seen the real value of their wages rise by 11%.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Wilson Brumer, Acesita's president, says the workers have been &quot;empowered&quot;.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">He has abolished time clocks, started training courses and cut three out of seven management layers.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">His aim is to create &quot;a firm of 5,300 entrepreneurs all of whom want to be president.&quot;</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">To round off this conversion to modern management fashions, Mr Brumer has now asked McKinsey, a management consultancy, to &quot;benchmark&quot; the firm against foreign rivals.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Acesita's return to profit also owes much to Mr Brumer's decision to concentrate production on higher-margin stainless and special steels.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">The company plans to invest $175m in the next three years to boost output of these lines, and will eventually stop making cheaper carbon steel.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Steel makers such as Acesita have been helped by the anti-inflation plan introduced by Mr Cardoso when he was finance minister earlier this year.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">As monthly inflation has fallen from 50% in June to below 196 in September, demand for goods like cars and fridges has soared.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Thanks partly to Mr Cardoso's election win, many analysts see Brazil as poised for annual growth of 6% for the rest of the decade.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">And steelmen note that Brazil still uses only 60 kilograms (1321b) of steel per head each year, while America uses over 300 kg.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">That is a reminder to firms such as Acesita of the value of exports, which last year accounted for only a fifth of its sales.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Its immediate target is to increase its orders from Mercosur, the newly formed free-trade area linking Brazil with Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Acesita's share of the Argentine stainless-steel market was a disappointing 4% in 1992.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Today, thanks to a marketing joint venture, this has already increased to 50%.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">A recent study by McKinsey found that although Brazilian steel workers were still only half as productive as their counterparts in the United States, they were the most efficient in Latin America.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Unlike the steel firms, this company has been fairly well managed by the state.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Analyst say that both Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary and Japan's steel makers are interested in buying the company.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">It could fetch over $8 billion.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Having to deal with a privatised supplier of this kind would force Mr Brumer and his colleagues to stay on their mettle.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">When he took office as Peru's president on July 28th, the bicentenary of the country's independence, Pedro Castillo declared that he would not govern from the presidential palace.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Built on the site of the house of Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador, the palace is a &quot;colonial symbol&quot;, he said, which he would turn into a museum.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">Three months later President Castillo is quietly living and working there after all.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">It is a sign that whatever Peru's hard-left president might like, the country is not in the throes of revolution.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Rather Mr Castillo's presidency has been defined so far by his political inexperience and indecision, the extremism and infighting of his allies and his weak mandate.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">A rural schoolteacher, farmer and union activist from a small town in the Andes who had never before held political office, his victory by just 44,000 votes out of 17.5m was a surprise.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">For his supporters he represents both the Peru that has not shared fully in the country's economic growth and a provincial rebellion against Lima, the capital.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(183,225,205)">He won because politics has fragmented, because the pandemic exposed injustice and neglect and because many Peruvians could not bring themselves to vote for his opponent, Keiko Fujimori, a conservative whose father ruled the country as a corrupt autocrat in the 1990s.</span>

      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Police records suggested that the labour minister may have taken part in terrorist attacks.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Vladimir Cerrón, the boss of Perú Libre (Free Peru), the party under whose banner Mr Castillo ran, is a Cuban-trained Leninist doctor.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Cerrón tried to co-govern through Guido Bellido, his nominee as Mr Castillo's first prime minister, an agitator who publicly countermanded any sign of moderation from the president.</span>
      <span style="background-color: rgb(244,199,195)">Mr Cerrón and Mr Castillo both want a constituent assembly, the device through which other leftist Latin American presidents have imposed authoritarian regimes.</span>

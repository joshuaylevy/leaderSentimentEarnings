The bishop, in a statement issued from a secret address in America, says that he intended to repay the money. In the event, sums equivalent to IRL70,000 ($115,000) were returned to the diocese by rich Catholic benefactors in the days that followed Mr Casey's abrupt resignation, announced at midnight on May 6th.
The credibility of Ireland's Catholic leadership is on the line after the exhumation of Mr Casey's affair with an American divorcee, 20 years his junior. The fact that the affair persisted for 18 months in 1973-74 has shocked Ireland's devout Catholics. This was no mere one-night stand in which some gormless man of the cloth fell into the clutches of a ruthless woman. On the contrary, when Mrs Murphy began to talk to the press, potential sympathy for the bishop evaporated. She painted a picture of a cynical, manipulative man who gave her the cold shoulder when she became pregnant and who tried to force her to surrender the baby for adoption.
Last week Mr Casey was bundled out of Ireland with a first-class, one-way ticket to New York. That he failed to state his side of the story publicly and instead went into hiding has increased the damage suffered by the church, an organisation he has served for four decades.
The affair could have big repercussions in Irish politics. The Irish are likely to vote in three linked referendums next November on matters concerning abortion. The government will make separate proposals to guarantee the right of women to travel to other countries for an abortion and to allow access to information on abortion. The third referendum will deal with the right to abortion itself. The existing constitutional ban has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as allowing abortion in certain circumstances. The government will now have to define those circumstances in law or else move a new provision that would outlaw abortion completely. In the wake of the Casey affair, the advice of the church may not carry the moral authority of old.
The damage to the Irish church will be considerable. The authorities have dealt severely with those who have sinned over the years. Rank-and-file priests who succumbed to the pleasures of the flesh in recent decades were firmly advised to leave the ministry. A church spokesman stated bluntly last week that Mr Casey should have stood down in 1974 when he learned that his mistress was pregnant. Irish Catholics and their priests may now be asking why the church's leaders should seek to impose such a rigid moral code when they have not examined the mote in their own eyes.
Ironically, Mr Casey was among the most liberal of senior churchmen. His outspoken attacks on American policy in Central America caused him to ally himself with the Irish left on many occasions. As a priest and bishop, he worked tirelessly for the homeless and for the poor of the third world. He was not noted for his pronouncements on matters of private morality.
But his style was decidedly flash. He liked to drive BMWs and Mercedes and to eat in expensive restaurants. When the pope visited Ireland some years ago, Bishop Casey was chosen to give the warm-up speech at an outdoor mass attended by 1m of the faithful. The sense of disgrace goes to the very heart of the church. Many Irish Catholics will now wonder what precisely is going on behind the walls of the bishops' palaces.
The British have often identified a riotous sense of fun in Irish people. This is no accident. Before the Roman Catholic church imposed its cold, austere morality on Ireland, the country was regulated by a libertarian legal system, the so-called Brehon laws. Even the priesthood of the early Catholic church agreed to live under this pagan code. Historians assert that the principle of clerical celibacy was enforced in Ireland only from the 12th century onwards because the kept woman of the then archbishop of Armagh refused to surrender his property to the church after his death. She even held on to the bishop's ring."

The pound has powered ahead in the wake of John Major's comfortable return: against a (weakening) dollar it has jumped over 2-1/2%, and in trade-weighted terms it has gained almost 3-1/2% since the beginning of April.
Ever since he signed up the currency for membership of the EC's exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) in October 1990, Mr Major and his colleagues have been struggling to see off the scepticism of the foreign-exchange markets. The politicians said the pound was in the ERM for good, and fixed for good at a central rate of DM2.95; the currency traders smiled knowingly. Now that battle of credibility looks won--not least because the chancellor, Norman Lamont, who was mocked so cruelly during the campaign, never flinched in his commitment to defend the currency. For the moment, a more stable pound and even the prospect of a further cut in interest rates around the corner are the Tories' prize.
Lower rates need not undermine the pound. At the turn of the year, Mr Lamont decided to break ranks with most of his EC counterparts when they pushed up their interest rates in the wake of a tighter monetary policy from the Bundesbank. The chancellor left sterling rates unchanged, and the pound took the strain. But it has done even better since the start of May. It shrugged off a half-point cut in Britain's base lending rates on May 5th, and this week has been trading at around DM2.94.
That half-point cut brought short-term rates down to about 10%. With short-term German rates unchanged at around 9.75%, the pound now offers international depositors a return barely higher than the ERM'S anchor currency--the first time that has been true for 11 years.As the possibility sinks in of stable Tory govemment for the indefinite future--a process helped by another walloping for Labour in the local-council elections on May 7th (see page 80)--currency dealers have begun to ask whether British interest rates might even slip below German ones. And this is prompting braver souls to contemplate a question nobody would have dared mention a few months ago: could sterling aspire to replace the D-mark as the ERM'S anchor currency?
Such a dramatic about-turn would reflect a seismic shift in the economic outlook for the two countries. But it is not impossible to imagine historians writing of 1989-92 as the prelude to such a shift. Germany's struggle to integrate its eastern Lander is going badly--worse than might have been predicted, even by those who criticised the decision to replace the old East Germany's currency with D-marks at a rate of 1:1. A long struggle between the unions and the government over both public-and private-sector wages, all too reminiscent of Britain in the 1970s, looks more likely by the day.
Politically, the contrasting change in Britain's prospects is equally clear--and, thinking back six weeks, equally surprising. If the Major government were to regain control of public spending this autumn, then the implications of Labour's defeat in April might indeed begin to look profound. So a theoretical case can be made for anticipating a change of roles within the ERM. But is there any real chance that the pound might replace the D-mark?
ONLY REMEMBER
For all the excitement over Britain's improving prospects, and the chatter in the stockmarket of a recovery being well on its way, Germany's projected growth rate for 1992 is still superior to Britain's. EC finance ministers meeting on May 9th-10th were given 1992 growth estimates of 2-1/4% for Germany and 1% for Britain.
Nor are inflation-rate comparisons likely to favour Britain in the longer run, which is what matters most for the ERM. Britain's underlying rate of inflation is pointing healthily down: the producer-price index published this week rose only 3.8% in the year to April, against 4.5% in March (though poll-tax increases will ensure that the retail-price index for April, due out on May 15th, will show a slight setback). But the headline rate for German inflation already appears to be heading back towards 3% by the end of the summer.
Nor is it just the minutiae of the monthly statistics that will matter in the markets. Far more important is their accumulated trust in the inflation-busting abilities of the Bundesbank. Set beside the Bundesbank's record, Whitehall's perennial doubts about the merits of an independent central bank are only too revealing. The charts of the long-term movements of the two countries' inflation and interest rates tell their own story; and currency markets have long memories.
All this, though, still leaves open the possibility that British short-term rates might temporarily drop below German ones (as has already happened with rates for the guilder and the Belgian franc). Britain is especially well-placed to pull off this trick because of sterling's broad band in the ERM. This allows the currency more room for further appreciation: if the markets expect the pound to rise within its band against the D-mark, they ought to be readier to accept a lower interest rate on sterling assets than on D-mark assets. The immediate implication is that, if the Bundesbank were to put its rates up in the next month or so, few traders would expect Mr Lamont to match the German rise.
But consider the other possiblity: could Mr Lamont take the initiative and push Britain's base rates below Germany's? This would be riskier, inviting the markets to look more closely at Germany's relative strengths. Some commentators have suggested the chancellor should cut rates sharply. This would put downward pressure on sterling in the short term, they argue, but Mr Lamont could rely on the market's new-found fondness for the currency to pull it gradually back towards its (unchanged) central parity against the D-mark. Investors buying sterling at the bottom could look for a lot more on the capital-appreciation swings than they would lose on the interest-rate roundabout.
There is a snag, though. By gambling with sterling once, Mr Lamont might arouse suspicions that he could do it again. That would colour subsequent predictions, and could send the pound sharply down. That is not the way an anchor currency ought to behave. And who could imagine the Bundesbank acting so cavalierly?"

At the Polytechnic of Wales, an intensive Welsh-language course designed for grandparents is fully booked for 1994. In Pontypridd, in the mouth of the Rhondda--the sort of run-down industrial area where Welsh was seldom heard a decade ago--a third of the primary children can speak Welsh. Down the road in Cardiff, the offspring of Japanese company men are struggling with the tongue of Glyndwr.
Now the Welsh-language movement is about to get another fillip. The Welsh Language bill promised in the Queen's Speech will oblige all public bodies and privatised utilities to give Welsh equal status with English. So if you want to natter about your plumbing or your gas bill in the native argot, you will have a right to do so. Jobs for Welsh speakers are set to boom.
But the biggest break for the language came with the high tide of Thatcherism. Thanks to the 1988 Education Act, Welsh is now becoming a compulsory subject in all schools in the principality. At the same time, the Welsh National Curriculum Council is busy making the rest of the syllabus as Gallocentric as possible. History teachers celebrate Welsh triumphs. Music students revel in the joys of the Welsh harp. Is it any coincidence that the architect of the act, Kenneth Baker, is a Welshman?
Mr Baker. is not Welsh enough for many of his fellow countrymen. Serious activists want as much teaching as possible--of mathematics and the sciences, as well as literature and the arts--to be done in Welsh. About 13% of primary-school children are now taught entirely in Welsh; another 7% are taught in Welsh for at least part of the time.
In Gwynedd and the more rural bits of Dyfed, the education authorities have turned all their infant schools into Welsh-medium schools. To help English-speaking children who move into rural Dyfed, the authorities have provided reception centres were they can be drilled in Welsh for their first couple of months.
All this is not universally welcome, and no wonder. Only one in four inhabitants of the principality speaks Welsh. The areas where it is most common are isolated and rural: Gwynedd and Clwyd in the north, Dyfed in the west.
Many schools along the border (which often attract children from England) and in big towns such as Newport and Swansea (which have no tradition of Welsh speaking) are reluctant to take on the burden of Welsh teaching. English-speakers in Welsh-speaking areas also feel that they they are being turned into second-class citizens. Some parents in Dyfed are so furious that their children have no choice but to go to Welsh-speaking schools that they have appealed to the courts.
Other sceptics worry that the language will crowd out subjects with more clout in the world beyond Wales. Or that the task of introducing the national curriculum is being made harder. Or that schools will not be able to find enough Welsh-speaking teachers. (Teaching teachers Welsh is one of the biggest growth industries in the principality.) Or that it will all cost horrendous amounts of money--starting with L7.6m ($13.8m) in 1991-92 alone.
Welsh-language lobbyists retort that conscription is unnecessary. More and more English-speaking parents are choosing to send their children to schools which teach in Welsh. Even in Anglicised areas like mid-Glamorgan, the Welsh-medium schools are so oversubscribed that more are on the way. Welsh-language courses for adults, using total-immersion methods pioneered in Israel, are taking off all over the place.
The Welsh boosters explain all this in terms of a great revival of national consciousness: people long to speak the language of their great-grandfathers. (And many grandfathers long to speak the language of their grandchildren.)
Alas, the real reason for the revival looks more mundane. Parents realise that Welsh-language schools offer a better education: the teachers are more committed and the parents choosier. The Welsh Nursery School Movement provides a network of superb nursery classes, helped by a grant from the Welsh Office. More important still, if you want a job in today's Wales it helps to be able to speak the language."
16-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224176386/fulltext/5DDB43F255604837PQ/37?accountid=14657,"In his report on Canterbury prison in January 1992, the chief inspector of prisons noted that in the previous year each prison officer had taken, on average, five weeks' sick leave. The management of many of Britain's awful prisons will have to be a target for Kenneth Clarke if he is going to squeeze (as he must) the rising costs of the system while fulfilling the government's commitment to improving standards. That means tackling a body the Tories like to avoid: the Prison Officers' Association.
The Tories have been as wary of confronting the POA as they have been of facing up to the police. A party that sets such store by law and order cannot afford to antagonise its guardians. But the government has much less respect for the prison officers: unlike the police, they have retained the right to strike. Industrial disputes bubble constantly. Several times last year, more than 50 small disputes were running concurrently. (Things have calmed down a bit this year.)
Prison officers know about managerial reforms. ""Fresh Start"", a five-year programme designed to abolish ever-rising overtime costs, introduced in return for a large bribe in 1987, is now in place. Things would be worse without it, but costs have continued to rise. In 1989-90 and 1990-91, a time when the prison population was falling, costs rose by 12% and 13% in real terms.
Some prisons are now decent, well-run places. But quite a few--such as Wandsworth, Pentonville and Leeds--are not. Probably because prisons are closed institutions, a culture of bloody-mindedness can take hold of a place and prove hard to eradicate. Overmanning, for instance, remains curiously persistent, although these days, with no overtime payments, there is no incentive to argue for extra work.
People who know the system explain that prison officers have come to believe the arguments their union once dreamed up to justify more hours. ""Allegations"" is the commonest one: it is used as a pretext for having two prison officers do jobs that one could do. With only one officer, the argument goes, a prisoner might allege that he was doing dodgy things; though why the prisoner should not allege the same about two officers is not clear.
The trouble about manning levels is that there are no objective criteria by which to set them: so much of the work is ""just in case"". Manning levels depend largely on the union's clout. Yet having lots of staff does not necessarily make a jail less dangerous. Steven Twinn, director of The Wolds, a new and privately run prison in Humberside, points out that one officer looking after 50 prisoners (the norm in his jail) will probably chat to them; several officers on one job (the norm in an ordinary jail) will probably stay in an office and talk to each other.
If prison officers are belligerent, it is hardly surprising. The job, though pretty well-paid (the starting salary in London is L16,000--around $29,000), is hard, and living conditions can be rough. Officers get shifted around the country at the prison service's whim; often their families do not move with them, and they end up living in caravans.
The reason for this, and for all sorts of troubles in the prison service, is the centralisation of power: 2,000 people in the Home Office run the budgets and lives of the 32,000 governors, prison officers and auxiliaries working in prisons. A governor, who may have 1,000 people working under him, has no power to hire, fire or promote.
Giving governors responsibility for budgets and people would be a big advance. Then prisons could recruit locally, pay could be set locally and governors who found themselves with a surplus at the end of the year would have no incentive to rush off and spend it. Such a change could follow from the decision, already made, to turn the prison service into one of the semi-independent agencies that the government is carving out of the civil service. But that will not happen unless Mr Clarke pushes it, for both the civil service and the POA will resist.
The idea of resistance from the POA has always sent shivers down the government's spine, and a cave-in has quickly followed. But there are now signs that the ministerial spine is stiffening. Last year, after seven months' work-to-rule at Wakefield, the governor threatened a lock-out and the officers gave up. The question of removing the POA'S right to strike is hovering in the air. Those who argue for such a move point out that they have much in common with the non-striking police and army.
Even so, any likely improvements in the management of the prison service will be overwhelmed unless the current trend in the prison population is reversed. Five years ago, when Douglas Hurd was home secretary, the Home Office understood that Britain, which jails a higher proportion of its population than any other European country, needed to stop sending people to jail for such crimes as first-time burglary. Some changes in the rules and a lot of pointed ministerial speeches directed at the courts led to more bail, fewer custodial sentences and a falling prison population for a couple of years. But Mr Hurd was followed by David Waddington and Kenneth Baker. The climate changed, sentences started increasing, and the prison population began to rise--from 43,000 in early 1991 to 47,000 now.
It is not just liberal lobbyists who argue that the prison population is too high. Both the POA and the Prison Governors' Association argue that there are many people in jail who should not be there. (Prison governors are getting rather cosy with the liberals these days; the governor of Brixton lives with the head of the main let-them-out lobby group, NACRO.) Budget-conscious civil servants are also keen: it costs L300 to keep somebody in jail for a week, compared with L50 for a probation order.
In October this year, new provisions of the Criminal Justice Act come into force that will cut parole and further increase the prison population unless sentences start shrinking. Mr Clarke cannot make the courts pass shorter sentences; but as Mr Hurd's period in office showed, the home secretary can influence them. The Treasury will be most grateful if he does."
16-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224170983/fulltext/5DDB43F255604837PQ/38?accountid=14657,"It never rains, but it pours. Soaked in the general election, Labour has now been drenched at the local polls. Our analysis of the May 7th local-government elections shows Labour's support well down even on that of April 9th, leaving the party with its worst local-election result since 1982. The Tories had their best since 1977.
The environment secretary, Michael Howard, promptly suggested that 1992 could mark a sea change in British politics. This may be a little premature. But the local-election results should dispel any notion that Labour's defeat on April 9th was a temporary setback, inflicted by tax-averse voters ready to return to the Labour fold when asked who should run their local services.
Two regional worries for Labour jump out of the numbers. In the West Midlands, where it lost Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton, the elections confirmed a trend against Labour that could threaten its control of Birmingham in 1994. The Tories in the West Midlands have done better in local than parliamentary elections.
The opposite has long applied in the south: voters there prefer to put Labour candidates into the town hall than into Westminster. The second worry for Labour, though, is that this could be changing. Leave aside Basildon, where Labour did particularly badly. (The Tories won control there, by winning all 15 of the seats up for election.) Compared with last year, the Conservatives achieved a consistently higher swing in the south than in the midlands or the north.
Most worrying of all for Labour, though, must be the absolute decline in its percentage of the total vote. Ignoring the difference in sizes of wards, Labour's vote in a typical English ward in our sample was 6.8 percentage points lower than in 1988. But adding all the votes in the sample together, Labour's share was down a full ten percentage points. (Total turnout was predictably lower: this year nearly 500,000 fewer votes were cast in our sample of English districts than four years ago, and 700,000 fewer than in last year's high turnout.)
Labour's spokesmen were keen to blame their defeat on the assumption that many supporters stayed at home, disheartened by the general election. The turnout certainly fell most in Labour's strongholds; but the same was true of the general election. Indeed, the difference in turnout between Tory and Labour areas was virtually the same on May 7th as on April 9th. But Labour voters appear not to have stayed away more than Tory voters in any one area--and Labour did worst in the south, where the turnout fell least. That sounds familiar."
16-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224148642/fulltext/5DDB43F255604837PQ/39?accountid=14657,"A small, somewhat severe-looking lady wearing electric blue and a Conservative Party hat arrives at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. She pledges her country to the greater Europe. Back in London, recidivist Tory MPS gather at the Carlton Club to conspire over roast beef and claret. They are cross about the trendily cosmopolitan views of the Defender of the Faith and think she has been manipulated by those untrustworthy clever dicks in the Foreign Office. They are going to do something absolutely frightful back, as soon as they can think of what it might be.
Whenever anything mildly interesting happens in British politics, wise columnists feel obliged (and this is a quasi-constitutional requirement) to explain that it was all a ""cock-up"". In this case, the newspapers insisted, the queen had been ""let down"" by a briefing paper about her speech, which indicated she would say that Westminster traditions were ""insignificant"" compared with Euro-democracy. Crusty backbenchers were outraged. Bored journalists blinked awake. The pot, as pots must be, was stirred.
And what happened? When she arrived at the timbered little town, the queen made a faint joke about the ""vigorous"" and ""confrontational"" Westminster debating style and noted, unexceptionally, that differences of style and opinion were insignificant compared with the European commitment to democracy. So it was all the fault of some wretched unnamed briefer in the Foreign Office. He had ""his knuckles rapped"". Nothing to see here. Cock-up. Would everybody please now disperse?
Yes, officer, yes. But just before doing so, a few delinquent thoughts. The queen is no fool. And though her speech was mostly written for her by Euro-enthusiasts in the Foreign Office, she scanned it and amended it with characteristic care. She had wanted to go to Strasbourg for ages. But Margaret Thatcher prevented her. So when John Major took over, and the visit was at last fixed up, the queen considered it quite a significant occasion. Only a symbolic one, of course. But then, what else does she deal in?
The speech was hers as well as the Foreign Office's. Much of the rhetoric (""the European family contains diverse personalities...need for tolerance and mutual support...ties of friendship and co-operation to a wider world"") was eerily familiar--the automatic writing that has disgorged dozens of addresses to Commonwealth summits. But it was not all automatic. This is a sharp and experienced woman who reads the newspapers, and the salty, uncensored stories of parliamentary shenanigans sent to her by a government whip. She probably regards Westminster as a boorish bearpit: there was a gentle dig at British MPS in her speech, and it was surely intended.
The queen's political views are held to be vaguely consensual, leftish Tory. Like the continental monarchs and like her current government, she is a Euro-enthusiast, though she is fitted with anti-lock braking. What else would she be--a child of the war, aware of her country's uncertain place in the world? So those anguished anti-Europeans who claim she had been ""badly advised"", or even used as the puppet for a Foreign Office agenda had better wise up: if there is an Establishment plot, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor is probably part of it.
Thus, her enthusiasm for Strasbourg as ""this ever more important Parliament of Europe"" where there is ""tough talking"" and ""genuine debate"" chimes almost exactly with sentiments expressed by Tristan Garel-Jones, the lead minister on European affairs, in Bonn this week. He said that the British ""have been slow to recognise the growing democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament."" He put down, too, plenty of markers about the three areas of real political difficulty that loom inside the EC: frontier controls, enlargement and the budget. He was full of British pragmatism. But, like the queen, he quoted with relish Winston Churchill's 1946 speech on European union.
Though Mr Garel-Jones did not write the queen's speech, he saw and approved it. The Foreign Office and Downing Street are busy building a Tory consensus on Europe that can be summed up as softly, softly, catchee monkey. That new cliche, ""Tory split on Europe"", will continue to provide headlines, but Tory unity will be enhanced by the rows ahead--as, for example, the one over immigration checks, where Britain's legal position is shaky and may well land it with a challenge in the European Court early next year.
When it comes to ratifying Maastricht next week, the government is in no danger either, since the Liberal Democrats will vote to support the bill and Labour will abstain. Mr Major is secure at home, and in Brussels he enjoys an unchallengeable position as a pragmatic European who will be around for a long time.
So all is for the best, as British influence in a slower-moving more-cautious European Community grows greater? Not quite. The hoo-ha over the queen's Strasbourg speech was a reminder of one consequence of the 1992 election which has not been sufficiently appreciated. It rendered the anti-federalists powerless. They fume in impotence, unlikely to be able to threaten ministers with much effect. And yet they have a point. Mr Major told the Commons this week that ""the sovereignty of this House is not a matter that is up for grabs."" Not quite a whopper--like the old whopper about the Sovereign being sovereign--but a comfortable and distracting irrelevance.
The truth of the matter is that sovereignty is only mumbo-jumbo for ultimate power. In extreme circumstances the Commons, unlike the queen, still has it. But real, usable, day-to-day, power has been ebbing away from the place for years. The queen is far too well-informed not to have noticed. Her Strasbourg speech was a queenly nod of consent. She is also too knowing to take seriously her ministers' nonsense about ""shared sovereignty""--about as meaningless a phrase as ""shared individuality"".
She sees a process that, unless Germany collapses in anarchy or Jean-Marie le Pen moves into the Elysee, will chug on. Mr Major shows no sign of wanting to stop it. One British figure does: another severe-looking lady, with a penchant for electric-blue outfits and Royal hats. She is as determined as ever to scupper the continent-loving establishment. Ah, but she lost, and is powerless."

Like every other country in Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia has eagerly sought to sell many of its state-owned companies to western firms. But recognizing that only a small proportion of its firms would attract a foreign buyer, the Czechoslovaks have spent nearly two years preparing a plan that will virtually give away most of the country's firms by distributing shares in them to millions of its own citizens using vouchers. As other countries have also struggled to privatise thousands of state-owned firms, rumours about Czechoslovakia's voucher scheme have swirled through Eastern Europe. Most reformers called it crazy. Many thought it would never get off the ground.
Czechoslovakia is about to confound the sceptics--or those, at least who scoffed that its scheme would never fly. On May 18th, after repeated delays, the government is due to publish a final list of 1,200 firms whose shares will be sold in a series of computerised auctions over the next few months. The first auction is scheduled to start a week later and continue until June 8th. By the time the auctions finish in the autumn, corporate assets with a ""net book value"" of about 270 billion koruna ($9.3 billion) will have been distributed to millions of new shareholders.
Many expect the latest deadlines to slip yet again, but this time the delay will probably be for only a few days. National elections on June 5th are unlikely to derail the voucher scheme. The right-wing party led by Vaclav Klaus, Czechoslovakia's finance minister and the driving force behind the scheme, is leading in the polls.
Even if Mr Klaus's party does worse than expected, his opponents will find it difficult to suspend voucher privatisation for one simple reason: three out of every four adult citizens have already paid 1,035 koruna, equivalent to one week's average wage, to take part. The voucher scheme will probably go ahead even in hard-hit Slovakia, where increasingly vocal separatists have always argued that mass privatisation would immediately produce mass unemployment. But 2.5m Slovaks are participating in the scheme, which makes it hard for politicians of any stripe to oppose it.
Almost overnight Czechoslovakia will boast the biggest private sector in Eastern Europe--and one of the highest rates of individual shareholding in the world. A second round of auctions is already being prepared for early next year. Another batch of 1,200 firms is due to be selected by mid-August. Other East Europeans will be watching with fascination. Russian officials are already formulating a mass privatisation scheme modelled on Czechoslovakia's.
They will not find it easy. Czechoslovakia's scheme continues to puzzle even the people who have chosen to take part. After paying what was meant to be a nominal sum to participate, each citizen received a booklet of vouchers (known locally as coupons). Each booklet contains slips permitting the participant to bid a total of 1,000 ""points"" in the first auction for all the shares on offer. Initially every share in every company will be priced at the same fixed number of points. The price of unsold shares will be lowered in each subsequent auction until they are all sold. Those shares attracting too many bids will not be distributed. Bidders will retain their points and the shares will be offered again at higher prices until an equilibrium price is found that satisfies all bidders.
Individuals can either bid themselves or give all or some of their points to privately run investment funds in exchange for shares in the fund, whose managers will bid the points they collect and then manage the resulting portfolio of shares. By the time shares are handed to investors in January, bourses in Prague and Bratislava, as well as a computerised over-the-counter market, are supposed to be operating.
Though the voucher scheme now looks unstoppable, it is far from clear that it will deliver economic gains quickly. Privatisation on such a scale has never been attempted before. If it works, many firms suddenly cut off from soft bank credit and government subisidies in the middle of a severe recession (see chart on next page) will promptly go bust. (Chart omitted) But the uncertainty of mass privatisation has been increased even further by two big changes to the scheme since it was first worked out in detail last year: few of the firms in the plan are having all their equity sold via vouchers, as originally planned, and private investment funds will dominate the auctions--a development that has taken the government by surprise.
The first change was a concession forced on the government by company managers across the country, and by their supporters in parliament and various ministries. They argued that stakes in most companies should be kept out of the scheme on the dubious grounds that this would make it easier to negotiate joint ventures with foreigners and to motivate their own workers with share distributions. The size of the stake to be sold in the voucher programme now varies from less than 10% to 97% (with 3% of every firm retained to meet restitution claims). Across all 1,200 firms, the average stake to be sold is 50%.
This is unfortunate. One of the great attractions of the original scheme was that it allowed the government to sidestep the time-consuming and politically fraught process of reviewing each firm's privatisation plans. As it is, the need to review each plan, however hastily, has delayed the programme for months and inevitably laid some government officials open to accusations of corruption.
Critics also fret that many firms, with less than a majority of their equity privatised, will hardly be compelled to change their behaviour. But if the government sticks to its guns and treats such firms as private rather than state-owned, as it has pledged to do, this last worry may not matter that much. Already managers at many big firms are behaving as if the government means what it says, informally courting investment-fund managers who they guess could soon be among their shareholders. If Mr Klaus wins impressively in next month's elections and so is given a freer hand speculates one official at the Czech Republic's privatisation ministry, he will revert to the original plan in the second round and privatise firms wholesale.
The second change to the scheme--the dominant role of investment funds--could prove to be a much wilder card. An advertising blitz last December by the astutely named Harvard Capital and Consulting, a little-known financial conglomerate run by a young Czech emigre, saved the entire voucher scheme from oblivion. The Harvard fund pledged to pay people at least ten times their original 1,035 koruna investment for their voucher points a year after shares began trading. Since each voucher booklet represented a claim on assets worth 25,000-80,000 koruna, this was not a nonsensical offer--provided, of course, that the scheme worked, that the shares became tradable, and that the asset valuations meant something.
Nevertheless Harvard's guarantee alarmed officials. It also caught the eye of a public bored and confused by the government's own clumsy promotion of the voucher scheme. Sales of voucher booklets soared. A horde of other funds followed in Harvard's footsteps, including those run by state-owned commercial banks, nearly all offering similar, or even more generous, guarantees. Now 437 funds have collected two-thirds of all voucher points issued.
There are two ways to view the success of the funds: either as the appearance of western-style financial institutions which will eventually evolve into a genuine capital market, capable of trading, valuing and financing companies; or a recipe for fraud and the immediate collapse of the planned stockmarket. In other words, capitalism or bust."

Now an East Asian economy--as yet only a would-be miracle--is returning the compliment. Vietnam is trying to become the region's newest dragon. And its policy-makers are watching events in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia with more than a passing interest. Many of the economic problems are the same. But the politicians' rhetoric could hardly be more different.
What are Vietnam's chances? Believers in its future argue that it has some powerful assets: a disciplined and well-educated people; a long coastline, so most of the country has access to a port; and what Lee Kuan Yew, the architect of Singapore's rapid growth, calls the ""vital intangible""--the people's determination to pull their country up by its boot-straps.
The challenges are daunting, and the greatest is self-imposed. Vietnam's ruling Communist Party remains committed to Marxist-Leninism: In April a new constitution reaffirmed the ""leading role"" of the Party in all aspects of life and maintained the nonsense that Vietnam is still in transition to socialism it did something else, far more significant: it gave citizens the right to enter into private business.
The cumulative effect of three decades of war and the party's leading role (in the north of the country since 1954, and since 1975 in the south) has been devastating. The country's officials estimate that its GDP per head in 1990 was only $99. Even if, counting the black economy, the true figure was really $200 (as most foreign economists believe), that still makes Vietnam one of the world's poorest dozen countries. Unlike most other poor countries, Vietnam receives no help from the International Monetary Fund or World Bank--part of the price it still pays for having defeated America in war.
The fact that the country has not already collapsed under the weight of its problems suggests the economy is more resilient than it appears, argues Nguyen Xuan Oanh--who has taught at Harvard, worked for the IMF, served briefly as prime minister of South Vietnam and now advises the government in Hanoi. He believes that talk of Vietnam reaching the point of economic take-off will be premature until three things have happened: GDP per head has reached $500; the economy has shown it can maintain a growth rate of 8% a year; and at least half of the country's farm workers (ie, 40% of the labour force) have moved into manufacturing or services.
""We will need at least ten years and $25 billion a year in foreign investment to reach this point,"" says Mr Oanh. Getting there will be tough. In the five years since Vietnam threw open its doors to foreign investment, it has managed to attract only $2.8 billion. And shifting workers out of farming will not be easy because Vietnamese industry is nearly all state-owned, unprofitable and already overmanned. The inefficiency of a Polish-built factory making railway rolling-stock in the Vietnamese countryside has to be seen to be believed.
""It would seem advisable, after the experiences in Eastern European countries, to accomplish a massive privatisation of industry before political and social resistance slows down the process,"" says Mr Oanh. Advisable, quite so--but politically awkward. With unemployment already running at around 20% of the workforce, the government cannot risk throwing more people out of work. Little capital is available domestically to finance privatisation, and the Communist Party has no intention of giving away its few profitable assets. When pushed, economists loyal to the party say they hope to privatise only the unprofitable state-owned enterprises, but are unable to explain why anyone would want to invest in them.
Mr Oanh believes that ""corporatisation"" might be a practical stop-gap measure until privatisation is possible. By this he means allowing the managers, employees and customers of each state-owned enterprise to elect a board, which would then appoint new management. This sounds unwieldy, though it could hardly make matters any worse.
The country can ill-afford half-hearted solutions. The state-owned enterprises are responsible for the larger part of the budget deficit, most of which can be financed only by printing money; the government has no access to credit. Thus inflation is stuck at around 4% a month and threatens to undermine a bold programme of macroreform, which has seen the abolition of multiple exchange rates and the introduction of positive real interest rates for all except state-owned enterprises.
This raises the most controversial question about Vietnam's economic future: would the restructuring of its state-owned enterprises, and hence its whole economy, be faster if America rethought its policy towards the country and stopped blocking loans from the World Bank and IMF? The answer is probably no.
The need for financial austerity has drawn a pragmatic team around Vo Van Kiet, who was made prime minister last year. These men know from experience that central planning does not work and are willing to experiment. They are pushing the sort of policies--encouraging foreign investment, permitting private education and health care--more usually associated with Margaret Thatcher than with a communist party.
Hardliners uncomfortable with these reforms would like to turn back and to guarantee the continued dominance of state-owned enterprises, their main source of patronage. Fortunately they lack the means--and it would better to keep it that way. Instead, if America waits awhile longer, the day will arrive when Mr Kiet's government will be Communist only in name. That will be the time to provide handsome support to economic reform in Vietnam and to place bets on the country's emergence as the next dragon."

He had bought 30% of the company, Australia's largest, and looked set to take it over until the 1987 stockmarket crash. The scars left from fighting him off are still visible on BHP's balance sheet--and, metaphorically at least, on the faces of its senior managers whenever his name comes up.
Yet the attempted takeover was a blessing in disguise. It gave a powerful shove to a restructuring already begun in 1982. Less brutal than Holmes a Court's proposal, and more discriminating, these changes have helped transform BHP from a sleepy steel company into one of the world's more competitive producers of natural resources.
BHP was started in 1885 when deposits of silver, lead and zinc were discovered at Broken Hill in New South Wales (the company's name is short for Broken Hill Proprietary). It began to make steel in 1915 and soon came to dominate Australia's small and highly protected market. It developed iron-ore and coal mines to feed its steel works and export markets, and took a minority stake in the Bass Strait oil field off the southern coast of Australia. Today, with 51,000 employees and a stockmarket valuation of almost A$22 billion ($16.5 billion), BHP towers over all other Australian companies. Like them, however, it suffered from management that was parochial and bureaucratic, and from a unionised workforce that was militant and obstructionist.
The main architects of change were Brian Loton, chief executive from 1984 and soon to become chairman, and John Prescott, the new chief executive. Both, despite spending their whole careers at BHP, realised the scale of the challenge. Over the past decade BHP has invested A$22.2 billion in making its three integrated steel mills in Australia more productive and in expanding its minerals and oil businesses. A reorganisation in 1985 created three big divisions. The group has been profitable throughout the restructuring, and increased its return on equity from 9.5% in 1987 to 16% in 1991.
Mr Prescott ran the steel division from 1987 to 1991. But he is not optimistic about the business's future, given the state of world steel markets over the past ten years. ""If you are responsible for shareholders' funds, then you should look for other activities,"" he warns. Plans to move into large-scale steel production in Asia have been shelved and in future the steel division will have to compete with oil and minerals for capital. Its chances are slim--steel has come close to its targetted return on equity of 5% only once in recent years, in 1989; its return this year will probably be 4%.
Over the past five years, the minerals division has been the star performer. It gained a foothold outside Australia by acquiring Utah International in 1984 and now runs big open-pit mines in eight countries. It is among the world's largest producers of iron-ore, coal and manganese. Its most successful new venture has been a 57.5% stake in the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile, which started producing in 1990. Bob Hickman, the entrepreneurial force behind Escondida, is now in charge of a new team based in San Francisco, charged with discovering, or buying, new mineral reserves all over the the world.
The most dynamic part of BHP is likely to be oil. When Peter Willcox was hired from Amoco to run BHP's oil division in 1987, it was capable of doing little more than handling dividend payments from the Bass Straits field, which was operated by Exxon. So far, Mr Willcox has spent A$5 billion on turning BHP into the world's tenth-largest oil company, measured by proven reserves. Stephen Fabian, an analyst at County NatWest's Australian subsidiary, expects the oil division to make a profit of A$530m in the year ending May 31st 1992, compared to A$659m from minerals and A$209m from steel.
Mr Prescott says he has ""no magic picture"" of what he would like BHP to look like when he steps down a decade or so from now. But he is determined to make it a more global company. There is a long way to go; even after the changes of the past decade, two-thirds of the company's assets and 90% of its workforce remain in Australia.
This leaves BHP uncomfortably exposed to Australia's Luddite unions. Mr Prescott has had considerable success in reducing BHP's labour problems, but centralised wage bargaining and demarcation disputes remain and these may allow the company's international competitors to sprint ahead. Mr Prescott, a hands-on manager (aptly, he lists carpentry as one of his recreations), is also determined to keep costs down. When asked about Holmes a Court's jibe, he says staff numbers at head office--already down to 288--are ""under review, again""."

IG Metall, a German engineering union, threatens to call out its 3.7m members on May 25th if employers do not raise their 3.3% pay offer. So far, Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' association, refuses to budge. But even if peace does break out before the deadline, the once-cosy relationship between capital and labour in Germany will still be in doubt.
IG Metall and other private-sector unions such as IG Medien, which represents print workers, want a higher settlement than the 5.4% rise offered to public-sector workers after their recent 11-day strike. IG Metall has even asked for a 9.5% rise, though it has hinted it would accept a lower figure. The unions point to Germany's trade surplus, which totalled DM4.9 billion ($3 billion) in March, as proof that companies can afford to pay. Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall's boss, blames ""the Rambos"" in the employers' ranks for refusing to compromise.
Gesamtmetall argues that the unusually high trade surplus for March was simply a blip caused by a surge in exports as German companies got rid of stock in anticipation of a lengthy strike that would halt shipments to customers. Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the association's president, has given warning that a big wage rise could cost the industry hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Such mud-slinging is not uncommon in wage negotiations. Yet there are signs of a general worsening in German labour relations. Unification is partly to blame. Higher income taxes in western Germany have stiffened the unions' resolve. They are also betting that a show of strength in western Germany will help recruitment in the east. Employers' attitudes have hardened too. ""We have the feeling that something has changed on the employers' side,"" says Karl Feldengut of the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund, Germany's trade-union confederation. ""They have been so hard, so unwilling to compromise,"" he adds. This new toughness has raised fears that the employers want to modify the social contract that has long governed German labour relations.
These fears may be justified. Though German managers still sing the praises of Mitbestimmung, the system which allows workers' representatives to sit on companies' supervisory boards and share in decision-making, they say that, when it comes to pay and conditions, German unions have lost touch with reality. ""There is a lot of daydreaming going on,"" complains Klaus Steilmann, boss of the Steilmann group, Europe's biggest clothing manufacturer.
Mr Steilmann and other German chief executives worry that Standort Deutschland, or Germany as a manufacturing centre, is becoming increasingly expensive because of German workers' high wages and long holidays (see chart on previous page). (Chart omitted) There have been similar warnings in the past, but this time companies are doing something about it. On May 8th Werner Niefer, the head of Mercedes Benz, said the car company would axe 20,000 jobs or 11% of its workforce.
Germany's car-component suppliers are also in a fix. They agreed to pay rises of 6% in 1990 and 6.7% in 1991, but could not raise prices because car makers were driving hard bargains to keep their own costs down. Those component firms that dared to raise their prices lost business to cheaper foreign Several other branches of the engineering industry suffered the same fate.
No wonder, then, that German employers are presenting such a solid front to the unions. They want to keep pay rises down, at least until they have reduced other costs. The unions are equally determined to keep pay rises up. So if the bill for German unity continues to rise, expect even more disunity at the negotiating table."
16-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224176504/fulltext/5DDB43F255604837PQ/45?accountid=14657,"Music lovers everywhere are about to be bombarded with reasons for replacing their hi-fi, yet again. Matsushita, the world's largest consumer-electronics maker, plans to start selling digital compact cassette (DCC) recorders from September 21st. Philips, the Dutch firm that invented DCC and has collaborated closely with the Japanese giant, will announce on May 20th its plans to launch DCC machines and pre-recorded cassettes this autumn. A dozen other manufacturers are expected to follow suit. Matsushita will sell its initial batch of digital cassette decks for Y135,000 ($1,040) in Japan. But prices are likely to be less than half that within a year or two.
Why should consumer-electronics makers in Japan and Europe launch a product like DCC that could easily cannibalise their business in breadwinners like compact-disc (CD) players? One answer is that sales of CD equipment (though not compact discs themselves) are beginning to flatten out. A second reason is that the two big electronics camps--one clustered around Matsushita the other around Sony--are preparing for another clash. The new DCC format is Matsushita's weapon. Sony's is Mini Disc, a small recordable version of the optical disc used for huge computer archives. Early samples of the Mini Disc's basic components are expected to be shipped to Sony's allies in June. The Sony camp is working hard to announce Mini Disc in time to steal some of DCC's thunder.
But the best reason for DCC's appearance is that retailers have been demanding it. They have had no ""hit"" since small video camcorders arrived in their shops three years ago. Consumers have also been asking for something like DCC. Over half the prerecorded music sold around the world is still on old-fashioned cassettes as opposed to CD or LP records. People like the convenience of cassettes, especially in Walkman-type stereos or cars. Some 3.1 billion cassettes--blanks as well as pre-recorded tapes--are now produced annually. And unlike CDS, cassettes do not skip a beat when jostled. The only problem is that, after hearing the pristine sound of a CD, most people would like cassette tapes to provide the same quality. The only way to do that is to go digital.
The new DCC design is the audio industry's second stab at introducing a digital cassette recorder. The first was DAT (digital audio tape) pioneered by Sony in the late 1980s. A miracle of miniaturisation, DAT recorders worked rather like a video machine (with a recording and playback head spinning rapidly at an angle to the tape). This complexity made DAT machines expensive to manufacture which, together with the high cost of producing pre-recorded cassettes and early fears of prosecution for infringing music publishers' copyright, meant they were doomed from the start. Though barely five years old, DAT is now, in effect, dead. With their crystal-clear sound, the new DCC machines offer the same reproduction quality of a CD player but with all the advantages of a traditional cassette deck--especially the ability to record up to 90 minutes at a time. DCC machines will also be able to play old-fashioned audio cassettes as well (though not, of course, with CD-quality sound). To protect the music industry's copyright, all DCC machines will have anti-pirating circuitry built into them. They will be able to make perfect recordings of a CD, but the copies will be electronically doctored so as to prevent them from breeding further copies.
The consumer-electronics industry has learnt from previous product wars that clever gadgetry is not enough to ensure a hit. The hardware may be technically superior, but it will still flop in the marketplace if not enough software (pre-recorded cassettes or videos) is quickly made available. That means getting the music industry's wholehearted backing for any new format.
This is DCC's hidden strength. Half a dozen of the world's largest record companies have thrown their weight behind it, and prerecorded cassettes for it can be made cheaply on much the same equipment used for churning out conventional prerecorded cassettes. Industry watchers in Japan expect DCC music tapes to retail for less than Y1,700--cheaper than a CD and almost half what they think Sony's prerecorded Mini Discs will cost.
In past epic battles between rival formats, Matsushita's VHS video cassette recorders trounced Sony's Beta machines. Though nobody has yet left the field, the 8mm standard championed by Sony for its palm-sized camcorders looks set to become the eventual winner in the present video battle between the two Japanese giants. But for their next encounter DCC has a head start and most of the manufacturing and marketing muscle is now stacked up in its favour. Sony knows this, but the company is still pressing on with its recordable Mini Disc. As a precaution, though, it has quietly signed an agreement with Philips to share its Mini Disc know-how in exchange for a DCC licence. Discretion, it seems, is the better part of valour."

Indeed, there are signs that air travel is already starting to pick up again--and this, say aircraft makers, means airlines will want about 6,000 new jets worth $400 billion over the next decade. With many airlines still reeling from billions of dollars of losses, some in the industry are not so sure.
One of the sceptics is David James. On May 11th he told members of Britain's Aviation Club, an industry group, that ""a major shakeup is inevitable"". Mr James, an experienced company doctor, reached this conclusion after dealing with his first airline casualty. One of his titles is chairman of Davies & Newman, a British firm whose long-established airline, Dan Air, was losing almost L1m ($1.8m) every day during the Gulf war. After a thorough restructuring it is expected to be profitable next year.
Even with projected growth in air travel of 6% a year, and despite recent cut-backs, Mr James reckons that manufacturers are still planning to build too many aircraft. In the past, he says, manufacturers were able to get away with this because financiers treated aircraft as assets which offered capital appreciation and generated revenue through lease or finance payments. This allowed airlines that had no hope of buying their own aircraft to acquire jets.
Mr James says he has seen other industries become ""heavily dependent on very expensive assets which are beyond the financial reach of the operating companies for whom they are tools of trade."" Shipping and offshore oil rigs were also a fertile field into which leasing firms and financing syndicates poured cash--until massive oversupply led to the collapse of some manufacturers and huge losses for investors.
Now there are signs that this could happen in aerospace. Aircraft values have fallen and hundreds of unwanted jets are parked in deserts. The aviation business is still some way from calamity, says Mr James. But ""the overcapacity problem is sufficiently advanced to demand urgent attention,"" he says. Manufacturers, he says, must cut production even more, to bring it into line with the industry's own revenue-generating capability. And instead of pouring all their money directly into aircraft, urges Mr James, financiers should also back the airlines on whom they depend to operate their assets. On that point, a number of cash-strapped airline bosses are bound to agree."

By the early 1980s, they had come to symbolise the opposite: chronic industrial decline. Once-powerful firms struggled to stay in business, and new foreign competitors (whose costs were but a fraction of the American companies') made ever-deeper inroads into the American market. For domestic steelmaking, like so many other rust-belt industries, there seemed no hope of recovery.
Less than ten years later, things look different. The industry is far more efficient than it used to be, thanks partly to lots of investment. In 1992 American steelmakers use, on average, 5.3 hours of labour to make a ton of steel--less than half of the labour required in 1980. This doubling of productivity means that parts of the industry are now up to world standards. As turnrounds go, steel's has been impressive.
Controversial, too--because for most of the 1980s America's steel industry was heavily protected from foreign competition. Starting in 1982, after a series of anti-dumping complaints against foreign suppliers, the government negotiated a series of ""voluntary"" export restraints (VERS) with the EC, Japan, South Korea and others. The agreements limited the foreign suppliers' share of the American market; thus sheltered, the industry rebuilt itself.
On March 31st the VERS expired, with the industry able to compete internationally. The policy of protection--much criticised by economists at the time--seems to have worked. It gave the industry the time (and extra profits) it needed to adjust. Or did it? On closer examination, the recovery of the American steel industry is a lot more complicated. At great cost, the VERS did have an effect: at least initially, they kept the price of steel in America higher than it would otherwise have been. But protection was only one of several forces shaping the industry--and, perhaps, the least telling. The conclusion that protection works, eagerly drawn by advocates of VERS for other American industries, does not stand up.
JUST A BREATHER
The troubles of Big Steel in America can be traced right back to the 1950s. After the second world war, demand for steel carried on rising, but American producers tried to meet it by expanding capacity piecemeal. Adding smelting capacity in one shop, new finishing capacity in another, they were soon overtaken by Japanese and European producers, who were forced to build new plant from the ground up.
By the 1960s, when Japan was producing steel in new facilities equipped with blast furnaces for continuous casting, American mills were saddled with old technology. Then came inflation, which so raised wage costs that by 1980 American steelworkers earned nearly twice as much as their counterparts in Japan and West Germany. When American steel producers complained in 1982 they were losing more than $100 a ton because of unfair foreign competition, the government responded with its VERS, which from 1984 limited steel imports to about 20% of the American market. A five-year respite, it was argued, would allow American steel manufacturers to modernise. In 1988 producers pleaded they needed still more time to catch up. Visiting Pennsylvania three days before the presidential election, George Bush, then vice-president, reversed his position on steel imports and promised to renew the VERS.
Steel producers spent more than $23 billion on modernisation during the 1980s, with great success. To achieve its doubling of productivity, the industry had to make technological strides, shift toward smaller plants and concentrate on a narrower range of products. Innovation was essential. A largely automated method of continuous casting has replaced the conventional technique for producing steel from ingots; this eliminated a costly stage in the rolling process and improved the yield of finished steel from 70% of liquid steel to 95%.
USX Corporation (formerly United States Steel) once epitomised America's bloated steel behemoths. Its ""Big Mill"" in Gary, Indiana, is still the nation's largest. There 30,000 steelworkers once poured molten metal and stoked the factory furnaces on a 3,400 acre site, to produce everything from railroad tracks to drinks cans. Today workers operate the mill in teams and monitor production by computer. Employment has been cut by two-thirds and the mill concentrates on producing sheet metal. Scaled back and slimmed down, the plant is nearly twice as efficient as the much-improved national average, taking only 2.7 man-hours to roll out a ton of steel.
Many in the industry bemoan the passing of the VERS, because they credit trade barriers with granting the American steel industry time to restructure, and because they believe that further adjustment is still needed. William Hogan, a long-time steelwatcher, says that VERS put the industry back on a competitive footing by enabling producers to invest more than would have been feasible otherwise. True, most of the bill to modernise American steel was actually paid by Japanese companies. Their own steel industry had grown extremely fast in the 1970s; barred by VERS from expanding their import shares in the American market, they bought (and then invested in) American plants instead. Never mind such details, advocates of protection would say, the VERS had the desired effect.
Initially, the VERS did work as the domestic steelmakers wished. Within a year, the share of imports in steel consumption dropped from its peak of 26.4% to 25.2%; and it continued to fall. By limiting steel supply in the American market, the VERS enabled producers to charge higher prices-creating, it is said, a surplus that the companies could use for investment.
But other, and apparently more powerful, factors were also at work. First among these was the sharp drop of the dollar after 1985. The cheaper dollar narrowed the profit margins of producers exporting to the United States and made American output more competitive. The average price for domestic steel rose by only 3% between 1984 and 1990. Foreign steel prices went up much faster--by 25%, in dollar terms.
As the American market became less attractive, the VERS began to lose their influence. After 1985, as a report by AUS Consultants of Media, Pennsylvania, points out, foreign signatories to the VERS failed to fill their quotas, and by a widening margin. Since 1987 imports have fallen 21m tonnes below agreed quotas. This suggests that the fall in steel imports after 1985 (see chart) had more to do with the cheaper dollar than with protection. (Chart omitted)
THE MINI-MILLS ROLL
Domestic competition was the other main force reshaping the industry. The main challengers to America's big steel producers have not been foreigners, but America's mini-mills. Low-cost, non-union producers such as Nucor Corporation and Birmingham Steel have moved beyond products such as nails and fencing-wire to produce even the flat-rolled steel for cars that was once the exclusive domain of the giants. They have also surpassed imports in market share; today they account for 21% of the market, against 18% for foreign producers.
Some of the big firms have greatly improved their efficiency, but the minis are even more competitive. Last year six of America's biggest steelmakers said they lost about $27 on every ton of steel they sold; the minis made a profit of $10 a ton.
Price competition in the domestic market is fierce. The metal is selling at a 30-year low, yet mini-mills repeatedly foil attempts by large producers to push up prices. Despite a 3% increase at the start of April, the cold-rolled steel used in making appliances is selling in America at a discount of more than $250 a ton to its list price. Without the excess capacity of the big producers, and paying their workers between a half and a third of what unionised workers receive, the mini-mills are exemplars of lean and mean. Nucor has made itself a villain by undercutting even discounted prices. Its ability to do so without losing money bears witness to the industry's transformation.
The dollar and domestic competition may have mattered more than VERS in restraining imports and encouraging America's steel industry to modernise, but this is not to say that protection had no effect. In all likelihood, VERS caused foreign producers to flee the American market faster than they otherwise would have. And without protection, steel prices in America would have fallen after 1984, instead of rising modestly. That would have helped steel consumers (ie, American industry) and hurt steel producers. It is an open question whether the steel industry's restructuring in that case would have been faster or slower. The costs to America's economy are less speculative.
According to an estimate made by the Institute for International Economics in the mid-1980s, the steel VERS were then costing consumers roughly $7 billion a year. On the assumption that the restraints would stop about 9,000 jobs from disappearing (in an industry that then employed about 170,000 people), the authors put the price for each job saved at $750,000 a year.
For the future, the VERS' greatest cost may be the dependence on government protection that they have engendered in America's least competitive mills. Anticipating the end of the VERS last year, struggling mills have filed a spate of anti-dumping suits against foreign competitors. Producers of specialty steel and piping complain that foreign producers ""injure"" their industry by selling their steel in the American market at unfairly low prices. Last month, in a preliminary ruling against six of the countries charged, the Commerce Department signalled its intention to enforce anti-dumping laws strictly, now that American steel has lost its import protections.
Proving that a mill suffers injury from a foreign competitor's unfair trade practices is no easy task in an industry plagued by overcapacity and stagnant demand. The American Iron and Steel Institute insists thar cases are never filed frivolously. That does not mean that a competitor's ""unfair"" trade practices are always (or ever) a plaintiff's real concern. One lawyer who specialises in international trade says that, for a struggling mill, $400,000 to bring an anti-dumping suit is money well-spent, even without a final ruling; the process gums up the trade gears sufficiently to steer buyers back to domestic steel.
Despite the expiry of the VERS, actual and threatened anti-dumping actions leave the steel industry a long way from free trade. Moreover, for the moment the global market for steel is depressed, with prices at historic lows. A new multilateral steel-trade arrangement, proposed by some as an alternative to a new batch of VERS, is unlikely to deal with either threat. If the notoriously awful multi-fibre arrangement is any guide, a steel-trade arrangement could easily distort trade as effectively as arrays of VERS. And even a liberal steel-trade deal could hardly be expected to revive global demand for the metal. Only a vigorous economic recovery can do that.
America's steel industry still faces troubled times. But it should be some consolation that large parts of it are now strong enough to stand up for themselves."

It is not about to break that enviable record. Lloyd's has around L18 billion ($32 billion) of declared resources, well above its likely liabilities. But the ranks of aggrieved names--the individuals whose capital supports its underwriting--who would rather sue than pay their losses are swelling. Understandably, prospective customers are starting to ask what the names' obduracy might do to Lloyd's cash flow.
Lloyd's will shortly announce a loss of some L1.6 billion for 1989 (its accounts are drawn up three years in arrears). The following year will see a loss of more than L1 billion, some of which has already led to cash calls on names. Spread evenly among the 30,000 names--8,000 of whom are no longer underwriting, but remain stuck in syndicates with past open-year liabilities--the total would be nearly L100,000 apiece.
But the losses are far from evenly spread. A few lucky names will even make profits. Those on excess-of-loss reinsurance syndicates formerly managed by such agencies as Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire are being caned. Most of these syndicates had an unusually high proportion of external names (those who do not work at Lloyd's), who naturally find it suspicious that insiders avoided them. Eight syndicates will report losses of more than 100% of their premium income for 1989. Perhaps 2,000-3,000 names face bills of more than L500,000 each.
Will they pay? Can they pay? The signs are not good. An outside name must have means of at least L250,000. Each name must also deposit with his agent the equivalent of 30% of the premiums he plans to underwrite. The remaining 70% can be called on demand--as indeed can the rest of a name's possessions, for his liability is unlimited. The use of partly paid capital is a main reason why so many investors were attracted to Lloyd's; most of their capital could be eaming income at Lloyd's even while it was invested elsewhere.
Calling up cash for losses is proving difficult. Just before Easter, nearly 1,000 names unsuccessfully sought an injunction to stop Lloyd's from drawing down their deposits. Next week the Gooda Walker action group, which has more than 2,000 members, will seek a further injunction. Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the group's chairman, reckons that the judgment given before Easter by Mr Justice Saville--who now works nearly full-time on Lloyd's litigation--contains a strong hint that the underwriters may have been negligent. Several other action groups are ready to sue for negligence or even fraud.
Until recently, most names subscribed to the doctrine of ""pay now, sue later"". They were also waiting for the official inquiries into syndicates with losses exceeding 100% of premium income, and for a report due shortly from Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, on the excess-of-loss market as a whole. But the first of the loss-review reports, by Sir Patrick Neill into Feltrim, is not expected to appear before August. And the huge cash calls sent out in March, with more expected in June, have stirred names into new militancy.
Though it deplores the rash of lawsuits, Lloyd's appears to be confident about their outcome. It has recently won most of its cases. Most lawyers reckon that injunctions against drawing down deposits will fail. But suits for negligence, which could take years to resolve, may do better; an action over the 1982 Outhwaite syndicate was settled in March on terms favourable to the names.
Moreover, by June the deposits of several hundred names will be exhausted. The procedure then is clear: if a name will not or cannot pay, the market's central fund, which currently stands at about L500m, steps in. The central fund pursues a civil claim against the name, which Lloyd's says can be enforced even if the name transfers assets to family members or out of the country. Names may appeal to the hardship fund, which allows them to keep a modest house and income. But the central fund gets its money back in the end--in theory.
In practice, civil claims can be time-consuming, especially if a name is bringing other suits himself for negligence. Hence the liquidity problem. Some reckon that by August Lloyd's could find itself as much as L500m short--more than enough to exhaust the central fund, a big chunk of which is anyway earmarked to meet past losses such as those of the 1982 PCW syndicate.
On the face of it, Lloyd's is better placed than most insurance companies. A recent analysis commissioned by Lloyd's from a firm of stockbrokers, Hoare Govett, suggests that the market has stronger reserves and solvency margins than the British composite insurers or American property/casualty insurers. Lloyd's also scores better on net assets as a proportion of technical reserves, a measure meant to show the extra cushion that insurers have if everything goes wrong; but this figure has fallen sharply, and it may fall further after the 1989 results. The market's American trust funds, into which all dollar premiums are paid until the year's accounts are drawn up, is also flush.
Comparisons with commercial insurers are tricky to make, however. Shareholders' funds are fully paid in; names' declared means, counted in Hoare Govett's study of Lloyd's, are not. The Department of Trade and Industry, which has to certify the market's solvency in August every year, accepts declared means as part of net assets. But if a lot of names refuse to hand over those means, will the DTI be so comfortable next time? Even if it is, many banks have learnt that solvency is not the same as liquidity.
Lloyd's ought in a pinch to be able to meet its immediate cash needs. The corporation has assets of L250m, including three big freehold buildings in the City. It has no debts and excellent relations with its bankers, NatWest and Citicorp. Many syndicates have cash put away to meet prospective future claims that might not materialise (after a recent favourable American court case, some are even talking of a ""pollution dividend""). One insider says Lloyd's could be clobbered to the tune of L500m without tumbling into the ditch.
Yet it would be left groggy, with lots more names resigning and precious few offering to take their place. So Lloyd's has two other contingency plans. One is to accelerate the admittance of corporate capital that was proposed in January's Rowland report. Lawyers have now advised that this can be done without amending the Lloyd's Act. But though many companies would be interested--especially as premium rates have hardened significantly this year--how many would be ready to plunge in now?
Hence the second plan--to come up, before the annual meeting in late June, with a settlement for angry names. Talk in the market is of capping their losses at 100% of premiums--the same sort of scheme that the Rowland report proposed for future losses only. The rest would be met by a special loan or by a general levy on names. In return names would have to drop all litigation.
That might not satisfy the disaffected names, many of whom think 100% is still too much to pay. Nor would it appeal to other names who carefully avoided highrisk excess-of-loss syndicates; they cannot see why they should bail out their less cautious brethren. Balancing all these interests will give Lloyd's a torrid summer."

But as well as placating its main bankers, Olympia & York, the world's biggest private landlord, must mollify a host of other parties. There are banks with lesser loans. There are bondholders. There is the law suit with Morgan Stanley. O&Y is like a deadly dull conference: one or two walkouts could cause the whole room to empty.
Start with the main banks. Since admitting to trouble in March, O&Y has called two grand meetings with these lenders. In April it divulged piles of figures on its hitherto secret affairs, and asked for L110m ($195m) in fresh cash to keep going for three months. The banks refused, providing only a drip-feed of new money. On May 5th the company tried again. The big banks have yet to say whether they will provide the $700m now asked of them. O&Y has offered little to encourage generosity.
O&Y divides its creditors into three categories. Lenders to profitable office blocks will continue to be paid interest, though they will be asked to roll over principal. Those which cannot foreclose on top-quality assets will forgo some interest as well as principal. Those exposed to the most troubled bits of the empire--to the parent company in Canada and to the Canary Wharf development in London--are being asked to stump up fresh money.
To soften the blow, O&Y is offering lenders something it calls ""equity"". The prospect of O&Y ceding ownership of up to 20% of the parent company and 30% of the Canary Wharf project has won the intended headlines; after all, O&Y is famously the property of one family, the Reichmanns. But the ""equity"" on offer bears a striking resemblance to high-yield debt.
The proposed ""shares"" would confer no voting rights. They would offer investors little participation in any future success: O&Y would reserve the right to buy them back at a price related to the length of time they had been held, rather than to investors' views of the company's prospects. This buy back option would last seven years; only after that would the shares be listed, bringing O&Y's days as a private company truly to an end. If it came to that, O&Y's days as any sort of company would probably have ended also. O&Y's lenders are being offered real equity in the company only if it fails.
The main banks may also wonder if $700m is really all they will be asked for. Around $180m of that is to tide the Canadian property over a slump in the Toronto office market. The rest is for Canary Wharf. Yet in recent negotiations, O&Y asked for L30m to pay the project's bills for just one month. If costs continued at that rate, the cash would run out somewhere around March 1993. Given that the City's 20% vacancy rate is expected to fall only slowly, there seems little chance of filling Canary Wharf by then. The British government may soon lease space for some 2,000 employees. Even this, however, would reduce the project's vacancy rate only from 40% to 30%.
O&Y says that costs at Canary Wharf will tail off as current work on equipping offices for new tenants is completed. There will be further arrivals, of course, but future tenants will pay more of their own bills. Even so, the money requested from the banks might well run out before Canary Wharf is filled. So Michael Dennis, Canary Wharf's boss, hopes to raise further finance.
Mr Dennis talks of borrowing from institutional investors on the security of Canary Wharf's vast tower, or of selling shares in it. If either of these proved attractive to investors, it is hard to see how O&Y could avoid offering them to its existing lenders first. Mr Dennis's more plausible scheme is to exploit the tax exemptions which Canary Wharf is entitled to but, since it has no profits, cannot use: he would sell leases to investors who are eligible for tax. Such tax shelters are usually sold at the end of the financial year--when the cash O&Y has asked for might well be nearing exhaustion. The shelters could fetch a bit over L200m.
All this hardly thrills the main banks. Other creditors may prove to be even less thrilled. On May 12th J.P. Morgan became the first to foreclose, on a syndicated loan of $160m, and start proceedings to seize collateral. This may unravel an interest-rate swap between O&Y and Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Japan's biggest bank, which is said to save O&Y $1m a month. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley is pressing for $240m from O&Y, which it claims was due in December. On May 14th O&Y lost a court appeal, in which it argued that it need not pay until June 30th.
Bondholders are as tetchy. On May 4th O&Y missed a payrnent of some C$17m ($14m) on a $325m bond issue secured on First Canadian Place, an office tower in Toronto; bondholders threatened to seize collateral if they were not paid by May 14th. In New York the holders of a $548m issue secured on 55 Water Street have been restive; O&Y has called a meeting on May 19th. The next day O&Y will have to do still more explaining, this time to bondholders secured on Toronto's Exchange Tower.
If other creditors start to grab assets, the main banks may feel they ought to follow. They may reflect on the fact that, even if Canary Wharf can be kept going until it is filled, there is no guarantee that rents will be high enough to earn much of a profit. Yet the banks will try everything before pushing O&Y into bankruptcy: the truth is that O&Y's assets are probably worth more with the company than without it. Mr Dennis is likable and clever; if banks seized control, they would most likely manage Canary Wharf no better than he has. And any banker visiting Canary Wharf on a sunny day would have to admit that O&Y is good at putting up fine buildings."

About one square foot in five is vacant. The property slump has rolled around the country along with rising unemployment. Texas and other oil states were hit in the mid-1980s. The north-east's buffeting was more recent, and the effects have spread down to the mid-Atlantic states which accounted for one in three of America's 1.7m lost jobs last year. The once-sunny labour and property markets of southern California and the south-east are clouding over.
Commercial property will take years to recover. Developers from Olympia & York to thousands of small investors made the same bet: that the world's rich economies would continue to create new white-collar jobs in big cities, come what may. In America the buildings went up fastest in the way-stations of the burgeoning global economy, such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, Atlanta and Washington, DC. One in six of America's 15m new jobs between 1983 and 1987 were created there. But the recession that followed was unlike the slump of the early 1980s, when white-collar jobs--and commercial property--were largely unscathed. The recession in the late 1980s hit services hard.
Timing varied from region to region, but American white-collar employment started to slow in 1988. Then it contracted. Developers had been building furiously for years, encouraged by tax breaks from 1981, and then by financiers who paid for more even after those concessions were repealed in 1986. By the end of the decade America was left with 10-20% more commercial property than it needed. Even now, with no new buildings being started, almost 60m square feet of office space are still under construction. Property watchers at Salomon Brothers, an investment bank, expect no improvement in vacancy rates before 1993, and then only a gradual decline from about 18%. Landauer, a New York property consultancy, is more upbeat. It predicts that vacancy rates will stay the same until 1994, but will drop to 10% by 1997.
A thriving economy would help. But demographic trends, especially a slowly growing labour force, will offset any help from that quarter. So, too, may technology, if white-collar America's huge investment in computing in the 1980s yields increased productivity in the 1990s. Salomon Brothers reckons that even if the economy grew at 5% a year through the mid-1990s, it might well create only half the new office jobs each year that were being added in the best years of the 1980s.
Worryingly for developers, economies can recover without pulling up property markets at the same pace. Take Texas, where property values peaked in 1984 before leading the nation into slump. Houston created more new jobs last year than any other city in America but still has vacancy rates that, at 22%, are not far from their worst, in 1987. In Dallas, another of the top ten job-creators, vacancy rates have been rising since the late 1980s and are now higher than 30%.
Texas offers another cheerless message: it took five years for property values there to find their bottom, nearly 40% below their peak. In the past three years prices have barely risen. Cities have yet to replace all the jobs they lost--a fact that New England and New York must find especially depressing. Boston, heart of the construction-led ""Massachusetts miracle"" of the mid-1980s, lost one-fifth more jobs in the past two years than it had created in the previous five. New York lost twice as many jobs as it had created.
Offices have proved a lousy investment. Landauer reckons that investment office buildings have lost 25% of their capital value since 1986, with almost half of that loss in 1991 alone. High vacancy rates pushed real rents down to a point where they failed to offset capital loss. This year promises much the same. The bottom may well not come until 1993, with prices falling another 10-20%.
All that matters now to lenders and borrowers is liquidity. ""Stay alive 'til '95"" is the mantra. While short-term interest rates are low, survivors can mostly muddle through--unless renewing a clutch of mid-1980s leases over the next 18 months gives another downward twist to rents.
At a guess, average real rents are half what they were in 1987. If they fall again, cash flows will be further reduced. With $275m of property loans falling due before June 1993, few bankers or insurers are keen to lend new money. Banks' outstanding property loans fell by $5 billion last year, to $160 billion, and insurers have reduced their property exposure. Getting liquidity back into the property market is its greatest challenge.
The new wisdom is that credit will reappear once some equity emerges to replace the vanished capital of developers and their financiers. There is fresh interest in some 200 publicly traded property investment trusts known as REITS. These are being touted especially to the large pension funds, which want to be sure they can get out as easily as they get in.
REITS own $45 billion-worth of property and raised $1.2 billion of capital in the first three months of 1992--one-quarter of it in equity and most of the rest through pooled debt securities called collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOS). REITS outperformed the S&P 500 index in the first quarter: the National Association of REITS Equity Index rose by 0.7%, while the share index fell by 2.5%.
Salomon expects the primary market for securitised commercial mortgages to top $4 billion this year, against an annual average of $1.3 billion since 1984. With delinquencies (5.9%) and foreclosures (2.9%) reaching record levels, banks and insurance companies are taking over and managing far more property from bankrupt clients than they would like. They are looking at equity REITS and CMOS as a way of adding liquidity to their growing portfolios. One of them is Citicorp, whose chairman, John Reed, says that property is now an ""equity game"". Whatever its name, the potential winnings in this game look sparse for years to come."

Take the case of Osaka-based Sekisui Chemical. Its $300m bond-with-warrant issue expired on April 20th, with all the warrants converted into equity. The company's shares closed that day at Y1,030 ($7.70), just above the warrant's exercise price of Y1,020. On May 8th, however, Sekisui Chemical announced after the stockmarket had closed that its finance subsidiary was sitting on unrealised investment losses of Y60 billion. The news stunned investors, who had been given no warning of any trouble by Sekisui Chemical. On May 11th the company's share price plunged from Y1,100 to Y920, well below the expired warrant's exercise price.
The delayed announcement may have appalled the market but it had some merit for the company: it helped Sekisui avoid refinancing some or all of the expiring $300m issue. Nonetheless, many of its shareholders are not amused to have received no prior hint of the company's plight. Some of Sekisui's foreign owners, who held 10% of the company at the end of September, say they plan to dump their shares on any upward bounce in their price. A spokesman for Sekisui Chemical claims that the parent company learnt of its subsidiary's problems only at a board meeting on April 24th.
Despite its name, more than three-fifths of Sekisui Chemical's operating profits and half of its sales come from housing--a sector that relentlessly optimistic foreign investors have recently been favouring in the hope of anticipating economic recovery. Sekisui's disastrous foray into share speculation is noteworthy even by the often wild standards of Japanese zaitech (financial engineering). Sekisui Finance was established in 1986 ostensibly to manage group finances. At the end of March 1992 it had debts of Y290 billion, of which Y180 billion had been lent by banks and Y90 billion by Sekisui Chemical (interest-free since 1991). Some Y220 billion of the borrowed money was invested in shares, which showed a loss. of Y60 billion on March 31st.
The red ink does not mark the end for Sekisui Chemical; Y60 billion represents only 20% of its shareholders' funds. But it is material damage. Sekisui Chemical plans to provide Y110 billion to its finance subsidiary to repay the bank loans that were invested in shares. Sekisui Finance will have to sell all its shareholding by March 1994, whatever the losses to its parent.
In penance, the president of Sekisui Finance has resigned, and so will the Sekisui Chemical managing director to whom he reports. The subsidiary's 40 employees will be cut to ten. And Sekisui Chemical also faces the expiry of two more warrant bonds, of $300m each. They run out in March and April 1993 with lofty exercise prices of Y1,343 and Y1,476 respectively. Both will probably have to be refinanced.
The Sekisui episode has reminded investors that zaitech shocks can affect any sector of the stockmarket. Another came on May 12th when Yanma Diesel, which makes agricultural equipment, announced that it faced stockmarket losses of Y50 billion because its finance subsidiary had run amok. On this occasion fund managers avoided the pain, since Yanma is a private company. It will be left to Daiwa Bank to pick up the pieces and restructure Yanma's debt."

With its huge trade surplus and long-term capital inflows, Japan is sucking money from the rest of the world. Yet the yen has fallen against most big currencies this year.
In 1991 Japan ran a current-account surplus of $72.6 billion, as imports slumped with demand in a slowing economy. It also enjoyed a long-term capital inflow of $36.6 billion, in part because foreigners bought Japanese securities. The resulting ""basic balance"" (which some economists believe is a rough guide to the underlying demand for a country currency) showed a surplus of $109.2 billion. The yen rose by 7.1% against the dollar that year, and by 9.2% against the D-mark.
Yet the same balance-of-payments trends this year have done less than nothing for the yen. Japan's current-account surplus in March was $11.7 billion, the largest monthly surplus ever reported. Some reckon the surplus will top $100 billion for the year. The long-term capital inflow that month was $8.8 billion, the third largest in history. Foreigners continued to buy Japanese equities, despite falling share prices, and Japanese residents were more inclined to repatriate their long-term assets than to buy new ones abroad (for the first time, notes Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, since the statistical series was started in 1965). The yen has nonetheless fallen by 4.2% against the dollar since the beginning of the year and by 1.1% against sterling, scraping a 2.5% rise against the enfeebled D-mark.
Why? With a booming trade surplus and a vigorous inflow of long-term capital, the outflow of short-term capital, by accounting necessity, has been equally striking: it set a record of its own in March, of $20.1 billion. Japanese banks have been buying billions of dollars to repay their offshore short-term debts.
Between 1984 and 1989 authorised foreign-exchange banks borrowed $212 billion, short term and net, in the Euromarkets. Since late 1990, when declining share prices at home led Japanese banks to conserve scarce capital by cutting back balance-sheet growth, they have been repaying these debts as fast as possible. The banks' short-term net capital outflow was $14 billion in 1990, then $93 billion in 1991, as they reduced their short-term liabilities abroad. In the first three months of 1992, banks ran down a further $43 billion-worth, leaving $63 billion of short-term net borrowings outstanding.
At this rate, notes Salomon, Japanese banks will have repaid their net short-term borrowings in only three or four more months. That will remove some downward pressure on the yen. More may yet emerge, if the Bank of Japan cuts interest rates again. But with domestic demand expected to remain low and Japan's current-account surplus high, the overall prospects must be for a fairly sharp rise in the yen from late summer. Or perhaps sooner: the yen gained 2% against the dollar on May 12th, its biggest one-day jump in months."
16-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224176548/fulltext/5DDB43F255604837PQ/54?accountid=14657,"The battle between Lloyds and HSBC Holdings for control of Midland has so far been a contest of lawyers and lobbyists. Each side has scored victories in its effort to speed its own bid and tie up the other's. The European Commission decided to vet HSBC's bid, disappointing Lloyds, which wanted both offers considered in Britain. The chief of London's Takeover Panel upheld Lloyds' demand for information from Midland, a decision Midland has appealed. The most important ruling yet--by Britain's Office of Fair Trading--is expected shortly. If the OFT suggests that Lloyds' proposed bid be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Lloyds could, but probably will not, withdraw.
Unless the authorities quash Lloyds' offer, Midland's shareholders will decide its fate. The battle for their votes has just begun. Most are indifferent to the welfare of banks' customers and employees, issues that vex politicians. They care about the value of the bids and the prospects for the merged bank. On both counts, Lloyds has an edge. On May 14th Lloyds' proposed offer was worth L4.64 ($8.41) for each share of Midland. That valued the bank at L3.8 billion. Hongkong's firm offer for the 85% of Midland it does not yet own was worth L416 a share, about L400m less. Both are offering mainly their own shares in payment. Lloyds added a bit of cash (30p a share), and Hongkong a bond worth L1 a share (an ingredient that many British investors dislike).
If a bidding war erupts, both contenders have ample ammunition. Their initial offers are low compared with the benefits each claims for its merger. Both start by assuming that, in their care, Midland's dismal earnings would recover to normal levels (about L500m a year, analysts reckon). HSBC, the parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, expects to add a further L300m a year to pretax profits after four years, through cost cuts and other ""synergies""--though interest on its bonds will cost L50m a year. Its proposed investment of L3.8 billion (including L390m for higher taxes and restructuring) would thus produce extra income of L750m a year and an annual return of 20%.
Lloyds should be able to top HSBC's bid because it expects to derive greater additional profits. Lloyds says it will slash L700m a year from the two banks' costs within four years. The return on its investment of about L4.35 billion (including L550m for restructuring) would then be 27%.
However, HSBC has more spare cash than Lloyds: its capital and reserves are two-thirds bigger and its capital-to-asset ratio is 12.2% to Lloyds' 9.7%. True, HSBC would find it hard to raise the share component of its bid. Its shares have lagged the Hong Kong stockmarket since the bid's announcement they would slump if the bank threatened to dilute shareholders' earnings further by issuing more shares to buy Midland. But HSBC could trump Lloyds with cash.
Midland's owners will not sell automatically to the higher bidder. Because the payoff will be mainly in the form of shares, they must ask how profitable each combination is likely to be. Both bidders boast of their profitability. But Lloyds' shares have performed better compared with their local market and its dividends have grown faster than HSBC's (see chart). (Chart omitted)
Lloyds' bid rests on the premise that it will save about 15% of Midland's non-interest costs, by shutting branches, combining headquarters and sharing computers. Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, says bigger savings are ""possible"". His forecast includes nothing for the new income he expects from selling Lloyds' life-insurance policies to Midland's customers.
Nor does it include the revenue Lloyds may lose when it closes branches, HSBC's executives point out. HSBC's pitch is subtler. In addition to synergies worth L300m a year, it offers participation in Hong Kong's money-spinning banking market, a bet on the modernisation of China's economy and a chance to profit from a recovery in the fortunes of HSBC's American and Australian operations. The mix could be potent. Esther Li, an analyst at W.I. Carr in Hong Kong, expects HSBC's profits to grow 30% this year.
Yet Midland's shareholders are sceptical. John Aitken, an analyst at County NatWest, points out that the London stockmarket discounts the Hong Kong profits of big British companies. The market valuation of Cable & Wireless, a telecoms company, appears to discount its Hong Kong earnings by 25%. And some institutional investors who like Hong Kong prefer to invest in companies that are ""pure plays"" in that market. ""You can play that game without investing in a diluted vehicle,"" says one.
Another snag is that HSBC's merger proposal would create two kinds of shares. Midland's shareholders would receive sterling-denominated HSBC stock traded mainly in London; HSBC shares in Hong Kong would retain their Hong Kong dollar denomination. Mr Aitken fears that shares in Britain will lag those in Hong Kong.
Whatever their calculations, Midland's shareholders have the luxury of time. They need not respond to HSBC's offer until early July. Lloyds may drop its bid or, if mired in monopoly talk, even raise it. A new bidder could emerge. The game is still unfolding."

The oddest is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) in the Land, or state, of North Rhine-Westphalia. Unlike its mild-mannered peers, WestLB is known for its aggression, expanding rapidly at home and abroad. Now it faces a backlash from Germany's private-sector banks. They want to restrain this powerful new competitor.
WestLB has grown remarkably fast by Germany's conservative financial standards. Since 1987 the group's assets have risen by more than half, to DM230 billion ($144 billion) at the end of 1991. WestLB could soon overtake Commerzbank as Germany's third-largest bank. So far, this rapid growth has paid off. On May 12th Friedel Neuber, WestLB's chief executive, said its net profits had risen from DM56m in 1990 to DM225m last year, mainly because of a dramatic improvement in interest income.
Under Mr Neuber's stewardship WestLB has in effect become three banks in one. It still performs its traditional role as clearing house for North Rhine-Westphalia's 157 savings banks, providing them with, for example, trade finance and foreign-exchange services. It also acts as a development bank for the region, supporting new businesses and providing housing finance. (These roles are hardly surprising: the savings banks own a third of WestLB's capital, and the state government and other regional bodies own the rest.) Unlike other Landesbanken, however, WestLB is also an international bank.
In 1989 it paid DM450m for the European operations of Britain's Standard Chartered, setting up a jointly owned merchant bank called Chartered WestLB. Hans Peter Peters, a member of WestLB's management board, calls the move ""both offensive and defensive"". The bank had to think European, he says, to stop corporate clients at home from defecting to the three big international German banks, or Grossbanken-Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank.
Chartered WestLB, which earns a 40% return on equity of roughly L60m ($108m), is involved in mergers and acquisitions and other fee-driven businesses, as well as in asset trading and project finance. Its German parent is also raking in fees from its capital-markets activities, like D-mark Eurobonds. Last year WestLB lead-managed eight bond issues totalling DM2.3 billion. That put it fourth in the D-mark league table, just behind Commerzbank. WestLB has set its sights on the ecu-bond market too.
The bank is also looking east. It controls the Deutsche Industrie und Handelsbank, which handled most of East Germany's foreign-exchange business. It is also touting itself as the umbrella institution for the savings banks of Brandenburg, one of the five new German Lander. To extend its reach even farther, the bank's European subsidiary has set up offices in Moscow, Belgrade and Prague, and has bought a minority stake in a Hungarian bank.
As well as taking on Germany's Grossbanken in the east, WestLB is also treading on their toes at home. It pulled off a coup last year by engineering the successful takeover of Hoesch, an ailing German steelmaker, by Krupp. Deutsche, which is Hoesch's Hausbank, or lead bank, got wind of the plan only after Krupp announced that it had secretly acquired a stake in its target. Such big deals are usually reserved for the Grossbanken; WestLB wants to do more of them, using its DM4.4 billion of German shares to gain access to corporate boards.
It is also laying plans to dominate regional banking in Germany. By the end of the decade, say WestLB executives, there will be only three or four Landesbanken. Stiff competition and rising costs will compel the smaller ones to merge. WestLB, which already co-operates closely with Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, based in Stuttgart, is well-placed to mop up its rivals. It hopes to start co-operating with other Landesbanken this year, but will not identify its potential partners.
To continue as ambitiously as it has started, however, WestLB needs fresh capital. There lies the rub. Last September the government of North Rhine-Westphalia said that WestLB could absorb one of the state's banks specialising in housing finance. But private-sector banks made a fuss, claiming that the takeover would amount to an unfair subsidy because WestLB would use some of the housing bank's DM8.8 billion in equity.
The Grossbanken are not alone in hoping the banking commission will block WestLB's advance by denying it access to the housing bank's equity. Other Landesbanken--including Germany's second largest, in Bavaria--also think that Mr Neuber is getting too bold. WestLB, however, is confident that the deal will proceed to its satisfaction. If it does not, Mr Neuber, who happens to be good friends with Johannes Rau, North Rhine-Westphalia's premier, will no doubt find some other way to keep ahead of the pack."

The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index of the top 30 shares fell by almost a third from its peak of 4,547 in early April, to 3,086 on May 12th--still 60% higher than at the beginning of the year-before bouncing back a bit on May 13th, to 3,431. After the revelation on April 23rd that some brokers had been diverting huge sums--perhaps as much as 30 billion rupees ($1.1 billion)--from state-owned banks' coffers into their own and using the money to drive up share prices, the slipping market went into free fall. The bosses of the United Commercial Bank and National Housing Bank have resigned, and some are calling for the head of the finance minister, Manmohan Singh.
The opposition claims that Mr Singh's liberal economic policies are to blame. In fact much blame rests with India's earlier socialism. The government nationalised the bigger banks in 1969 and allowed their trade unions to resist computerizing accounts. Transactions are still entered manually in dog-eared ledgers. It can take days to reconcile accounts within a branch, while transactions between branches and between government banks remain unreconciled for years. Opportunities for fraud are endless.
The bull charge on Indian stockmarkets this year was led by Harshad Mehta, a stockbroker dealing in both government bonds and shares. Because accounting is manual there is a gap between the day a broker receives money from a buyer and the day he passes it on to the seller. Any big broker has the free use of large sums for a few days and may keep rolling them over. Mr Mehta may have done this on the grandest scale, but other brokers are also being investigated.
Many banks rushing feverishly to reconcile their accounts now suspect worse. Banks are the main buys of government bonds, which yield little but must be held to satisfy reserve requirements. They fear that they have paid money against forged ""bankers' receipts"", which banks give each other to register the transfer of government securities. The National Housing Bank, for one, reckons its government-bond trading account is missing more than 3 billion rupees. Investigators claim that false entries in bank ledgers enabled some brokers to siphon away millions for long periods.
Primitive accounting techniques are not the only culprit; banking supervision has also been weak. Belatedly, the Reserve Bank of India is now looking into securities dealings by 18 banks, including four foreign ones--Citibank, ANZ Grindlays, Standard Chartered and Bank of America. The foreigners claim that their accounts are reconciled daily through computerised systems and that they have not provided any significant finance to brokers like Mr Mehta.
India's regulation of stockbrokers also leaves much to be desired. Brokers seem able to shift money with impunity among different trading accounts and from those of clients into their own. Mr Mehta was not simply a broker; he also controlled companies, including one--Mazda Industries--that is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. His transactions helped to send the price of that company's shares from seven rupees in December to 1,650 rupees in April. With his fall, the shares too have crashed; Thousands of small investors who thought the boom would never end have learnt otherwise, to their cost."

It was starting to look forward to what it ought to have been concentrating on all along: helping more than a billion people out of chronic poverty. Then came the Soviet collapse and the request by Russia and 14 other republics to become members. The Bank has seen nothing comparable in scale or nature to the challenge that these command economies now present. Can it cope?
The positive points first. The arrival in September of Lewis Preston, recently retired from a long stint as chairman of J.P. Morgan, America's only big AAA-rated commercial bank, has worked undoubted good. The new World Bank president is a competent manager, if not an exuberant one.
Almost immediately, Mr Preston set about cleaning up the top layers of the bank. ""I find the structure of the Bank quite uncomfortable in its hierarchical rigidities,"" he says. He has replaced a layer of decision-trapping managers with an inner cabinet of three. It meant the loss of talented and visible people, and the occasion allowed personal scores to be settled. But few deny that the streamlining is an improvement.
Mr Preston is also setting up a workable budgeting system, which scarcely exists. He is changing the incentives for loan officers, who have been keener to launch new projects than to see them through. Around $50 billion of the Bank's loans--equal to a quarter of all those it has ever agreed to--has been committed but not paid out.
These changes and more will be needed to cope with the Bank's new members. Nobody knows how much they will need in World Bank loans over the coming decade, but estimates start at an annual $4 billion-5 billion, beginning two years from now. The Bank's private-sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), says that their accession will increase its pace of new investment by half, from a growth rate of 10% a year to as much as 15%. The IFC's head, Sir William Kyrie, calls the rise in investment and staff ""really almost scary"". Outside the IFC, the World Bank says it will need to dedicate 180 people to looking after the Commonwealth of Independent States, and its estimate is probably low. Despite assurances to the contrary, other poor regions fear that talent will be diverted to the CIS.
For all the former Soviet Union's compelling needs and attractions, the World Bank's central purpose is to pursue policies that help to alleviate poverty. For more than a decade the Bank has concentrated on policy-based adjustment lending. Poverty plans have been grinding along with painful slowness. A report on the subject came out two years ago, but it was not until May 11th that guidelines implementing its recommendations were issued. In the foreword to the directive Mr Preston said that reducing poverty was the Bank's ""overarching objective"". Yet such is the bureaucratic machine that it will be years before actual lending practices reflect the shift.
BORED ON THE BOARD
The twin challenges of helping Eastern Europe and attacking world poverty require, more than ever, clear policy-making at the top of the Bank. This is, by and large, lacking. Mr Preston feels uncomfortable leading philosophical debate. And the Bank's most important policy-setting body, its board, has long ceased to function in a way that any commercial company would recognise.
The board's 22 members are divided into those from poor-country borrowers and those from rich-country donors. The latter have the most votes, and the power. But power has often been used for self-serving ends. The United States, the biggest shareholder, long blocked a much-needed capital increase for the IFC. The money was voted through this month, but the United States squandered so much goodwill during the delay that the board has lost what little cohesion it had. One example: board meetings broke up in bickering last week over how to admit the new republics to the IFC.
The Bank's board routinely rubberstamps specific projects but rarely discusses broad policy. On May 12th it approved $130m to build an Indian road; it has never debated the huge and fundamental changes taking place in India's economy at large. ""We were talking about 175 miles of highway,"" says a board member, ""as if it were being laid down in upper New York state.""
Mr Preston himself shows brusque impatience with board meetings--unsurprising, maybe, but dangerous. He rarely asks a director for an opinion. And directors are ""pusillanimous"", as one of them puts it. Rich-country directors, mostly upper-middle-ranking civil servants, know they have little to gain from confronting a Bank president who can get through on the telephone to their bosses, the finance ministers, at any time of the day or night. And poor-country directors hesitate to confront top managers if they think they might jeopardise capital flows to their countries or compromise their comfortable compatriots inside the Bank.
The board's paralysis means that little clear guidance on policy is handed down to line managers. The board does not supervise them, or demand accountability. It does not help make senior appointments, nor is it informed, except very broadly, of managerial pay. The board does not even look at the creditworthiness of the Bank's loan portfolio. For too long it has chosen not to challenge the Bank's top management. Even if that management is now more effective than before, a board with the energy to involve itself could still make the Bank work better. With new challenges to be faced, will things soon change, of necessity?
There are signs that they are doing so already. The board fought to strengthen the directive on poverty. A group within the Bank is looking into reforming board procedures; its recommendations should be bold and swift. This autumn the World Bank needs $18 billion-21 billion to replenish its soft-loan affiliate for the next three years. It will be in no position to quarrel if, in return, its shareholders insist on greater control."

On the surface, it is a wet and windy place. The oceans rage as powerfully as the atmosphere. Their stirrings, though, are poorly understood. Compared with oceanography, weather forecasting is an exact science.
This might seem surprising, since the two disciplines have a lot in common. They are both concerned with the behaviour of large bodies of thinly spread fluid. The difference is that whereas the oceans cover 70% of the planet's surface, the atmosphere covers 100% of it, including the bits where people live. That means people are interested in the weather. Few, apart from sailors, pay much attention to the sea.
That is changing at least among scientists. Fishermen and their friends are given to describing the seas as a vast storehouse. As well as storing food, they also store large amounts of heat and carbon dioxide (CO sub 2 )--both of which matter to climatologists. Tracking the movement of these two things has given oceanography the stimulus, and the money, it needed to bloom. New equipment is being designed, satellite launches planned, and cans of alphabet soup (WOCE, the World Ocean Circulation Experiment; JGOFS, the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study; and, ultimately, GOOS, the Global Ocean Observation System) are being stirred. into the currents.
As the acronyms suggest, the emphasis is on collecting data from all over the world. The old way of doing oceanography with a few expensive cruises is giving way to a new ""drift-net science"", in which huge amounts of data are gathered from as wide an area as possible. Floating probes are being thrown into the ocean by the hundred. Satellites scan all seven seas, listening to the probes or monitoring things themselves.
The probes are oceanography's weather balloons--they go with the flow in a global game of Pooh-sticks. Some float on the surface. Others, of carefully calculated density, sink to a particular level and then drift with the deeper currents--poorly understood and often at odds with their superficial siblings.
There are two sorts of sinking probe: cheap and simple; not-so-cheap and clever. Both sorts have to overcome an obstacle which physics has put in their path. Water is opaque to radio waves and, for that matter, to light. The ocean depths are dark and silent. To reveal what it has learnt in those Stygian currents, a probe must surface.
A cheap, simple probe is essentially an alarm clock and a radio transmitter. The clock is set for anything from six months to five years. When it goes off, the instrument jettisons a weight and bobs to the surface. The radio transmitter then starts up, announcing to a passing satellite--normally one of America's weather satellites--where the probe is. Toss enough probes overboard, at $1,700 a throw, and with time you can get some idea of whither, and how fast, the undersea currents are flowing.
Clever probes tell you more. They use sound waves, which travel extremely well underwater, to communicate with beacons fixed to the sea floor. In some cases the beacons broadcast and the probes work out where they are every few days by listening to the nearest beacons. They then store the information until it is time to surface and reveal, not just where they are, but also how they got there. Other probes talk to the beacons and rely on them to pass the word on; these probes need never surface at all.
All these fancy probes cost a lot ($3,700-15,000) but yield much more data. They can map ""mesoscale eddies"", which are to the oceans what storm systems are to the atmosphere. A few hundred kilometres across, eddies are the things from which larger ocean currents are made. These currents are responsible for about half of the heat-flow from the equator to the poles. That ""about half"" could be a quarter; it could be three-quarters. With figures as basic as these in doubt, it is impossible to make plausible forecasts of the planet's climate. One of the goals of WOCE, which supervises most of today's probe-dumping, is to get a better grip on these figures.
SOURCE FOR THE GOOS
Satellites can do much more than listen for the chirpings of probes. Though physics conspires to stop them looking into the ocean deeps, they can study its surface in many different ways. WOCE is about to launch a satellite to do just that. TOPEX/Poseidon is a Franco-American effort due to lift-off from French Guiana in July. The radar it carries should be able to map the level of the sea to within 2cm; that should be good enough to pick up the slight variations caused by the currents.
Floating probes and satellites like TOPEX/Poseidon should help to discover how heat moves around. Another trick will enable scientists to take the ocean's temperature and see whether the overall amount of heat is increasing. The speed of sound in water depends upon how hot the water is; so measuring how long a noise takes to get from A to B is like sticking a thermometer in the sea--or, rather, like stringing a line of thermometers through the depths and taking the average.
In 1991 a group of scientists, led by Walter Munk of the Scripps Institution in La Jolla, California, tried this out in a big way. They broadcast noise from Heard Island in the southern Indian Ocean to 18 receiving stations around the world, the farthest being 18,000km (11,000 miles) away near Seattle. All the stations heard the signal loud and clear. A series of such reports would, in theory, allow the measurement of temperature changes of a few thousandths of a degree a year, enough to see the year-on-year changes which global warming might bring. The group now hopes to start a decade-long experiment, beginning in 1993 with broadcasts from California to New Zealand, and eventually incorporating a world-wide network of stations. Some scientists interested in marine mammals have worried that this may deafen their charges. To lessen their fears, Dr Munk is turning down the volume.
The other climatic variable at the mercy of the oceans, CO sub 2 , moves in and out of the sea at the whim of the creatures that breathe and photosynthesise near the surface. JGOFS exists to study these whims. At the moment it uses ships to study plankton but it, too, should soon get a satellite. In 1993 the Orbital Sciences Corporation, based in Virginia, will launch a satellite called SeaStar. This will carry an instrument called SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field Sensor) which will monitor the colour of the sea, showing scientists where plankton are growing. OSC has agreed to sell the SeaWiFS data to NASA for $43.5m--an intriguing new way for governments to catch data.
So far JGOFS has mainly studied the north Atlantic, though it is now extending its net to the Pacific and Antarctic. Scientists co-ordinated by Michael Whitfield of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England, have studied how the amount of CO sub 2 in the top few metres of the ocean varies. In the spring, small plants called diatoms bloom and grow, using up CO sub 2 as they do so and making room for more of it to dissolve from the atmosphere. Diatoms are eaten by fish, so some of this CO sub 2 ends up being removed from circulation, dropping to the bottom of the ocean as--well, as droppings. JGOFS has provided new detail on this, and turned up a surprise. Coccolithophores (more small, floating plants) bloom at more or less the same time; they use CO sub 2 to make their shells and were thus expected to reduce its level still further. But their shell-making leaves the water near the surface slightly more alkaline. CO sub 2 does not dissolve well in alkaline water. So the growth of coccolithophores, unlike that of diatoms, reduces the amount of gas the oceans absorb.
WOCE, JGOFS and their like are intermediaries. They pave the way for GOOS and its atmospheric partner, the Global Climate Observing System. These should be flying, floating and drifting into existence in about ten years time. John Woods, of Britain's Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), hopes GOOS will net about 100 times more data than are landed today--enough to test supercomputer models of how the oceans work. It will require better equipment and more money, perhaps $2 billion a year.
At NERC, they have already laid their plans. They are designing DOLPHIN (Deep Ocean Long Path Hydrographic Instrument), a robot submarine powered by a fuel cell, which will be capable of crossing an ocean, of diving as deep as 6km, and of resurfacing every 30km to talk to satellites. Much of DOLPHIN is still at the design state, but the transmitter is already finished. Casting around for something to test it on, NERC turned to its zoologists. They had just the thing--as large and ocean-going as DOLPHIN is hoped to be, though a little more difficult to handle. So elephant seals are the latest recruits to the grand alliance of oceanographers."

However, Joseph Kirschvink at the California Institute of Technology has just announced that he has found within them a smattering of the hard stuff--magnetite, a crystalline mineral made of iron and oxygen. His discovery raises a number of intriguing questions, and one potentially disquieting one.
Dr Kirschvink has spent much of his working life looking at magnetite. He and others have discovered this powerfully magnetic mineral in all sorts of creatures. Salmon grow magnetite crystals, as do bees and pigeons. Some molluscs use magnetite to give a cutting edge to their teeth; some bacteria have the little crystals strung out through their bodies.
The human brain contains only a small amount of magnetite; that it was found at all is a tribute to Dr Kirschvink's skill and his singular dedication to the cause of magnetite. He and his colleagues, Atsuko Kobayashi-Kirschvink and Barbara Woodford, isolated tiny crystals of the mineral--between 10 and 200 millionths of a millimetre across--from liquefied brain tissue. They also showed, using exquisitely sensitive instruments, that the magnetic field from lumps of frozen brain tissue is the sort that you would expect from magnetite. They think brain tissue is, on average, four parts in a billion magnetite by weight.
What might this mean? Dr Kirschvink and others have long suspected that magnetite might enable animals to use the earth's magnetic field as a navigational tool. That some animals do use the field is not in doubt--whether they use magnetite to do so, though, is moot. Magnetite is a plausible basis for a sense of direction--it is the substance from which natural lodestones are made--but nature may have chosen to do things differently.
As yet, nobody has established a physiological pathway by which the effect of a magnetic field on a piece of magnetite in a cell leads to a signal being sent down a nerve. Perhaps the most suggestive clue is the finding that, in some birds, signals running down the opthalmic nerve--which is linked to an area where magnetite has been found--are influenced by local fields. Other research, though, seems to show that the pigeon's magnetic sense depends on its eyes, and vanishes in total darkness; not something one would expect from a system based on magnetite. It is possible that both lines of work are correct, and that pigeons have two ways of measuring magnetic fields.
At least nobody doubts that pigeons have some magnetic ability; that is more than can be said for humans. In the 1980s Robin Baker, of the University of Manchester in England, performed experiments with students taken on magical mystery tours in buses, and others spun round in chairs, that seemed to show an innate sense of direction. The experiments have been widely criticised, mainly by American researchers. In turn, Dr Baker has criticised his critics. An impasse has been reached. Dr Baker takes the silence to mean he has won by default; his critics, when prompted, insist he has not.
There are creatures, though, which undoubtedly use magnetite to make their way through life guided by the earth's magnetic field. These are the magnetotactic bacteria, which contain strings of magnetite crystals more or less indistinguishable from those now found in people. The bacteria align themselves with the earth's magnetic field; in high latitudes this allows them to know which way is down, and thus to burrow into the ooze they love.
Seeing bacteria make magnetite crystals like those he finds all over the animal kingdom has led Dr Kirschvink to the unorthodox view that a similar bacteria was the common ancestor of all complicated life forms. The ""eukaryotic"" cells which such life is made from are much bigger and more complex than bacterial cells; it is thought that they came about when some bacteria learnt to swallow others, the internees being transformed in the process into specialised ""organelles"" within the bigger cell. Dr Kirschvink says magnetite-carrying bacteria have the attributes that the swallower would need. Carrying those crystal grains means that such bacteria are big--which the common ancestor would have to be--and have some sort of skeleton, to keep their insides in order, another helpful feature.
Animals may have inherited a biochemical way to make magnetite or discovered the trick for themselves, but that does not mean they use it to read magnetic fields. It may just be a way to store or dump excess iron. But magnetic fields and magnetite could still have a role in human biology: a damaging one. Some people have speculated, on the basis of contested epidemiological studies, that magnetic fields produced by power lines and some sorts of electrical machinery might be associated with cancers. Although the presence of magnetite in human brains proves nothing, it does at least suggest the possibility of a mechanism by which some such fields could have a biological effect."
16-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224167398/fulltext/5DDB43F255604837PQ/60?accountid=14657,"The demise of the Hindenburg, greatest of the Zeppelins, demonstrated what a prodigious amount of energy hydrogen can store; it also gave hydrogen a lasting reputation for danger. There exists a fine technology for liberating hydrogen's energy--the fuel cell, a device similar to a battery that takes in oxygen and hydrogen and produces electricity and water in a highly efficient and environmentally friendly way. To use it, though, you need a storage method that is seen to be safe and cheap. At the end of April a worldwide patent was filed for a method which provides such storage in an ingeniously round-about way. The secret is to mix iron and water.
There are plenty of ways to store hydrogen, but each has its faults. Compression and liquefaction tend to be expensive or wasteful. Metals that can absorb hydrogen and later release it are easily contaminated. Today's favoured trick is to store methanol instead, and convert it into hydrogen as and when the fuel is needed. But methanol is toxic and releases small amounts of atmospheric pollution.
The new method comes from a 20-strong company called H Power, which is based in New Jersey--close, as it happens, to the spot where the Hindenburg met its end. The firm's idea is, in outline, similar to that of storing hydrogen in the form of methanol, but works with more commonplace materials and machinery: a coarse powder of iron, water and a little heat. Water and iron react together slowly and ceaselessly, as anyone with a rusty car can testify; the reaction between them (called oxidation) will normally happen quickly only at around 700degC. With the addition of the right catalyst, though, a lower temperature--about 100degC--will do the trick. The iron strips out the oxygen in the water molecules to make rust. That gives off gaseous hydrogen, which can then be used for anything you like--such as powering a fuel cell in a car.
What do you do with the rust? The best idea is to turn it back into iron. All chemical reactions are reversible to some extent. Rusting is quite highly so, under the right conditions. Oxidation gives off only a little energy (which is why things rust slowly); that means its reversal, a process called reduction, need use only a little energy. So you can imagine a system which makes hydrogen from water and iron, burns the hydrogen, carries the resulting rust to another place, and there converts it back to iron. The energy given off by burning hydrogen will be less than that needed to reduce the rust and complete the cycle--but not much less.
The efficiency of the reduction, and the amount of pollution produced, depend on what is used to do the reducing. Hydrogen can be used, to produce water and iron, but then the hydrogen must be produced in some way. One way is partially burning natural gas. That gives off hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO), which can also be used for the reduction, as can carbon itself. In such a process about 55% of the energy in natural as emerges as hydrogen; the other 45% is lost. This is at least as efficient as converting methanol into hydrogen.
A cycle in which iron produced hydrogen in a fuel-cell driven car, and was then reduced back to iron by natural gas would give off only about half as much CO sub 2 as simply burning petrol in a car, mainly because fuel cells are far more efficient than petrol engines. Pollution could also be given off elsewhere. With strict controls on urban air pollution, it could make sense to burn hydrocarbons outside cities and ship their energy in as iron.
There are even cleaner methods of reducing the iron. For example, using reducing gases made from crop residues or sustainable biomass--plants that are replaced as they are harvested--would produce little overall air pollution. There would be none at all if the reduction reaction was driven by electricity generated from wind, solar power or nuclear reactors.
A likely home for H Power's technology might be in some of California's vehicles: by 2003 the state wants 10% of new cars to emit no polluting gases. The idea is that motorists would fill their cars with iron and water and use the hydrogen generated to power a light electric motor based on fuel cells. Once the iron is used up, the motorist would unload his rust-bucket at a filling station and buy some fresh iron.
According to Robert Williams of the Centre for Energy and Environmental Studies at Princeton University, the performance of a possible fuel-cell vehicle could compete on price with a vehicle powered by petrol if its durability and reliability are taken into account. H Power's calculations suggest that an iron-car with a range of 400km (250 miles) or so would be fairly heavy, because each kilogramme of iron would generate enough hydrogen to propel the car only 6km. On the other hand, its running costs, if powered by a fuel cell, would be low: 40 cents for the motoring equivalent of a gallon of petrol if the rust is reduced locally, or 80 cents if it has to be shipped off to be reduced. Even if the hydrogen is burnt in an internal combustion engine, its cost could be about $1.80 a gallon, compared with the American price of $1.25 for a gallon of petrol today.
Rolls Royce is helping H Power improve the design of the iron-engine and the machine to reduce rust. In addition three oil companies, including Britain's BP, are talking to the company. With this help, H Power thinks it will be able to unveil a prototype vehicle at the start of next year. In the past, electric vehicles have failed on their motoring performance, even if their economic performance is acceptable. Assuming H Power's car avoids this trap, Californian motorists could soon be emptying their tanks at filling stations and filling up as they drive along."

Menjar be i cagar fort
I no tingues por de la more.
Eat well, shit strongly,
And you will have no fear of death.
From folk sayings to famous artists like Salvador Dali, Catalans show an obsession with excrement. On the Feast of Kings, January 6th, children who have been good are given pretty sweetmeats but bad ones get turds of brown marzipan. Even the rivers that bordered Catalonia's capital, Barcelona, in medieval times used to be called the Merdanca (shit stream) and the Cagallel (turd-bearer). This scatological obsession belongs to the earthiness that helps to give Barcelona--""the great enchantress"", as one of its favourite poets, Joan Maragall, calls it--its seductiveness, along with its art, its food and of course the sun.
Visitors to Barcelona for the Olympic Games this summer--and the half of the world's population expected to tune in on televisionwill find a city that is anything but dirty. In preparation, as much as $1 billion has been lavished on Barcelona, and the result is a city cleansed and modernised right down to its sewers. There are new ring roads, property developments, harbours, beaches (Barcelona used to be cut off from the sea by a railway line, but this has been firmly put underground). The place has an infectious optimism, even if not everyone is thrilled by the changes. Manuel Vazquez Montalban, one of Barcelona's best writers, complains that the city is being ""pasteurised"".
Yet to the outsider Barcelona is still a stunner. Partly this is because, thanks to restoration and strict preservation laws, many of its finest old buildings are again looking as they should; the city is an architectural treasure-trove. Partly it is because the place is still buzzing with ideas. It has become a rival to Milan in matters of design (one guidebook rates its bars, discos and restaurants purely by design). Avant-garde art is everywhere, including in politics (where else would a controversial plan for a giant statue of an old sock, by Antoni Tapies, be front-page news?). And, despite all the spending, the low life is still easy to find, even in the city's heart. On Saturday nights in Placa Reial, writes Rober Hughes, ""you can almost hear the viruses mutating.""
Besides, as Mr Hughes points out in a book that should become every traveller's companion to Barcelona, the frenzy of renewal after a long period of urban neglect is in the best tradition of the city. Mr Hughes set out to write about the modernista art movement that flourished in the wake of the last great refit of Barcelona, more than a century ago. He ended up going right back to Barcelona's beginnings, for the modernists, he found, could be properly understood only in the context of the Catalan past.
The result is a sweeping history of a city that is really three cities. Its inner core is the higgledy-piggledy Gothic Quarter. Then comes the repetitive regularity of the 19th-century Eixample (Enlargement), a vast grid of avenues and squares with chamfered corners. The outer layer consists of the less interesting industrial suburbs that sprouted after 1945 under the Franco dictatorship.
The Gothic quarter contains what Mr Hughes describes as Europe's most complete array of buildings from the 13th to the 15th centuries. Its history also explains a lot of the preoccupations of Barcelona today: the quest to project itself to the world, the promotion of industry and commerce, the rivalry with Madrid. Today, the Catalan government boasts that it has recently expanded the number of trade-promotion offices abroad from three to 28; before the end of the 13th century, as the empire of the count-kings of Aragon and Catalonia grew, there were consulates in no fewer than 126 places around the Mediterranean.
When the 19th-century textile industry's growth pulled Barcelona out of its medieval walls, it produced a stunning experiment in urban planning. The Eixample invites comparison with Baron Haussmann's remodelling of Paris. But there is a big difference. In Paris, swathes of the old city were in the way and had to be destroyed to make way for Haussmann's plans. In Barcelona, the planner, Ildefons Cerda, could start from scratch. His grid plan was put down on paper in 1859 and mostly filled in by 1910.
Cerda was a socialist. He had a rare chance to design a city corresponding to his egalitarian theories. Hence his grid: each block was construed as representing a social cross-section, with no hierarchy, no good or bad end of town. Reality, of course, turned out to be rather different. Parts of the Eixample soon became more expensive than others. The property developers saw to it that the green spaces in Cerda's plans were filled in. Yet the basic structure--critics would say the fundamental monotony--of the Cerda scheme remains.
In fact, the Eixample is saved from monotony by its brilliant architects. Among these Antoni Gaudi stands out as the greatest. And among Gaudi's works the unfinished church of the Sagrada Familia has become the emblem of Barcelona.
The plans for the church were destroyed in June 1936, during Spain's civil war, when anarchists burst into the workshops. With money from Japan (the Japanese, writes Mr Hughes caustically, are nuts about Gaudisan), the Sagrada Familia is now being ""finished"", amid much controversy. The controversy ensures that Gaudi's church continues to epitomise Barcelona: its divisions, its fanaticisms, its immense ambitions, its way since Gothic times--as Mr Hughes puts it--""of making leaps of civic and architectural faith against all the odds, and winning.""
What are the cultural roots that Mr Hughes felt he had to explore to understand the modernists? There is the struggle to protect Catalan identity, in language, traditions and institutions; this explains the nostalgia expressed by Catalan poets, and in Joan Miro's painting ""The Farm, Montroig"". This inward-lookingness contrasts with another Catalan characteristic, preeminent in the modernist period: openness to Europe. The clash seems to produce a creative tension, much like that between the twin Catalan qualities of seny (common sense) and rauxa (ucontrollable emotion, often expressed in violence or vulgarity, as in the cult of excrement).
Barcelona fluctuates between periods of seny and relieving outbursts of rauxa. It is having a spell of seny. If history is a guide, an explosion of rauxa will surely follow."

During the 1964 presidential campaign, when Lyndon Johnson kept saying, ""We don't want our American boys to do the fighting for Asian boys,"" was this campaign blarney, and was he secretly planning a wider, Americanised war in Vietnam? The State Department's Office of the Historian has just published a 1,100-page volume of 1964 documents on the Vietnam conflict* based on the long-closed files of the president, the Departments of State and Defence, the National Security Council and the CIA. They confirm, as the world has begun to learn from other sources, that LBJ was a most reluctant interventionist indeed.
When 1964 opened, Johnson had been in the White House less than six weeks and the struggle in Vietnam was going from bad to worse. Believing that John Kennedy had made a solemn commitment to South Vietnam, which should be kept, LBJ did not know how to ""win the war"", but wished to make sure the United States did not lose it. What to do? For one thing, he consulted the most powerful and (supposedly) best-informed people he could find.
In early June 1964 he sent to Paris his ""resident dove"", the under-secretary of state, George Ball, to meet President Charles de Gaulle, who condescended to propose an unmanageably large international conference. ""He doubted that even Ho Chi Minh could continue to kill South Vietnamese while taking part in a conference. World opinion would make it impossible."" At the White House LBJ himself met, among others, Walter Lippmann. That influential journalist, when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, had counselled against American intervention. Now Lippmann gave it as his opinion ""that (a) all of South-East Asia was destined inevitably to become a zone of Chinese Communist control; (b) that we could not halt Chinese expansionism in this area; and (c) that our best hope was to seek by political means to slow that expansionism down and make it less brutal.""
Unpersuaded, the president decided to persist. His goal remained a civilian government in Saigon, at once stable, effective and reasonably democratic or responsive to its people's wishes. Throughout 1964, no such government was in sight. The communists increased their military attacks.
On August 2nd and 4th the American destroyers Maddox and C. Turner Joy were reported to have been attacked while on patrol off the North Vietnamese coast. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the newly published documents make it clear that LBJ was not waiting to pounce on the so-called Gulf of Tonkin incident--and the empowering resolution he quickly obtained from Congress--to start an undeclared war against North Vietnam. As the secretary of state, Den Rusk, told the American representative at the United Nations on the telephone on the evening of August 4th: ""In no sense is this destroyer a pretext to make a big thing out of a little thing.
Abroad, LBJ remained cautious and circumspect--far more so than he was at home. When a second series of attacks on American warships reportedly took place on September 18th, he once more showed a deep-seated scepticism. As McGeorge Bundy, his national security adviser, recorded in a memorandum dated September 20th, ""The president continued to make clear his very grave doubt that there had been any hostile vessels, let alone an intention to attack...""
Behind the scenes, the administration continued to encourage a negotiated settlement. In mid-August Rusk instructed J. Blair Seaborn, a Canadian member of the International Supervision and Control Commission for Vietnam, as he set out for talks in Hanoi: ""Mr Seaborn can again refer to the many examples of US policy in tolerance of peaceful coexistence with Communist regimes, such as Yugoslavia, Poland, etc. He can hint at the economic and other benefits which have accrued to those countries because their policy of Communism has confined itself to the development of their own national territories and has not sought to expand into other areas."" Nothing, however, came of the Seaborn mission.
In the latter months of 1964, as the military situation in Vietnam grew steadily more perilous, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and some of Johnson's top civilian aides--holdovers from the Kennedy administration--began to press for a more vigorous military policy. In a memorandum to Johnson on August 31st, McGeorge Bundy wrote: ""A still more drastic possibility which no one is discussing is the use of substantial US armed forces in operations against the Viet Cong. I myself believe that before we let this country go we should have a hard look at this grim alternative, and I do not at all think that it is a repetition of Korea.""
About such proposals, it is now abundantly clear, LBJ had the most serious reservations. He also continued to reject the massive use of American air power. He remained unimpressed by political and journalistic calls for ""our necessity of being [a] power in the Pacific"". As he burst out at a White House meeting on December 1st 1964, ""Are they drunk on Alsop?""
The president was starkly aware of the price of failure. It would hurt the Democrats as badly as the ""loss of China"" had hurt them in the 1940s and 1950s. But for Johnson the dangers of escalating into the unknown were still predominant. And by early December he knew he could count on little or no assistance from Britain and other NATO allies.
About one thing LBJ had no doubt. It was now his war. As he put it in a personal cable to General Maxwell D. Taylor, then American ambassador in Saigon, on December 30th: ""In this tough situation...the final responsibility is mine and the stakes are very high indeed.""
This volume, vastly informative as it is, is not the last word on the subject. It may be years before the corresponding communist documents appear in Hanoi, Moscow and Peking, and the meaning of the Vietnam war can at last be fully understood.

Imagine that you gate-crash a party only to discover that it is the annual booze-up of the Constitutional Reform Society. The first person you meet--a professor of politics, to judge by his corduroy jacket--prattles on about something called the STV. Then a woman takes you to one side and whispers that she is leading an underground struggle against the Conservative one-party state: would you care to subscribe to one of her samizdat publications? You head for the door only to be trapped by a bearded man who rambles on about the fate of third parties in first-past-the-post elections.
The problem with the constitutional debate in Britain is that it is too often a dialogue between the dull and the defeated. Politicians take to constitution-mongering when they fail to win elections. Academics turn to it when they discover that they are not up to being philosophers or historians. And the Conservative Party is not unnaturally happy to gloat over a system that seems destined to keep it in power for the rest of the century.
Ferdinand Mount is an exception to such rules. Not only is he an elegant writer and a competent scholar. He is also a Conservative--he once ran the Downing Street Policy Unit under Margaret Thatcher--but one of unusually reflective disposition. He is rightly convinced that the Tories now need to think as hard about the constitution as they once did about the economy. The alternative is to lose the moral and intellectual initiative to the opposition at home and the Eurocrats abroad.
Mr Mount says constitutional thought has been bedevilled by the assumption of the omnipotence of the House of Commons. This assumption has united thinkers as diverse as Walter Bagehot and Sir Ivor Jennings and politicians as different as Mrs Thatcher and Tony Benn.
To Mr Mount, this approach is both misleading and pernicious. Misleading because the British constitution has long been much more a matter of checks and balances than the omnipotent Commons school would have you believe. Pernicious because it can persuade hyperactive prime ministers to abuse their powers and produce lousy legislation. Remember the poll tax?
He therefore thinks Britain needs a more mixed and qualified notion of sovereignty, if it is not to see its institutions degenerate. The demands of Brussels and Glasgow are already pushing Britain in a pluralist direction. Members of Parliament at Westminster should regard such changes as an opportunity to be exploited rather than as a threat to be resisted.
For this pluralist vision to have substance, argues Mr Mount, three big changes are necessary: fixed-term parliaments of, say, four years; a Bill of Rights; and a supreme court charged with interpreting and safeguarding the Bill of Rights. Fixed-term parliaments will make parliamentary life a lot more stable and a little less seedy (and also, as Mr Mount admits, a lot less interesting). A division of powers between parliament and the courts will curb the pretensions of the executive and ensure a more even distribution of civil duties throughout society. By limiting the power of government, Britain will begin to eradicate the debilitating belief that the government can solve every problem.
It may seem surprising that someone once close to Mrs Thatcher should feel this way about parliamentary power. To rebut the charge that he is a sandalled liberal, Mr Mount maintains that it is the battering-ram view of political activity, invented by Bagehot and perfected by Mrs Thatcher, which is alien to British habits. His book is an attempt to revive an older political tradition, which flourished in the 17th and early 18th centuries. A flexible party, the Tories."

I know you have been having a nightmare about a new war in the Pacific, but it really is all right; I think. To be sure, we are all worried about what comes after the tidy cold-war world, but your fear that the United States might have to drop a nuclear weapon on Tokyo bay in November 1999 in order to stop Japan seizing bits of China is, on the face of it, preposterous. What happened to the Simon Winchester who wrote ""The Pacific"" (Hutchinson, 1991), a book about the promise of peace and prosperity in the region? Surely you remember that wonderfully intricate network of economic and political interests that is binding the peoples of East Asia into an interdependent world?
Of course, as with all nightmares, there is a real anxiety at the back of your new book*. As someone who has long lived in Hong Kong, you naturally fear that the transition to Chinese rule in 1997 may go badly wrong. But it hardly seems likely that China would appoint a tough from northern China as the first post-British governor of the place, or that British troops would have to kill over 100 people at Happy Valley racecourse in the dying days of their rule.
Now we know that even the Soviet Union can disintegrate, it is far less fanciful to think that the convergence of Hong Kong and China might help to break up the Chinese empire. Think of all those reassuring statistics in the early 1990s about growing economic integration between Hong Kong and China. As southern China becomes more closely tied to Hong Kong and Taiwan, it is rapidly developing into something very different from northern China and the borderlands with central Asia.
And meanwhile investment from Japan (and from South Korea) is also changing the flavour of northern China. Japanese investment there might conceivably be a reason for Japanese nationalists to argue for military action to defend Japan's economic interests. But to think all this might lead to global conflict assumes that the government of China would not be able to prevent these regional differences getting out of hand.
Could that be? Well, it is true that few of the troops who carried out the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989 were from south China, and that after decades of reform in the south the army there might be more reluctant to follow orders from unreconstructed communists in the north. It is admittedly not so long ago that China was divided by warlords, and then by a civil war between nationalists and communists. And in Asia, unlike Europe, there is no international security network by which the neighbours might hope to control a fast-breaking crisis. It is, on second thoughts, curious how East Asia's 1990s begin to look a little like its 1930s, with a rising Japan, a possibly fragmenting China, and no outsider in much of a position to control things.
Maybe your nightmare is not so implausible after all. I see there was a meeting at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London on April 30th--about the risks of disintegration in China. A pity you couldn't come. It's a subject everybody ought to be thinking about.

His good lady had robustly survived two poisonings and a bomb, and she was placidly accustomed to his habit of nudging her towards cliff edges at Beachy Head and other coastal resorts. In a Scottish town, a more resourceful husband, on being threatened by a robber while waiting at a bus stop with his wife, detached her artificial leg and hit the thug on the head with it--incidentally, but accidentally, killing him.
John Mortimer, barrister and creator of ""Rumpole of the Bailey"", cited many such real-life oddities during the Folio Society's annual debate, in London on May 8th. He set a couple of hundred bookworms laughing as he opposed--and fought to a draw--a motion that ""these days, crime fiction is more interesting than the real thing.""
He was, of course, sieving out the few available specks of entertaining glitter from the great heap of dreariness that most real-life crime represents. The proposer of the motion was less ruthlessly selective, and less given to rumbustious rumpoling, although she, too, got plenty of laughs. She was Baroness James, who nowadays has a peerage as well as a first name, Phyllis, veiled behind the discreet initials P.D.
In the debate P.D. James stressed the words ""these days"", making it clear that she meant no insult to earlier crime writers, but failing to explain what she really did mean. Real-life crime may have multiplied (according to the available statistics), but has it thereby become even duller? Does she believe that it once had a genuinely ""interesting"" golden age?
Surely not. Crime fiction, on the other hand, is often credited with a ""golden age"" in the inter-war period, 1918-39. Conan Doyle, Ernest Bramah and G.K. Chesterton produced their last works in those years, and the torch passed to--among others--Allingham, Christie, Hammett, Ngaio Marsh, Ellery Queen, Sayers, Simenon, Rex Stout, Josephine Tey and S.S. Van Dine.
Since then, much has changed. In recent years many publishers have tended to insist on the explicit descriptions of sexual couplings that were taboo in the age of the asterisk. Violence may not really be all that new: Sherlock Holmes was launched on floods of gore in ""A Study in Scarlet"" 105 years ago, and he went on to find ""Black Peter"" transfixed by a steel harpoon and ""The Cardboard Box"" full of human ears; but some modern writers seem to strain for violence in a rather constipated way. And tricks first performed in the golden age (such as Christie's last-page revelation that the murderer of Roger Ackroyd was the narrator) can never be repeated with similar impact.
Even in that age, however, not all that glistered was true gold. Much inter-war crime fiction has survived to win new readers; but some works that then had great success are now stone dead, including those rather pernickety stories in which everything depended on train tickets and timetables. Time; like a patient sub-editor, has cut away the dross.
Good old market forces are even now working away on the current output of crime fiction. Only the best of it will stand any chance of living on to match the longevity of, say, the Conan Doyle and Chesterton classics. That is why, given time, it is sure to become ""more interesting than the real thing"". How much better life would be if the quantity and quality of real crime were determined by its power to attract and hold the book-buying and television-watching public. Unfortunately, different sets of market forces apply there."

Not so, quite rightly, the resuscitated D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which, after a thin financial time in the 1980s, is again taking Gilbert and Sullivan classics on tour around Britain. In its longest road-show so far, the new company will be performing ""The Mikado"" and ""The Yeomen of the Guard"" all over the country until November, raising its hat to Sir Arthur as it does so.
The composer would have mixed feelings about this. The man who wrote the operas' words, W.S. Gilbert, was a crusty, no-nonsense professional. Sullivan always felt uneasy that his talents were so publicly associated with mere comic opera. Most of their joint successes inspired a declaration from Sullivan that he would have no more to do with ""that class of piece"". Henceforth he would concentrate on the works expected of Queen Victoria's favourite composer and the leading musician of his time, the man singled out by the cultural establishment to raise English music from its lamentably fallen state.
Sullivan did his best, turning out a properly grand cantata, ""The Golden Lend"", and his only serious opera, ""Ivanhoe"". But he also continued to toil away with Gilbert, however much he protested at ""this slavery"", because it gave him an opulent life. And it is as well that he did, since none of his weightier works has lasted, despite the efforts of Sullivan-specialists to present them as neglected masterpieces.
Even in his own time, one discerning fellow frankly told Sullivan that his best work was not ""The Golden Legend"" but ""The Mikado"". Of ""Ivanhoe"" all that remains is London's Palace theatre, which Richard D'Oyly Carte, founder of the dynasty, built in 1891 as a home for the future English operas Sullivan's magnum opus would inspire. This edifice now holds nightly performances of ""Les Miserables"".
The new D'Oyly Carte productions corroborate the verdict of history. The real Sullivan is the musical half of G&S--maybe the better half, the man mainly responsible for the operas' continuing popularity. Today's producers find Gilbert hard to deal with. Despite their satiric sharpness, his libretti are marred by unrelenting facetiousness, mechanical absurdity and a general tone that often recalls back numbers of Punch. Gilbert's characters tend to be pantomime types, but Sullivan's music endows them with freshness and vivacity. Where Gilbert is almost cynically sentimental, Sullivan is genuinely romantic, investing cardboard lovers with lyric emotion. Modern productions struggle with Gilbert's stilted dialogue, but relish Sullivan's graceful scores.
Yet one should be wary of too easily pronouncing Sullivan the major partner, of saying that without Sullivan there would be no Gilbert. The truth is that the composer's gifts could blossom only in the settings Gilbert provided, and the discipline he required. When Sullivan was in charge, as in the works he considered his serious bids for immortality, he sounds merely pompous, lacking the power of extended invention and development that large structures demand. His talent is genuine, but small-scale, ideal for the charming melodies, infectious rhythms and felicitous bits of orchestration in which the operas abound.
And that abundance is the direct result of Gilbert's efforts. If, in a sense, Sullivan was the purer artist, Gilbert was the truer professional. If the literary tone of the libretti occasionally makes a modern audience squirm, their effectiveness on stage is indisputable. As a writer, Gilbert may have been patchy, but as a man of the theatre he was a master--the father, in fact, of modern stage direction. Much of the charm of the G&S operas lies in their unerring pace, variety and sequence of action. These were due to Gilbert alone. His fluid arrangement of characters and situations created the setting for Sullivan's happy musical inspirations, and together they generate the blithe appeal of G&S.
No Gilbert without Sullivan? Very likely, but no Sullivan without Gilbert either. In commemorating the composer's birth, it would be well to tip the hat also to his hard-nosed colleague, who made his enduring reputation possible."

The subject under debate? Poetry for the Next Millennium. Where it was going. What it was for. What it might be like if the world survived that long.
Unfortunately, the famous poets on the panel on May 6th did not seem to know why they had come. ""Does anyone know what we're supposed to be doing here?"" asked Margaret Atwood, a Canadian poet and novelist. The others shook their heads and looked miserable. ""They asked me to prepare a 15-minute talk. Now it looks like it's going to be an informal discussion...I know the British are famed for their plots, not saying what they really mean.""
No one seemed sure, least of all Tom Paulin, a Belfast poet and critic, who was in the chair. He had started out by telling the audience, ""It's the first time I've ever chaired anything, so I hope you'll forgive me if I flannel around this evening."" A Polish poet and translator, Adam Czerniawski, visibly disliked discovering that he would not have to read the piece he had prepared.
But worst of all was the subject itself, which everybody hated. ""This evening's motion is undiscussable,"" said Mr Czerniawski (when at last coaxed into speech) about the idea of a millennium's-worth of poetry: ""Creativity is so unpredictable. No one can predict the workings of the Muse.""
Ms Atwood did not like that. It reminded her of what Robert Graves had once said about men doing and women being. As a feminist, she thought it deplorable. Unfortunately, she then told the audience that she had carried out two surveys which seemed to prove that writers believed in the female Muse. And not just creative writers, historians too. But she still was not convinced. ""You may as well believe in ghosts,"" she said. Mr Czerniawski apologised, a bit half-heartedly. ""All I mean,"" he said, ""is that writing seems to come and go as it pleases. What you're saying takes us too far into the paranormal...""
The only writer to emerge with any dignity from the mess was a Czech poet, Miroslav Holub--perhaps because his limited command of English did not enable him to catch all of what was being said. He talked of the challenge faced by poets in the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe. The old certitudes of the dissident writer, during 40 years of oppression, had suddenly gone, and the human animal was at last free to become what he had been intended to be from the beginning. ""It's like opening cages in a zoo,"" he said. ""You expect beautiful people to get out of the cages, showing us the best of their hearts and their souls. But what slip out are the ferrets and the tigers and the panthers. And the poor intellectuals just stand there and stare.""
The species on the platform gaped. Tom Paulin mentioned that there was a bar outside if, by any chance, one wished to continue the discussion elsewhere."

Instead of bringing the hoped-for new togetherness, the end of the cold war and the collapse of communism are rapidly turning Europe into the world's most unstable continent. Russia has emerged from the debris of the Soviet Union still with the biggest army in Europe and now at odds with its new neighbours. From Czecho-Slovakia to Checheno-Ingushetia, new splinter-states are in the making. From Bosnia & Hercegovina to Nagorno-Karabakh, people are doing to each other the sorts of barbarous things that Europeans thought happened only on other, less civilised continents. Europe's legacy of national hatreds has already caused two world wars this century. Now the place seems to be blowing apart again.
This was not supposed to happen. In Africa, Asia and the Middle East, the end of East-West rivalry helped finish wars, not start them. Unlike those places, Europe is stuffed with organisations, from NATO and the European Community to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, ready to take the strain of change from the old order to the new. So why is so much going wrong in Europe, and why has no one fixed it?
One problem is that the well-rehearsed ways of defending Europe's security--putting infantry and tanks on the front line of freedom--no longer make sense. The front line and the huge Soviet military threat on the far side of it have gone. The boom and crump now echoing about Europe's east are distressing, the consequences for people caught up in the mayhem devastating, but the shrapnel no longer flies very far. Despite the fighting, nobody is arguing that America should halt the planned withdrawal of more than half of its troops from Europe or that Britain, France and Germany should reverse the cuts in their soldiery. On the contrary, on both sides of the Atlantic NATO's military indolence in Europe's new time of trouble raises again the question of whether West Europeans and Americans still need their old defence alliance. Europeans are rich; they are working towards economic and political union. Surely it is time they managed their own defence?
BIGGER THAN THE BOTH OF US
For those mesmerised by NATO's one obvious triumph--its success in defending the West against the Soviet menace--its job is over. The Canadians have already packed their bags and are pulling out. The Americans, this argument goes, are merely pulling out in less haste, in stages. But eventually, and probably sooner rather than later, they will be one. America's assumed long goodbye is France's new argument for keeping its troops clear of NATO command and (with no apologies to its old claim, that America was too dominant in Europe's defence). France also sees fit to be pressing ahead with a Franco-German corps as the embryo of a European army (see page 51). Given all these changes, what point is there in looking for other ways--like NATO's new Co-operation Council with the countries of Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union--to provide dying institutions with life support? .
If NATO is really just dying slowly, then Western Europe ought to be building itself a home-grown replacement, and quickly. But NATO has many reasons to stay alive and alert. Its military commands are the defence arms of a western alliance that has long gone wider than the old front line in Europe. As the Gulfwar showed, and as other still-unknown challenges to their common security interests will show, Americans and West Europeans have good reason to go on planning their defences and rehearsing their manoeuvres together. The communist threat is gone, but the world is no more certain. It is not even clear that the new Russia will remain the friendly neighbour it now is. Its size, and the pulls of its eastern and western interests, could make an economically successful Russia as awkward to live with as a failed Russia. Either would have nuclear weapons.
Indeed there are few imaginable threats to their future security that Europeans could meet anywhere near so effectively (and cost-effectively) without America's military help and logistical support. That does not stop Europeans organising more things together. On the contrary, a bigger contribution from Europe to its own defence will be part of what persuades Americans that it is worth holding up their end of the alliance. The line comes where European defence co-operation no longer complements NATO, but starts to compete with it--precisely the worry about the new Franco-German force.
NATO is more than just the sum of its military parts. America's commitment to Europe's freedom has been the foundation on which European prosperity and integration have been built. It was not just that America's presence prevented any prospect that Europe could again be dominated by a menacing power, a prospect almost as worrying to America as to Europe; it was also that American troops gave West Europeans the security they needed to settle their old rivalries and build anew.
Nor is Western Europe's need for this wider club diminished by the European Community's plans for closer integration. The path to that integration may be far from smooth. Either way, in trade and finance, as much as in military and security matters, the broader European-American relationship is vital to Europe's future. Artificially driving Europe and America apart as a way of giving clearer definition to European union risks reducing the transatlantic dialogue to salvoes of harsh words on trade. For both, the change could be a military, political and economic disaster.
But if the NATO connection still does so much to preserve Western Europe's peace and prosperity, why can't NATO tackle Eastern Europe's new rivalries and instability by extending itself eastwards? Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia make no bones of their desire for NATO protection. Russia has offered to join. Before ticking off what NATO should be up to in Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union, consider first why NATO has worked so well for the West.
HELPING THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES
NATO is an alliance for the collective defence of its members. It does not have the woollier purpose of collective security for all. Its members promise to come to each other's assistance in the event of attack. For such a promise to be given, believed and kept, there needs to be a high degree of mutual confidence and a shared assessment of threat (witness the debilitating debate in Germany over whether it should go to the defence of Turkey during the Gulf war). Some day NATO may be ready to welcome Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia as members. The rest look harder to absorb. Importing the problems of Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union into NATO would render it less capable of doing its military job in a crisis.
But, though membership may be ruled out for now, there are things that NATO can do to help. One would be to use NATO's well-drilled soldiers and up-to-date equipment whether under a United Nations flag or some other, to help keep the peace in places where diplomats can first make one. There may even be places--for example, Serbia's aggression against Bosnia--where limited applications of western force (a gunboat off the coast or threats designed to keep an aggressive air force grounded) could help bring combatants more quickly to the peace table. Such actions would be rare. It is not for NATO to take upon itself the role of military gendarme.
Beyond that NATO should try to find ways to transfer to the newly free states of the East the successful security ways of the West. They need to know how to put their military men and planning under effective civilian control, how to organise their armies so that they can do their defending without posing a threat to the neighbours. The new Co-operation Council can help with all this and more. NATO can also help in extending the confidence and security-building measures--exchanges military visits and information, notification of troop movements--that helped defuse the East-West confrontation and could now help with East-East tensions.
All that said, no amount of peace-keeping or good offices can prevent people bent on slaughtering each other from doing so. The sort of help NATO can offer will work best where countries--and combatants--are ready to talk rather than fight. Help is there for those willing to help themselves."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224147471/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/2?accountid=14657,"It all appeared to be going so well. At last, it seemed, the world was coming to see that the secret of prosperity and stability lay in democracy, and the only Asians foolish enough to resist this simple proposition were aged communists in places like China or reactionary generals in countries like Myanmar. Not so. The slaughter in the streets of Bangkok this week is a sad reminder that the democratic idea may well be less powerful than the old combination of autocracy and greed, at least for a while. Thais must now learn the hard way that prosperity suffers if democracy is denied.
Thailand has not seen this kind of repression since 1976, when hundreds of students were shot dead in one of Bangkok's universities. Since then Thailand has transformed itself from a wobbly domino, apparently on the point of succumbing to Indochinese communism, into the world's fastest growing economy. The architects of this transformation were the capital's increasingly powerful middle class. They believed the generals, who have ruled Thailand for all but 12 of the past 60 years, were bright enough to realise that modern Thailand has become too complex to be run by uniformed strongmen.
Bangkok's middle class has paid a heavy price for over-estimating the generals' intelligence. The brutal assault by the army on peaceful demonstrators on the nights of May 17th and 18th has proved that Thailand's generals will stop at nothing to maintain their grip on power. But in throttling the democrats' hopes, they may find they have also throttled all Thais' hopes--including their own--of a dynamic economy. If so, this week's events will hold a lesson not just for Thailand, but for other countries such as Indonesia where flourishing economies are burdened with over-soldiered governments.
Thailand's generals may well consider democracy unimportant; it has not, after all, been much in evidence as an ingredient of the economy's recent success, even though the most dramatic growth has occurred during the past five, relatively democratic years. The foundations for this growth were laid by decades of cautious fiscal management, which kept government small, and by South-East Asia's only successful attempt to integrate the ethnic Chinese, who dominate business throughout the region. But the fuel was provided by foreign investors, led by the Japanese. By the end of 1990, Japanese-owned factories were opening at the rate of one every 2-1/2 days. The generals' biggest worry must now be that foreigners will take fright.
Until this week foreigners usually thought Thailand to be reasonably sound. Stability was based on the trinity of the monarchy, Buddhism and the technocrats who manage the economy. Pay-offs to a frequently changing cast of generals and their civilian stooges were an unpleasant cost of doing business, but one that was more than offset by the profits to be made in an economy growing at 10% a year. And Thailand, ""the land of smiles"", was a friendly place to do business.
The army's actions have shredded this image, and with poor timing. Even before this month's shootings, the economy was slowing. The riots may puncture Bangkok's property bubble. More serious will be the effect on tourism, which is still Thailand's biggest earner of foreign exchange. A cut in tourist revenues will make it harder to finance the current account deficit, which is expected to reach $9.7 billion this year (9.1% of GDP). A week ago Thailand could have financed this deficit easily: its total foreign debt is modest. Nothing, however, makes bankers more nervous than corpses in the street.
NAUGHT FOR THEIR COMFORT
Optimists will argue that shooting a few students every now and again did nothing to hinder the growth of South Korea. True, but Thailand has opened up its economy to foreign trade and investment at a much earlier stage in its development than Korea did. This has allowed the Thais to enjoy a boom in investment and consumption at the same time, whereas the Koreans austerely chose not to shop until they were rich. Another difference is that Korean generals have usually been clever enough to act on sound economic advice. The men now in charge of Bangkok are likely to embark on a damaging programme of populist measures in a doomed attempt to win back friends.
The good news is that Thailand's relative openness to the world makes it possible for the world to help its aspiring democrats. That means proffering a cold shoulder to their enemies, the generals. These men have been treated too indulgently for too long. The Thai army has little to be proud of: feeble in war--it was seen off even by tiny Laos in a skirmish in 1988--it has become better known for its slaughter of refugees from Cambodia, its rape of the region's forests and its involvement in the heroin trade.
The main concern of Thai generals is to line their pockets. Logs and drugs may keep them happy for a while. But in time they may come to see that, if Thailand is not to retreat ever further into the past, it needs to do honest business with honest foreigners. Foreigners, meanwhile, may judge it prudent as well as moral to explain that loans, tourism and investment will not come to a country whose government shoots its own citizens. The sad part is that the brave middle-class demonstrators who have already suffered on the streets this week will have to suffer again. They, however, unlike the generals, do know that Thailand can have no prosperity and stability without democracy."

When stockmarkets crash, accusing fingers point to computerised trading, though the computers' biggest sin is merely to carry information fast. When economies crumple, firms carp at fancy money-raising instruments. They protest that syndicated loans and commercial paper leave them at the mercy of cudgel-faced investors, who demand prompt payment no matter how deep the recession. They pine for the days of ""relationship banking"", when lenders were willing to nurse firms through hard times.
Cash-strapped companies are not the only advocates of old-time corporate finance. Economists have argued for years that close links between banks and their borrowers, extending even to a say in company management, are a principal reason why the German and Japanese economies have done so well. That sort of partnership, it is said, unlike the less intimate connections that have become customary in ""Anglo-Saxon"" finance, guards against short-termism: finance and management can join together in planning growth over a span of many years.
FROM DOCKLANDS TO MARUNOUCHI
This debate deserves a sharper edge. The mess at Olympia & York, the world's biggest and most indebted private landlord, suggests that market-based lending works better than relationship banking--though many, in the blame-a-gadget tradition, appear to be drawing the opposite conclusion. The far bigger mess in Japanese banking points the same way. Indeed, wherever bankers are in trouble, a question needs to be asked anew: what are banks actually for?
Olympia & York, like most big international companies, turned to bonds for a good reason: they were (and are) cheaper than traditional bank loans. Because they come in small, tradable packages, bonds are more attractive to investors than lumpy, illiquid loans. Investors happily pay more for them, so firms get finance for less. Also, keeping tabs on bonds does not require offices full of bank clerks: this too reduces cost. Bonds are gaining ground in Japan and Germany, the supposed strongholds of the banks. Japanese firms, concerned at their rising cost of capital, are so keen to raise money cheaply that they put the job of selling their securities out to tender, rather than passing it to their main banks.
Yet many people see the saga of Olympia & York as adding to the allure of traditional banking--because, at least until now, old-style lenders have been more generous to the company than its high-tech investors. The company's troubles came to light in March when Canadian investors refused to accept new short-term securities as the existing ones matured. Then, on May 14th, the company was compelled to take shelter from the bankruptcy courts after J.P. Morgan began proceedings to seize the collateral on a syndicated loan, and after various groups of bond-holders had threatened to do the same. Meanwhile, and in contrast, the banks that have lent to Canary Wharf in London have been willing--so far, at least--to stump up new money (at a rate of around $1.8m a day) to keep the project going.
The moral seems clear: clever finance, which raises money from a large and dispersed group of investors with no commitment to firm or project, leads companies into difficulty. This is wrong. Olympia & York is not in trouble because investors pulled the plug, still less because it kept its cost of borrowing down. It is in trouble because it misjudged its market and borrowed too much. Once those mistakes had been made, what mattered was to expose them promptly so that they could be remedied. Olympia & York suggests that securities markets can spot such mistakes faster than banks. When investors turned sceptical, most bankers were still hoping the company's assurances of good health were true.
As Japan is discovering, not admitting to trouble early stores up double-trouble for the future. All too easily, good money is thrown after bad. In April the Ministry of Finance announced that Japanese banks had Y8 trillion ($57 billion) of bad domestic debts on their books; now a report leaked from the Bank of Japan puts doubtful debt at up to Y56 trillion. Bankers themselves can only guess at the scale of the problem. In many cases, banks have made loans to other institutions which have on-lent to affiliates, and so on. The riskiness of such loans is anybody's guess. Under pressure, Japan's vaunted approach to banking--which relies on the bank's special knowledge of its borrowers--has simply broken down.
Many of Japan's banking difficulties, admittedly, have little to do with the model of banking that the country has adopted. Much of the blame lies with bad supervision. The country lacks a well-staffed bank inspectorate, such as America's, to scrutinise loan portfolios; and its financial system is more vulnerable than it need be, because regulators have neither obliged nor encouraged banks to make reserves against bad loans. But the system's problems demonstrate a bigger point: they show that relationship banking can be a con. Banks, often unacquainted with their ultimate borrowers, are not managing risk so much as blindly bearing it.
That can put whole economies at risk. The deposits that stand behind bank loans are potentially highly unstable. Because they are repayable in full on demand, doubts about the soundness of a bank may lead depositors to withdraw their cash, causing the bank to fail, with widening economic consequences. Compare that with the riskiness of a bond, which is continuously priced in financial markets: bad news about the borrower causes the price to drop, so the lenders' incentive to jump ship is immediately reduced.
Deposit-banking poses unique economic risks. Banks claim that, in return, they provide a uniquely valuable form of financial intermediation. But this claim rests largely on the view that loan officers know more about borrowers than do distant and disinterested holders of securities. The drama of Olympia & York and the awful spectacle of Japanese banking cast grave doubt on that. If banks, as traditionally conceived, measure risk more expensively and less accurately than markets, it may soon be time to ask: who needs them?"
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144191/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/4?accountid=14657,"For Christopher Isherwood, California was ""a tragic place, like Palestine, like every promised land."" Until recently that opinion seemed catty, or baffling, or both. For most of this century, no other place has offered such a pleasant, tolerant and diverse way of life, such glittering chances to make money, and such sun-filled propaganda for itself.
The slick salesmanship has now backfired. Even before the Los Angeles riots, California had already begun to seem a narrower and uglier place. Recession has hurt. Businesses have been leaving. The state, in debt, has succumbed to nostalgia for the past and pessimism about its future. As the presidential primary approaches on June 2nd, California, with the biggest bundle of delegates to offer either candidate, is coming under intense media scrutiny; but Californians, knowing that both George Bush and Bill Clinton have their nominations sewn up already, are taking the primary as further proof of their state's failing voice.
California protests too much; rich places usually do. Yet its mood matters enormously to America. With 30m people, it is the biggest manufacturing and trading centre of the world's biggest economy. More than that, it is also America's laboratory of the future. With horrified fascination, Texans and New Yorkers look to California and see technologies and cultures to come. They also see disquieting social omens--suburban creep, ethnically explosive cities, jammed roads, pervasive contempt for politicians--and wonder whether they, too, will one day be in the bind that California appears to be in.
The golden state achieved its wealth on the basis of ideals widely presumed to be all-American, but which have reached their finest flowering between San Diego and the Oregon line: open markets, open frontiers, tolerance of new ideas. All these are now in question. The state has lost nearly 600,000 jobs in the past two years. Its defence industry, for which it has long been famous, is being savaged by the end of the cold war. The state government's budget deficit now stands at $3 billion(see page 27), and must be balanced at a time when tax revenues are sluggish. The open market is closing. Earlier this year Los Angeles withdrew from a Japanese company the contract for building its subway trains--in order to save 70 American jobs.
Convinced of its economic fragility, California also feels newly threatened by immigration. Nearly 60% of the babies born in the state this year will be black, Asian or Hispanic. Los Angeles is now only half white, and 90 languages are spoken in its school district. In the legislature in Sacramento, immigrants are increasingly attacked as welfare scroungers. The riots seemed to show that the different races, far from blending, are divided by chasms of mutual mistrust.
On both these counts, the current pessimism is foolish. California still boasts a greater range of ""sunshine"" industries, from computer software to biotechnology, than any other region in the world. Barely 5% of the jobs lost recently have been lost by firms moving out. The state's position, on the western edge of the Pacific and the northern edge of Latin America, is at the centre of America's fastest growing export markets. Indeed, the fundamental strength of California is the reason that immigrants continue to flood in. Once there, most still find it a good place in which to work and prosper.
GOVERNMENT, NEGLECTED AND NEGLECTFUL
California's weakness is not business or immigration, but government. The state's institutions are old, muddled and inefficient. Bureaucratic sprawl, and a mess of interlocking governments, bedevil the running of cities like Los Angeles. At the best of times, only a third of the state's electorate bothers to vote; those who do are overwhelmingly old, white and affluent. Huge numbers of Californians, for one reason or another, feel they have no part in government.
What is to be done? Any reform should begin with a system that seems the epitome of democracy, California's ballot initiatives. These initiatives, designed to circumvent corrupt or supine government, have been turned into the play thing of special interests. Some, such as the famous tax-revolt initiatives of the late 1970s and early 1980s, set a pattern of burden-shifting that has done much to weaken the state's physical infrastructure. But there is a bigger, more insidious effect: California's referendums have been distorted so much that they obstruct representative government. A state governor coming into office will now find that as much as four-fifths of his budget is already mandated in advance. The qualifying procedure for getting initiatives on to the statute book must be made much stiffer. Only then will they reflect the popular will rather than the organising skills of well-financed lobbies.
Bureaucratic sprawl is less easy to deal with. With so many layers of government, nobody can be sure where responsibility for a particular decision lies. The state badly needs a single environmental authority to simplify its maze of green laws and to encourage pollution trading. The governor needs a cabinet of his choice, so that senior state officials are allies rather than rivals. Los Angeles, and other big cities, could benefit from one-tier government for all local services. Entrepreneurial flair could help, too. Los Angeles has a budget deficit of around $200m; but it also has many assets that are ripe for privatisation, including its airport, its harbour and the Department of Water and Power.
Reorganising California's government would require a popular mandate. One step forward would be to make voting easier, perhaps by sending out polling cards to all taxpayers. That might lead to some abuse, but the system cannot be more corrupt than one where more than half the population's views are not being registered at all. Unless California's growing numbers of Mexicans and Asians are helped to discover the ballot box, they will be tempted to look for simpler ways to make their views known. In a country where gun-ownership is constitutionally sacred, that often means violence.
To Californians, such an overhaul of their political system may seem drastic. They should take comfort in two thoughts. As America's biggest economy, their state has both the resources and the people to push such changes through. And as America's Future World, it has encountered these problems first; rather than crying tragedy, it could set the example of solving them."

That is why the spectacle of three astronauts improvising a rescue for an Intelsat-VI satellite marooned in the wrong orbit has done America's National Aeronautics and Space Administration a power of good. The rescue, the new light shed on the creation of the universe by NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer and the refreshing sight of a new administrator in charge of the agency have come together to make NASA look like a success once more. At last the agency seems to have recovered from the shock of losing the Challenger and its crew. Unfortunately, appearances deceive. The agency is eagerly making old mistakes all over again.
BREAD AND CIRCUSES
The Intelsat rescue is just the sort of stunt that the shuttle programme thrived on before the Challenger disaster. The achievement was impressive, and well-timed: it happened as Americans, preoccupied with race and riots, were in need of some heart-lifting news. (Since 1968, when the first Apollo flights provided respite from assassinations, riots and the war in Vietnam, the stars have shone all the brighter in difficult times.) If space flight were intended as nothing more than a popular entertainment, this most recent shuttle mission would certainly be counted a success. But space is meant to be more than good television.
The plebeians of Rome were not averse to the occasional death at the circus; in fact they were all for it. The American public wants heroes who face danger but always win. That is much easier to guarantee in Hollywood than in space, where the danger is real. This risk, undeniably, is part of the romance of space flight. It is why astronauts stir the imagination more than other civil servants. The near-religious feelings that space flight stirs in some hearts are intimately bound up with the notion that, like death, it is touched by the transcendent. Ronald Reagan caught this ambiguous feeling when, in the aftermath of Challenger's fall, he recited a poem already famous among fliers. Was it in reaching for the stars that the Challenger's crew ""Slipped the surly bonds of Earth...and touched the face of God"", or in dying in the attempt?
To accept that space flight inspires and excites, and that it should, is not to condone every risk--or every cost. According to NASA, the cost of last week's rescue mission was $350m; outsiders, who add in personnel and other costs, argue that the true figure may be twice as much. The mission saved Intelsat, the telecoms organisation that runs most of the world's communication satellites, the cost of replacing the satellite, which would have been around $250m. Intelsat paid NASA $93m for the rescue. Asked to list things worth risking astronauts' lives for, few would put a large subsidy to a near-monopoly supplier of satellite communications near the top. After Challenger, President Reagan ruled that communications satellites were not to be a reason for risking astronauts' lives. He was right.
The difficulty is to find missions that are worth the risk. The space-shuttle programme is uninteresting without novelty: if the astronauts last week had merely practised putting parts of the space station together, as originally planned, nobody would have noticed. Instead of seeking gimmicks to make an intrinsically uninspiring effort seem bold, it would be better to devise a programme that was exciting in itself, in a way that routine shuttle flights and the planned space station can never be. Start with missions to the Russian space station, Mir, to make use of it for orbital experiments. Then return to the moon, not by means of an unwieldy space station but with big new rockets to get there straight from earth. Then to Mars.
This sort of exploration provides an awesome goal to match the feelings that space flight arouses. Even then, space will remain an odd frontier to explore. Whereas America's West, the archetype of such frontiers, was beyond the reach of government, manned space flight is government's very creature, unable to breathe for a second without taxpayers' money. In the old West, people did what they wanted to; that was why they were there in the first place. On America's new frontier--which has been pushed back by political will, not by individual self-interest--the pioneers must pursue a vision commensurate with the cost and the risk. Dangerous and expensive makework in orbit hardly fits the bill."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144008/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/6?accountid=14657,"Emerging from what had promised to be just one more futile all-night sitting, the European Community's farm ministers surprised the world on May 21st: they said they were close to agreement on reforming their common agricultural policy (see page 55). This promised deal matters not just for the EC's consumers and taxpayers, who have to pay the cost of the CAP's distorted prices and subsidies, but for people everywhere. The Uruguay round, paralysed for months by the dispute between America and Europe over agriculture, hangs on this deal, and on whether America is willing to accept it.
America should. Europe's likely new farm policy is nobody's idea of liberal trade in agriculture; it is not even as good as the earlier MacSharry plan, itself a compromise between reformers and protectionists. It will, however, be a step in the right direction--and it is almost certainly as far as the EC will go in 1992. America ought to bank what it has won, start plotting
new assault on the CAP for the late 1990s, and take credit for bringing the Uruguay round to a successful close this summer.
TIME TO DECLARE VICTORY
The benchmark set at the GATT talks for the reform of European farming was the plan suggested by Arthur Dunkel, the agency's director-general, last year. For cereals, where Europe and America have been furthest apart, the Dunkel plan called for cuts of 20% in the value of the CAP's production subsidies, of 36% in the value of its export subsidies, and of 24% in the volume of its subsidised exports. The new plan easily does the first two, but it fails to do the third.
The reason for that failure is simple. Europe aims to replace some subsidies to producers with direct payments. The effect of this switch on the EC's output of cereals will depend on precisely how the payments work. Tied to output, they would be a distortion by another name, and the switch would leave production--and hence the surplus wheat that has to be dumped on the market--unchanged. Entirely detached from output, they would cause production and the surplus to shrink.
Both the MacSharry plan and the new plan propose a form of direct payment that will buoy production: payments would be linked not to output itself, but both to the area of land under the crop and to a regional measure of yield. That barely weakens the link between support and output. The MacSharry plan went further, by shifting the cash away from big farmers--the biggest 20% now receive 80% of all subsidies--to small ones. Even so, it would not have cut production enough to reduce dumped exports by 24%. The new plan is worse, partly because it fails (at Britain's insistence) to curb payments to big farmers. So output would fall by even less than under the MacSharry plan; and the dumped surplus, which is what America and others care about, would fall by much less than 24%.
Note, too, that the new plan for cereals has much in common with the system the EC already uses for oil-seeds. A GATT panel has ruled that the oil-seed regime distorts trade; it wants the EC to change it. America may soon take reprisals against the Community as part of that dispute. Even this is not the end of the new plan's defects. The MacSharry plan recognised the concept of world-market prices--for the CAP, a breakthrough. The CAP price of wheat is 155 ecus ($208) a tonne; the market-clearing price is nearer 75 ecus. The MacSharry plan proposed a cut in the CAP price to 100 ecus and argued that, with some recovery in the world price, the CAP could move to world prices by 1996. The new plan proposes to cut the CAP price only to 110 ecus, and ministers are making no claims about when or whether fixed and free prices may converge.
Nobody's idea of liberal trade, indeed. So why should America go along with it? For two compelling reasons.
First, the agreement, for all its flaws, is still a radical reform of the CAP. The switch it proposes from rigged prices to direct payments was unthinkable not long ago. The new regime would still distort trade, but less than the present one. And it would make the costs of the CAP more visible, which prepares the way for further reforms later.
Second, if America says No, the Uruguay round seems certain to fold. The costs of that are too dreadful to contemplate. Agreements to move to freer trade in textiles and other industries would be lost; efforts to bring entirely new areas of trade (such as services, foreign investment and intellectual property) into the GATT's liberal, rules-based order would collapse; hopes of improving discipline over quotas and other forms of ""new protection"" would be dashed; agriculture would remain outside the GATT. Germany, whose sudden willingness to compromise on farm trade made the new plan possible, wants its chancellor, Helmut Kohl, to preside over a G7 summit this summer that announces a successful end to the Uruguay round. If that compromise proves to have been in vain, the prospects for more CAP reform will be zero.
America should declare victory. Today's prize is worth having, and the ideal of liberal trade will live to fight another day."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144289/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/7?accountid=14657,"""What does South Korea have that India doesn't?"" The thinking behind the remark of Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, is plain, though neither Mr. Singh nor any of his reformist colleagues in the government of P.V. Narasimha Rao will admit it. Their ambition is to raise India's economic performance not merely from dismal to respectable, but all the way to spectacular. At Korean rates of real GDP growth (9% a year), real incomes double in eight years and go up 13 times in 30 years. The difference is that, in India, the beneficiaries at the end of the day would number not 45m, as in South Korea now, but some 1-1/4 billion in 2020, nearly one-sixth of mankind. It can be done.
In less than a year India's prospects have been transformed. Last June the country was quivering from religious and caste violence and from Rajiv Gandhi's assassination at an election rally the month before. Economically, things were just as bad. The government's budget deficit stood at 9% of GDP. Economic growth had halted. Inflation, usually quite low, was in double figures. Foreign-exchange reserves had fallen to where they would cover only a few weeks' normal imports.
Little was expected of the 71-year-old Mr Rao when he took office. After the Congress party won the most seats (though not an overall majority) in the June election, it selected him as leader because he seemed both a Gandhi loyalist and an inoffensive time-server; a party hack who--with the added advantage of having had heart-bypass surgery--would be the perfect stop-gap for his ambitious colleagues.
Mr Rao surprised everyone by giving the economic portfolios to reformers. Finance went to Mr Singh, an economist who had been an ardent central planner in the 1970s but had since converted to the free-market cause. Commerce, which includes foreign trade, was given to P. Chidambaram, a young dynamo with a degree from Harvard Business School. Mr Rao then gave unqualified political backing to Mr Singh when the finance minister launched two waves of radical economic reforms.
India had the misfortune to achieve independence, in 1947, at a time when state intervention was seen by much of the world as the way both to economic justice and to economic growth. India needed both. Under Jawaharlal Nehru's guidance, it lumbered into this fashionable mire, got precious little of either, but has stayed bogged down there ever since. Mr Singh's reforms, which came first in a mini-budget last July, then in a full budget on February 29th, were the first real attempt to escape.
The reforms have given rise to hopes so high as to border dangerously on euphoria. The economy is, in fact, still in the dumps. Inflation is stuck at 12%, industrial output has fallen over the past year, unemployment is up. But the air of change is unmistakable. The slogans of religious hatred daubed on walls since last June have given way to ones chirping, ""Freed from fetters, forward we go."" Signs for Pepsi, a company kept out of India for years, are everywhere, offering ""the choice for a new generation.""
A more tangible sign of faith could be found in the Bombay stockmarket, which doubled last year, then madly redoubled in the first three months of 1992, though it has slumped sharply, amid cries of scandal, since then. A more solid sign is the state of the foreign-exchange reserves, which now are brimming. Toward the end of April, they had reached $6.5 billion. True, the IMF chipped in $2 billion or so last year. But most of the rest is from overseas Indians. They were the first to drain foreign exchange out of the country in the bad days of 1990-91. In the weeks after the February budget, an average of $50m of private money was pouring back each day.
There is a lot more where that came from. One investment banker in Bombay guesses that between $70 billion and $80 billion in flight capital is available for repatriation, if the reforms take root. For now, the government's problem is to keep the capital inflow from pushing the rupee up and ruining the export-boosting effect of recent devaluations.
OPENING UP
Last year's balance-of-payments crisis reflected a much worse chronic complaint. For nearly 40 years, India had one of the most inward-looking and heavily regulated economies in the world. Overseas trade was trivial. Inward investment was discouraged: in the late 1980s less than $100m a year in direct foreign investment was coming in, less than 2% of what was going at the time into China.
Much of industry was state-owned, inefficient and loss-making. The private sector did not perform much better, thanks to a comprehensive system if industrial licensing, which required a bureaucrat's permission before a factory could be set up or closed, and even before its capacity could be increased or shifted to other uses. Over the years 1950-80 India had one of the worst records of economic growth in Asia.
Already much has changed for the better. On the external side, the rupee has been devalued by about 30% since last May. Last July Mr Singh was talking about rupee convertibility in three to five years. In February he made the rupee partly convertible (60% of any exchange deal is at a market rate, 40% at a government-fixed rate). The guessing is that, provided India has a good harvest, the currency will be fully convertible before 1992 is out.
The government has been less bold with foreign trade. The quantitative import controls that used to keep almost everything out, unless a bureaucrat (often enough a bribed one) would let it in, have been done away with--except for consumer goods. Import tariffs have been lowered, but still have far to go: the top tariff rate has come down from 150% to 110%, the top rate for capital goods from 80% to 60%.
Foreign investors are no longer treated as evil exploiters. They can now own up to 51% of most local companies (in some cases more), use their brand names, buy property, open branch offices and accept deposits. They cannot yet invest directly in stockmarkets, but the government has promised that ""reputable"" foreigners such as pension funds will soon be allowed to do so.
Internally, the industrial-licensing system has been abolished, except for 18 industries, including (absurdly) cars, drugs and sugar. Only eight lines of business--compared with dozens before--are now reserved exclusively for government-owned companies. Steel prices have been decontrolled (though not steel distribution).
The official controller of capital issues, who had the magisterial power to tell issuers of securities what price their paper could be sold at, has been put out of business. Indian companies can, for the first time, issue paper on the Euromarkets, and four are about to do so. Privately owned mutual funds (though not foreign ones) can now be set up. The government is in principle willing to sell 49% of its shares in state-owned companies.
In sum, not a bonfire of controls, but still a healthy blaze. Belated maybe, but given India's political condition and its record since 1947, Messrs Rao and Singh deserve a place in history. What has been done so far is already enough, some reckon, to lift the country permanently to a GDP growth path of 5% a year. That would equal the growth of the 1980s, but on a far more solid footing: the economic spurt then was due partly to some modest reforms but also to a reckless and unsustainable expansion of the budget deficit.
The experience of the 1980s showed that poverty begins falling swiftly in India when the rate of growth reaches 5%. A sustained GDP growth rate of 9% a year would free most Indians from truly grinding poverty by 2000, and make 1 billion of them middle-class by 2020. That is not impossible. India has plenty of entrepreneurs--and plenty of savings. Yet the government may lack the will to seize its chance.
NOW FOR THE HARDER PART
However praiseworthy, everything done so far by Mr Singh has been politically easy--at least compared with the things that need to be done next. An intellectual conviction in favour of central planning and Fabian socialism has been overthrown. That is enormously important, but the people whose noses have thus been put out of joint are not a power in their own right. In contrast, none of the reforms has yet posed a big threat to the special-interest groups that are, and which dominate Indian politics. The changes that must be made if India is to take off will require the power of these interests to be broken. Will it happen?
The government has so far shrunk from four huge challenges: reform of the labour market, of the financial system, of agriculture and of its own finances.
* LABOUR. Most restrictions on setting up companies and on their production decisions have been abolished. But businesses need to close as well as open, and workers to be fired as well as hired. The licensing system dealt with these awkward facts by forbidding them to happen. It still does. Mr Rao and his colleagues cannot bring themselves to admit that their reforms will throw even a single Indian out of work.
Especially not if he works for the government. India's public sector in 1990 employed 18.7m people: not many in a national workforce of 325m, but still 71% of the jobs in the ""organised sector"", establishments with ten or more workers. Of the 18.7m, half worked in state industries or banks, the other half as civil servants (including teachers, doctors and nurses).
A job in the public sector, which is heavily unionised, has been thought of as a job for life. Mr Rao's government has done nothing to change that. The foreign-trade reforms have eliminated much of the work that the bureaucrats from export and import control used to do; tax reforms have significantly reduced the workload of tax collectors; one whole ministry has been abolished. Yet not one bureaucrat from any of those services has lost his job. Mr Singh says the government will rely on natural attrition to thin the ranks of civil servants.
The public enterprises, some owned by the central government and some by the governments of India's constituent states, present worse problems. Not only are they overmanned; their inefficiency is transmitted to the rest of the economy through high prices, bad products and poor services. One of the grossest examples is the electricity board of Uttar Pradesh, which employs 600,000 people and loses through pilferage 18% of the power that it generates. A survey of 233 of the better-run enterprises owned by the central government found that their return on equity in 1989-90 was just 0.9%.
The stronger the union in a state industry, the more precarious the business's finances. The railways employ 1.6m workers, at an average rate of pay 2-1/2 times the average Indian family income. It is little surprise that the government has to use its revenues to prop up these industries. Of the total allocated for capital investment by state-owned heavy industry in the 1991-92 budget, about 30% will have been financed by the taxpayer.
The need for a coherent bankruptcy policy is clear from the official figures for ""sick"" enterprises. In 1988 these numbered nearly 250,000, and they owed their banks 77 billion rupees ($2.7 billion). In theory, the privately owned firms on this list cannot close down without permission; in practice, about half of them have closed anyway. The government is loth to allow closures until a social safety net of some sort is in place. It is trying to create one through the National Renewal Fund, but the fund is growing much more slowly than the urgency of the industrial problem.
* THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. The state-owned banks, nationalised in two waves in the late 1960s and late 1970s, are incapable of providing the services of a modern financial system. It is hard to know who milks the banks more, their employees or the government. State-owned banks employ 900,000 workers, whose average pay is four times India's average family income. The militant bank unions not only push up wages, but also stoutly resist anything that might raise productivity. After years of struggle, they were at last persuaded by the banks to allow computerisation--in no more than a single branch of each bank.
The government, for its part, requires the banks to hold low-yielding government debt in an amount equal to 30% of their net deposits (down from 38.5%, thanks to a concession in this year's budget). They are also required to give credit to government-favoured borrowers like farmers. A survey of 50 big banks showed that, of the credit they extended between 1977 and 1990, 41% went to favoured borrowers, 15% or so to public-sector companies and another 2% to government agencies. One foreign banker in Bombay reckons that at least 20% of the state banks' loans are bad, and that their balance sheets are an average of 15-20% in the red and in some cases 50%.
Late last year a reform commission recommended a gradual reduction in government-directed investments and credits by banks, and said that new private banks should be allowed to open. The government is still dawdling.
* FARMING. In a country where three-quarters of the people and four-fifths of the really poor live in the countryside, policies to push up rural economic growth and channel help to the most needy would make sense. The government has mostly done the opposite. It has starved the country-side of investment. It has encouraged the production of crops like oilseeds and sugarcane, in which India has a comparative disadvantage, and discouraged crops like rice, wheat and cotton in which India is competitive. In keeping down food prices, it has hugely subsidised the urban middle class.
In 1991-92 central-government subsidies came to 104 billion rupees, with state-government subsidies adding another 106 billion rupees--the combined total equalled 10.5% of all government spending. Almost 80% of the centre's subsidies went, one way or another, to agriculture: mainly for fertilisers, debt relief for farmers and consumption subsidies for city-dwellers. Most of the subsidies from state governments went to provide cheap electricity and water for the better-off sort of farmer. Mr Singh tried to cut the growth in the fertiliser subsidy by 40%, but parliamentary pressure obliged him to settle for a 30% cut.
* GOVERNMENT FINANCES. These subsidies weigh heavily on the budget. The budget deficit plainly must come down, for the sake of the anti-inflation fight, if nothing else. And the government is indeed committed to cutting it, from 9% of GDP in 1990-91 to 6.5% in 1991-92 and 5% this fiscal year. But, with defence spending apparently untouchable, there can be no serious reduction without an attack on the government wage bill, state-enterprise incompetence, the losses of state-owned banks and farming subsidies.
The difficulty is compounded by the structure of India's taxes. Direct taxes account for only 20% of the central government's tax take, the rest being split about equally between excise taxes and import tariffs. This is perilous. The excisemen are a menace to industrial efficiency. Factories have to keep records even of scrap metal, because it has an excisable value. Tariffs must be brought sharply down, for the sake of further trade reform. But how can that be done, when they provide so much of the government's revenue?
NEEDED: A SUBCONTINENTAL THATCHER
The government has no intention at the moment of mounting a frontal assault on these obstacles. The country, says Mr Singh, in a cliche of development economics, needs ""adjustment with a human face"". A pause in reform will persist until the autumn in any event. The government is worried about what a bad monsoon would do to inflation and the public mood.
Thereafter, might the precarious position of Mr Rao's government prevent him from taking on the unions and the subsidy-eaters? Despite its lack of an overall parliamentary majority, the government is not under much threat from other parties. The left has self-destructed, and the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has little quarrel with Mr Rao's economic policy. But within Congress itself there could be trouble. It remains a nest of special-interest politics, influence-peddling, corruption and blind ambition. At the party congress last month, only a tenth of the delegates bothered to turn up for Mr Singh's speech on economic policy. The rest were in the corridors, hotly lobbying over the impending elections to the party's central committee.
On the other hand, an attack on the bureaucracy and the unions should have a strong populist appeal. The bureaucrats, bank workers and subsidised land-owners are among India's privileged (which is why they have so much clout in Delhi). The average voter would be delighted to see them cut down to size.
That is not the instinct of Mr Rao's government. Everyone recalls that one excuse given for Indira Gandhi's declaration of a state of emergency in 1977 was the prospect of a crippling strike by the railway unions. The Rao team would prefer to approach the questions of overmanning and inefficiency slowly and quietly. They cannot ""undo all the iniquities of history in a short period"", says Mr Singh. Though businessmen already report a more realistic attitude among some unions, he adds that ""we can't shout from the housetops"" that enterprises are closing and jobs being lost.
This cautious approach has its merits. The danger with it is that, lacking the crisp and simple explanations that gave the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions popular appeal, the Rao reforms will lose the support of the mass of Indians and the reforms themselves will simply peter out. It happened before, with the less sweeping reforms of the late 1970s and of 1984-85. It would be a tragedy if, having begun so well, Mr Rao and Mr Singh were to stop half-way."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144135/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/8?accountid=14657,"Not a great deal has happened since some Los Angelenos torched parts of their city three weeks ago. Much, it is true, has been made of the ""momentous"" truce in gangland. Louts and sworn enemies such as ""Li'l Monster"" of the Eight-Tray Gangster Crips and ""Bone"" of the Athens Park Bloods now appear together on television programmes. Their views are so earnestly sought that they are booked on the college lecture circuit.
Meanwhile Peter Ueberroth, the businessman in charge of rebuilding Los Angeles, is scampering around the city trying to put his team together. Mr Ueberroth has promised to be ruthless in getting money from businessmen by ""holding their feet to the fire"". But that is not his only challenge. To pick his team, he will have to choose perhaps 500 names from over 5,000 applicants. Koreans, who bore the brunt of the riots, want their representatives; Latinos are talking about filling half the posts. To complicate matters, Mr Ueberroth is white and does not live in Los Angeles.
Local politics, on the other hand, has barely stirred. Neither the Los Angeles city council nor the powerful county board of supervisors has said much; California's congressional delegation has not even bothered to meet. Only Maxine Waters, the congresswoman whose district covers South Central Los Angeles, speaks loudly and often about the city's problems. And she, by refusing to condemn those of her constituents who are rioters, is fast losing an audience.
In Washington, meanwhile, a bipartisan effort to revive America's cities already looks as patched-together and shaky as the gangland truce. On May 12th George Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress met to discuss how to proceed with an urban agenda. On May 14th the House of Representatives voted on the first of the president's proposals, a bill to make available $820m in small-business loans and disaster grants to fire-damaged Los Angeles as well as to waterlogged Chicago. Two-thirds of House Republicans, mostly representing rural and suburban districts, voted against the measure. The bill has now gone to the Senate, where it has been threatened with $1.5 billion of scatter-shot additions; enough to make Mr Bush exercise his veto.
All this bodes ill for the rest of the president's already modest legislative package. The first part of it, known as weed and seed"", is meant to flush criminals and drug dealers from the slums and then revive these areas with education, health and housing initiatives. The second is designed to help poor people start accumulating assets, both by owning their own homes and by saving more than is allowed under current welfare rules. The third aims to set up federal enterprise zones (ie, tax havens) in poor urban areas.
Mr Bush's more loyal aides insist that this is the president's long and fervently held city agenda. This is bosh, for until three weeks ago it belonged only to Jack Kemp, the president's housing secretary. Moreover, the scope of the proposed programmes is small: $500m nationwide for ""weed and seed"", and $1 billion to cover home-ownership programmes for just 36,000 families. As for enterprise zones, in the long run education and training will count for much more than the few new jobs these might create (South Central Los Angeles has one already). His aides hope, nonetheless, that Mr Bush will now look presidential on the cities, rather than hapless. Those closest to him wish the whole subject of cities would go away.
The truth about the looming mass of federal legislation (from Democrats as well as the administration) is that nearly all of it is unnecessary. The answers to many of America's most pressing urban problems are more likely to be found in the cities themselves. All over the United States, local groups (often not-for-profit organisations) and even individuals have found ways to tackle urban illiteracy, delinquency and joblessness, which big government has failed to do.
For instance, where young teenage mothers in Chicago were individually ""mentored"" by older, educated women, the high-school drop-out rate for teenage mothers fell. In the Adams-Morgan district of Washington, DC, an education and training programme enabling youths to run small businesses led to a sharp fall in participants' arrests--and to continually profitable enterprises. Private-sector attempts to prepare school-leavers and drop-outs for work have proved much more successful than federal attempts through the Job Training Partnership Act, which has just been extended. In Alexandria, Virginia, Ramona Younger did what the police failed to do. She drove the drug dealers out of town--shaming them through a megaphone every night for a year.
Uncomfortably for legislators, there is no unifying theme that ties the nation's thousands of little experiments together--perhaps because potential inner-city dropouts need to be helped back almost one by one. But in 1990 the Milton Eisenhower Foundation drew a number of lessons from a range of programmes. It found that nonprofit organisations, not government, were often best placed to set youth and community programmes in motion; that too much, by contrast, was expected of volunteers; and that, too often, ventures failed because they did not have enough money.
All common sense, maybe. But there is no chance that Washington will replace policy waffle with the $30 billion a year that the Eisenhower Foundation reckons is necessary to pay for basic inner-city education and social programmes. The unfortunate truth for a federal government which would like to come up with lots of new initiatives and not spend any money is that it would be more useful to do the opposite."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224155227/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/9?accountid=14657,"On May 19th Brian Mulroney, the prime minister of Canada, arrived in Washington for two days of meetings. He and George Bush had much to talk about, including their attendance at the Rio Earth Summit and the usual niggling trade frictions between their countries. In all likelihood, however, they talked mostly about the state of the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which will extend to Mexico the benefits of the four-year-old American-Canadian free-trade area.
The week before Mr Mulroney's visit, the NAFTA working parties had met in plenary session in Toronto. Certain sticking points--the amount of local content required for cars, the possibility of foreign investment in Mexico's constitutionally protected energy industry--are hardy perennials; tough bargaining still lies ahead. But there is a palpable sense of optimism that a text will be agreed upon before the autumn. Mr Bush will probably present the treaty to Congress shortly before the November elections. He will not expect Congress to vote on the text this year, but in politically important border states like Texas, keen on free trade with Mexico, he will be able to claim that he has done his bit for their interests.
If a free-trade agreement is concluded next year, it will be a triumph not only for the government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, which has opened Mexico's economy to the world, but also for Mr Bush. Many American presidents have talked of free trade with Mexico; none before Mr Bush has done much about it. His own interest in Mexico, and his ability to work closely with Mr Salinas, have helped to put relations between the two countries on their best footing for nearly 30 years.
In Ronald Reagan's day, the continent south of the Rio Grande seemed less a neighbour than a threat--whether because of drugs, or debt, or (in central America) because the Reagan administration was convinced it had to stop Soviet designs on the hemisphere. Early in Mr Bush's term the administration, led by Congress, decided to end support for the rebels in Nicaragua. Then, in June 1990 (two weeks after Mr Salinas and Mr Bush declared their intention of negotiating a free-trade pact), the administration tried to put policy on a new footing by unveiling the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI).
The EAI was designed to encourage economic liberalisation in the hemisphere by promising reforming countries free trade with the United States. It was also intended to ease new investment with, for example, funds from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to assist privatisation. And it promised continuing relief from debt burdens in exchange for economic reform, including reducing the burden of American foreign-aid loans in exchange for a commitment by the borrowers to do more for the environment.
The United States has now signed ""framework agreements"", setting out mutual agendas for free trade, that cover 31 cowntries. Only Cuba, Suriname and Haiti are left out in the cold. In the case of Chile, the administration has gone further. When Patricio Aylwin, the president of Chile, visited Washington on May 13th, Mr Bush said that the United States intends to negotiate a ""comprehensive free-trade agreement with Chile"" once the NAFTA is completed.
Congress is less enthusiastic. Caught both by budgetary constraints on ""new"" programmes and by the usual wrangling over foreign aid, it has given the EAI little support. A mere $300m, intended to go to a multilateral investment fund run by the IDB, was never appropriated. The administration did not get congressional approval for all the debt relief it sought in fiscal 1992; in fiscal 1993 it may well get nothing at all.
There are signs, too, that the EAI may be surfacing as a political issue in the United States. In hearings on trade policy before the Democratic Party's platform committee recently, a representative of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union--the leading textile union--lumped the EAI with the NAFTA as a means ""purely and simply of further export of much needed jobs"" from the United States. And what is the United States getting in return?
As the chart on the previous page shows, the proportion of American exports that goes to other countries in the hemisphere is well down from its levels between 1950 and 1960. (Chart omitted) Exports to Canada now account for much more than half of the total. In 1991 they were worth $85.1 billion, compared with $63.3 billion for the rest of the hemisphere; and of the latter figure, 52% went to Mexico. Exports from the United States to Latin America may be booming (they leapt 16.6% by value in 1991 over 1990, compared with 5% for all other parts of the world); but, outside Mexico, Latin American markets for American goods are small. The United States exports more by value to Hong Kong and Singapore than it does to Brazil.
In short, without an administration determined to push for a new view of the hemisphere--and many observers think the men around Mr Bush are losing their enthusiasm for the EAI--a revisionist approach might take root. Such an approach would accept that the American and Canadian economies are deeply intertwined and that ties with Mexico should be closer. But revisionists would then point out that incomes in Latin America are still small, that growth is slower than it is in Asia, that drugs will continue to pour in from the south, and that not every country on the continent is a model of stablity. The United States may have some interests there; but are these vital enough to risk the loss of political capital at home?"
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144075/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/10?accountid=14657,"Budget time is proving uncomfortable for California. The state needs $60 billion for fiscal 1992-93, but tax revenues have been sharply reduced by the recession. The population, clamouring for services, continues to grow. Unexpected disasters--the fires in Oakland, the riots in Los Angeles--have also added extra costs. Although the federal government has promised $600m in low-interest rebuilding loans in Los Angeles, and private companies are helping, the costs to the state for extra policing and help to the cities may go as high as $1 billion.
California is not allowed to run a deficit, and the word is never mentioned. Nevertheless, last year the state fell $14 billion short of what it needed to operate as usual. To bride that gap, the government cut services and added $7 billion in new taxes. The result was a deficit of $3.7 billion which the governor, Pete Wilson, feared might grow to $4 billion-6 billion in the fiscal year that begins on July 1st. However, the latest figures show that income tax returns, corporate-tax payments and sales taxes (all affected by recession) have brought in even less than expected, leaving a projected gap in this fiscal year of $10.7 billion: the second-largest revenue shortfall in state history. That bodes even worse for the deficit next year.
Since neither the Republican governor nor the Democratic legislators dare talk of any more new taxes, services will have to bear the brunt of fiscal pruning. Every department and agency in the state, and all county governments, are bracing themselves for budget cuts of 15-30% on top of the cuts of last year. Schools foresee that sport, music and art lessons may disappear, and that teachers may have to buy supplies out of their own pockets. The Los Angeles school systems may shorten the school year by several days in order to keep within budget. The state university system, which had already eliminated 5,000 classes on its 20 campuses, may have to put up student fees by 40%.
Mr Wilson and the legislators will try to agree on next year's budget in talks between June 2nd and June 15th. The starting date, not coincidentally, is also the date of California's primary election. No politician dare mention cuts for schools, health-care or road repair before the people have gone to the polls, and no vote on individual reductions will be taken until well afterwards.
Political delay only adds to the urgency. California is simply out of cash. Just to meet its payroll on June 30th, the state was forced last week to borrow $750m. If a new budget is not in place by July 1st, California will be forced to issue registered warrants--official IOUs--to pay its bills. It has not been reduced to that since the 1930s.
The new finance report, published on May 20th, includes a blunt warning. Recovery from the recession, it says, ""is not yet visible in California."""
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224148869/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/11?accountid=14657,"When, a television evangelist buys one of the country's best-known wire services out of bankruptcy, one might expect America's press to have a fit of indignation. When that televangelist is widely expected to run for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, the indignation might well be increased. Yet the American media have been strangely calm about Pat Robertson's $6m purchase of United Press International (UPI). Mr. Robertson, clearly, is now accepted more as a businessman in this world than as a prophet of the next. And he could not be more delighted.
If Mr. Robertson is indeed a businessman, he is a rare one. Made by the 1980s, he was not undone by them. Mr. Robertson founded what came to be the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) near the fleshpots of Virginia Beach in 1959; his well-known religious talk-cum-healing show, the 700 Club, began in 1966. His businesses nearly floundered more than once. During the 1980s, on the other hand, Mr. Robertson threw out much of his religious broadcasting, substituting popular family programmes like ""The Waltons"" and ""Gunsmoke"" instead.
With the centrepiece of Mr. Robertson's activities renamed the Family Channel, viewers and revenues soared. Now 55m households subscribe by cable to the Family Channel, which is worth probably $500m. This secular success has, as David Harrell of Auburn University, a biographer of Mr. Robertson, puts it, ""endowed his ministry into perpetuity"".
Because it was so profitable, the Family Channel had to be spun off in 1990 from the tax-exempt CBN, which got around $100m from the sale. Mr. Robertson also has two networks of radio stations--with 470 affiliates in America alone. Mr. Robertson says he is primarily interested in UPI for its use in radio operations, particularly in Latin America and the Middle East (CBN has a station in south Lebanon), and also has plans to use UPI in television. UPI's staff, who have been looking for a white knight for five years, do not fear they will be used to further their boss's political ambitions.
Even so, Mr. Robertson, who ran for president in 1988, has built up a grass-roots organisation through CBN that would be the envy of any Republican hopeful in 1996. The 700 Club, for example, has branches in many cities across America. And Mr. Robertson also has Operation Blessing.
Last month this charity got in touch with the United Mine Workers and offered to supply food to hungry ex-miners in West Virginia, where the coal industry has been ravaged over the past decade. Operation Blessing promptly supplied 221,000lb of sweet, white and red potatoes, kidney beans and rice to hungry ex-miners in West Virginia. The produce, too poor for supermarkets, was given free by farmers. As for the miners, there were ""gangs of them"", one union worker says, ""more than there was food for"". Mr. Robertson would have been known to them all.
He denies, however, that he has any intention of running again in 1996. He says he will be happy to influence the process by promoting Christian and ""family"" values from the outside. Besides, he is convinced that the Democrats will win the White House that year.
On the other hand, he cannot see any televangelist better qualified than himself. ""It's a question of background,"" he says. He himself is descended from the Duke of Marlborough and from two American presidents; his father was a senator for Virginia for some years. ""I have a bit broader background"", he points out, ""than someone whose education involves bible-school someplace."""
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224147851/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/12?accountid=14657,"It was a typical flustered compromise, pleasing nobody. On May 14th the Bush administration announced that it will allow the northern spotted owl to perish across half its range in order to spare several thousand forestry jobs. Both greens and loggers had hoped for more; both will loathe and blame each other. Yet they face a common enemy: the Forest Service, whose thankless job is to maintain American forests with an eye both to the economy and to the environment.
Throughout the West, the Forest Service stands accused of failing in its basic task: ensuring a supply of trees for future generations. In California the agency has had to launch an investigation into whether its own employees are stealing logs. In Montana it has gone along with a plan to log areas where grizzly bears live. And in Washington and Oregon the service is accused of mismanaging vast forests, leaving the trees to die from insects and disease.
Attacks come from within as well as without, as angry employees take their complaints before Congress. John Mumma, a former head of national forests in Idaho and Montana, has claimed he was forced from his post and given a Washington desk job after he objected to logging quotas. John McCormick, another veteran of the service, has told tales of illegal heavy machinery tearing up the forests, of officials who let private timber companies choose which public tracts they want to cut, and even of ""love vans"", paid for by taxpayers, carrying prostitutes to woodland assignations with forestry workers. Many employees claim the agency has been padding its tree stocks by leaving on the books, under ""forests"", swathes of land long since cleared of trees. If stocks seem high, the agency can make a bigger cut than would otherwise be allowed.
The Forest Service's chief concern is not, apparently, to preserve forests, but to preserve itself. Congress will reward it with larger budgets only if it cuts more trees; so, if they want to do something good for forests, foresters must first hack some of them down. This led to a ridiculous scene in an Idaho national forest, when a Forest Service employee was given the task of standing in a desert of tree stumps to explain to angry visitors the benefits of clear-cutting. His salary was paid by cutting down more trees.
The two incompatible assignments of the Forest Service, to protect forests while developing them for harvest, could be juggled for the first two-thirds of this century. In those days forests, especially in the West, were still vast enough to accommodate both loggers and campers. Today the battle is over control of a much smaller amount of forested land--perhaps only 5% of the forests that once covered America--and the Forest Service is helpless to referee it.
The agency became tightly enmeshed with timber-industry interests in the years after the second world war, when politicians began to use the Forest Service as a base of patronage and job creation. The most egregious example of this is the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, where huge stands of trees are being cut for low-value pulp simply to create jobs.
Better ideas for the future of the service are now proposed by Barney Dowdle, a forestry professor and economist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Mr Dowdle has long been a pariah in Forest Service circles, although his ideas are now slowly gaining ground, and he has even been asked to explain them to service employees.
The flaw in the service, Mr Dowdle says, is that it is based on a forest-management model imported from 19th-century Germany. That model, in turn, was inherited from feudal land practices, when lords of the manor would limit the peasants' harvest of trees to ensure a steady supply. Modern foresters call this ""sustained yield"", and it has been drummed into their heads for generations.
The problem, Mr Dowdle argues, is that this ignores market forces by requiring an annual, pre-determined level of production. This destabilises the industry, constricting supply when demand is high and flooding the market when it is low. Mr Dowdle's solution is to set aside those forests that attract campers, or are simply beautiful, and privatise the rest. Alternatively, the market could be turned loose on timber sales. At present, a timber company can acquire a parcel of Forest Service trees by bidding unrealistically high, then making a low down payment. If the price of wood does not rise enough to match the full contract price, the buyer can simply go bust and emerge under a different name later. The system rewards those who take the wildest risk, while driving out the temperate.
If payment were made up front, says Mr Dowdle, the bids would more accurately reflect the value of the wood. He would allow speculators into the market (a practice now forbidden) to help spread the risk, and create a commodities market for timber futures like those for grain, oil and pork bellies. The result, he insists, would be a stable market for logging companies, and one that is free of political influence. Even greens would be happy, because the system would ensure better management of forests. ""Right now, good forestry means cutting your inventory and getting the hell out,"" Mr Dowdle says: just as Georgia-Pacific did when it fled the north-west for the south, which is thick with private forests.
The Forest Service is not lacking in assets. Its timber holdings are conservatively valued at $50 billion, a figure that would place it among the largest corporations in the United States. Yet it loses millions of dollars each year by, for example, building roads to forests where there are few harvestable trees. Randal O'Toole, a forest economist with Cascade Holistic Economic Consultants in Portland, says that the agency could earn perhaps $5 billion a year simply by charging fees to hikers and hunters, a practice that private timber companies in the south have found quite lucrative.
At present, however, Congress does not allow it. If the Forest Service wants to pay for trails, it must cut down trees. In this it mimics another medieval technique: bleeding a patient, even if it kills him."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224176015/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/13?accountid=14657,"Nearly 30 years after he first charmed late-night television viewers with ""The Tonight Show"", Johnny Carson started his last week on the job by inviting back two of the guests on his first show. Mel Brooks told old jokes; Tony Bennett sang old songs. A cosy banality suffused the proceedings (""Tell me"", said Johnny to Tony, ""do you ever think about the passage of time?"" ""It seems to have gone very fast,"" said Tony.) And so it has been for the past few months, as stars of a certain vintage line up for one last show with the master. Bob Hope came (he has appeared 132 times), seeming not quite 12 annas to the rupee; Elizabeth Taylor, who had never agreed to appear before, showed up looking like a 60-year-old biker's moll, spray-on jeans and all.
Mr Carson's retirement has provoked a flood of nostalgia and analysis, from People magazine's pithy judgment that the great man was ""hip but not bicoastal"", to the New York Times's post-Freudian analysis of why America never dreams of him. Everyone seems to agree that Mr Carson was a symbol of something: but the question remains, a symbol of exactly what?
At one level, Mr Carson symbolises the shift of America's cultural centre from New York to Los Angeles. ""The Tonight Show"" was produced in the Rockefeller Centre until 1972, when it moved to Burbank, in the San Fernando Valley, butt of a thousand Carson jokes. As the Carson show (and, for that matter, the rest of the television industry) went, so went other parts of the entertainment business. Tin Pan Alley was in New York; now the music business is almost entirely concentrated in southern California. For all the chatter about Los Angeles as a great international city, you can make a respectable argument that a cultural life that takes its beat from eastward-looking New York is more cosmopolitan than one dominated by Los Angeles. Since the entertainment business went west, American audiences have grown steadily more parochial. Between 1969 and 1990 the share of imported films in American cinemas' box-office takings dropped from 7.2% to 1.4%.
Second, Mr Carson could be seen as a symbol of an easy, gentle approach to politicians and their foibles. To be sure, Mr Carson can tell good political jokes (when an audience went wild at his entry on May 19th, he said that he felt like Ross Perot: ""You love me, and I haven't said a damn thing."") But compared with the competition on other late-night shows, and compared with Jay Leno, his successor on ""The Tonight Show"" and long-time stand-in for Mr Carson, the political jokes are less pointed. Consider Mr Leno on the unfairness of blaming George Bush for the recession: ""Come on, he wasn't even in the country when it was going on.""
Mr Carson's political jokes are also less frequent. Through the good offices of Robert Lichter at Washington's Centre for Media and Public Affairs, it can be revealed that, between 1989 and April 1992, Mr Carson told an average of 6.4 political jokes a show while Mr Leno averaged 9.6. Their targets were slightly different, too; Mr Leno told fewer jokes than Mr Carson about Bill Clinton and more about John Sununu, George Bush's former chief of staff. (The favourite targets of both men were George Bush and vice-president Dan Quayle, although pundits should note that of the 251 Quayle jokes the two comics have told since 1989, only 17 were broadcast this year.) Since all the other late-night TV hosts are even less establishment-minded than Mr Leno, Republicans should beware: with the retirement of Mr Carson, pre-bedtime viewing may become more explicitly Democratic.
Mr Carson's main claim to symbolic worth, however, is that he represents the middle-American ""mainstream"", and that his passing confirms the fragmentation of a culture. That is fair enough, so far as it goes; with three competitors (soon to be four), Mr Leno will not dominate the market as Mr Carson once did. And, if you are really keen on symbolism, you can find it in the replacement of (white) Doc Severinsen, Mr Carson's veteran bandleader, who played 1940s easy-listening classics, with the cool jazz of (black) Branford Marsalis, who will be Mr Leno's sidekick.
But turning Mr Carson into an icon of a now-vanishing unified culture is a bit difficult, because far fewer people ever watched him than most pundits seem to think. In the current season, his show has averaged a five-point audience rating (each point represents 900,000 households), and even in its heyday 20 years ago it rarely exceeded nine points. A real prime-time hit now gets a rating of about 21; the 50th-most-popular television show this season has averaged a rating of 10-11 points.
Even more pertinently, look at Arsenio Hall, who will be Mr Leno's main competitor, and who is everything that Mr Carson is not. Mr Hall is 37, not 66; black, not white; Cleveland-born street-cred, not Nebraska-born farm-wise; into rock screechers, not ageing crooners. Where Mr Carson wears earth-tone sports coats, Mr Hall sees every night as a fresh challenge to his ambition to wear every colour of the rainbow at once. Where Mr Carson tells gentle political jokes, Mr Hall holds electronic town-meetings for the folk of South Central Los Angeles. Mr Hall has said that his show is not aimed at ""Johnny's crowd, but at Johnny's crowd's kids.""
And there are now more of the latter than the former. According to a recent poll for the Times-Mirror group, 30% of respondents said they watched Mr Carson ""regularly"" or ""sometimes"", compared with 35% who watched Mr Hall. So in today's America it could be argued that it is Mr Hall, not Mr Carson, who represents the mainstream."

Units of policemen, who the night before had failed to control a huge demonstration, were withdrawn from the streets. More infantry units were brought in from outside Bangkok. After dark the peasant conscripts were let loose on the mainly middle-class people protesting against military rule.
The government at first tried to say nobody had been shot. By May 20th it had admitted that at least 40 people were dead and another 600 injured. Hundreds more were stripped, beaten and then bundled into trucks and driven off to prison. Chamlong Srimuang, the former governor of Bangkok, who has become the rallying-point for pro-democracy protests, was arrested--but later released after the king intervened--and a curfew was imposed on Bangkok. In only four days the army had converted Thailand from a dynamic country with a bright future into a banana republic, maybe on the verge of further bloodshed.
Too late the generals realised the extent of the damage they had caused. Their televised climbdown on the night of May 20th was a moral victory for unarmed civilians. But the army is unlikely to give up its grip on power so readily.
This grip is all-embracing. To understand how the Thai army works, it is best to think of it not as a military organisation but as a commercial one, whose aim is to run Thailand as a business.
The amount of time Thailand's 500-odd generals spend with their men is minimal. Instead, they are busy pursuing their private business interests, running the large state-owned enterprises that retain monopolies on some of the more lucrative bits of the economy, and ensuring that the military men's voice is always heard in politics. All the main participants in the current crisis--Mr Chamlong, Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who now leads the largest opposition party, and Suchinda Kraprayoon, the unelected prime minister--are former generals.
When Mr Suchinda led a coup in February 1991, overthrowing an elected government, no one protested. Many welcomed the demise of what, even by Thai standards, had been a particularly corrupt government. Mr Suchinda then appointed a civilian team, led by Anand Panyarachun, which may be remembered as one of the more honest and effective governments Thailand has had. To his credit, Mr Suchinda backed the Anand government, even when it took decisions that angered his fellow officers.
But the credit Mr Suchinda won for appointing Mr Anand evaporated when he let himself be nominated as prime minister after the election on March 22nd, even though he had promised repeatedly that he had no political ambitions. The anger of the people of Bangkok at this disregard of the election results was transformed into support for Mr Chamlong when he started a hunger strike at the beginning of May.
Many observers of the demonstration called by Mr Chamlong on May 17th, and its bloody aftermath, believe there was more behind it than just a battle of wills between the two former officers. There was a marked difference between the behaviour of the 200,000 people who came to hear Mr Chamlong speak, most of them solidly comfortable Thais, and the gangs of youths, many mounted on motorbikes, who roamed the crowd's edge and gave the security forces their pretext to move in.
Mr Suchinda claimed that he had to send in troops to deal with a crowd of communists and mobsters. Although the idea of communists is ludicrous in ebulliently capitalist Bangkok, he may have been right about the mobs. Several groups have an interest in stirring up trouble. Mr Chavalit spent heavily in the March election, leaving him, according to rumours in the Bangkok stockmarket before the May 17th rally, out of cash. Might he have hired trouble-makers in a last-ditch attempt to remove his former subordinate, Mr Suchinda? Another theory suggests that Mr Suchinda's rivals in the armed forces are anxious to discredit him so that they can assume power.
Either way, Mr Suchinda has no political future. After the events of the past week he will not be able to persuade Bangkok's middle class to trust him. That is the easy part to predict. But how will he be dumped?
Perhaps a split in the armed forces will bring his downfall. Thai military politics revolves around who graduated when from the Chulachomklao military academy. Mr Suchinda, Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme commander, and the army commander (who is Mr Suchinda's brother-in-law) all belong to the fifth class to graduate from this academy.
Other classes resent class five's dominance. In particular, their juniors by two years, class seven, fear they will be passed over for promotion unless class five can be eased out of power soon. Mr Chamlong is a graduate of class seven. He rose to prominence as the chief of staff to Prem Tinsulanonda, another ex-general, who served as prime minister for eight years. According to a rumour on May 20th, troops loyal to Mr Prem--and by extension, Mr Chamlong--were preparing to enter Bangkok to force Mr Suchinda's resignation.
A military insurrection might win support among the junior officers ordered to fire into the crowds. One, asked how he felt about facing the demonstrators, replied that shooting civilians was ""all wrong"".
Many Thais hope that the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej has saved his country from a civil war. He appeared unexpectedly on Thai television on May 20th with Mr Suchinda and Mr Chamlong and said the two men should work together to restore order. As is the royal tradition, they approached the king on their knees. The king appointed Mr Prem, now one of the king's advisers, as their go-between in subsequent negotiations. He did not say Mr Suchinda should resign. Before the shootings, officials at the court had implied that the king supported Mr Suchinda as the least bad option.
The king is in a difficult position. A coup in 1932 removed most of the monarchy's powers. His strength comes from the respect he commands in Thai society.
His skill and tact may have defused the present crisis. Far-sighted Thais are now pondering what will happen in a similar crisis when, or if, the country is ruled by his hot-headed son, the crown prince. All the more reason to hope that democracy will resume its progress in Thailand."

The people these days who find Bougainvillians perfidious are not whites but their fellow Melanesians in Papua New Guinea.
When Australia granted independence to PNG in 1975, Bougainville pleaded for its own independence, claiming that it had its distinct culture and noting that it was 900 kilometres (560 miles) from the capital, Port Moresby. But the Australians decided that PNG needed the revenue from Bougainville's huge copper mine at Panguna. Bougainville accepted the decision reluctantly, but in 1988 a group calling itself the Bougainville Revolutionary Army renewed calls for independence and attacked workers at the mine. The mine is now closed.
The government of PNG has been sympathetic to the aspirations of the Bougainvillians, and has allowed them a lot of autonomy. In 1990 PNG withdrew all its soldiers from the island in return for a promise by the rebels to negotiate. In 1991 the two sides signed an agreement under which soldiers from other Pacific countries would help to keep the peace. Nothing came of it. The Revolutionary Army continues to demand independence. On May 13th PNG sent its soldiers back to the south of Bougainville, where most of the population of 110,000 live. The government said the soldiers would protect village chiefs who opposed the rebels.
The little war has resulted in the deaths of perhaps 150 people--not many compared with, say, the numbers killed in the rebellion in Sri Lanka. But Pacific islanders consider it the most alarming event in their region since the military coup in Fiji in 1988. Armed conflict is not ""the Pacific way"", they say. They argue that the problem is the result of Europeans from de Bougainville onwards ""discovering"" lands and calling them their own. Even missionaries would ""buy"" a plot for a bar of soap. The Panguna copper deposits were found by Australians who at first offered the local people nothing.
The Australian company that eventually developed the mine, CRA, a subsidiary of RTZ, did a deal with PNG that provided the government with, it was reckoned, $1,000 a minute. Bougainvillians felt they were being cheated. An early demand by the rebels was for $11.5 billion to compensate landowners and to fill in the hole made by the mine.
They may indeed eventually get a generous settlement, financially and politically. On May 18th Papua New Guinea's foreign minister, Sir Michael Somare, said he wanted CRA to be replaced as the major shareholder in Panguna. Developers of mineral resources were taking the country for a ride, he said. Sir Michael's Pangu Pati, the Leading party in the government coalition, is looking for votes in the general election on June 25th. More money in the kitty to buy peace in Bougainville would be popular. War-weary Bougainville might be willing to accept a deal that included ""free association"", implying something more than autonomy but less than full sovereignty. The perfidiousness of the Bougainvillians would then be the only obstacle."

Yawara Hata, a respected 81-year-old left-winger, had been expecting to coast to a sixth four-year-term. Saitama is one of only four socialist strongholds among Japan's 47 prefectures. But last week Mr Hata unexpectedly said he was stepping down. Odder still, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party then tried to get its own man, Yoshihiko Tsuchiya, to pull out of the contest. What was happening?
Back in February the Liberal Democrats' leaders persuaded Mr Tsuchiya to stand for the governorship. They saw him as a strong candidate. As a former speaker of the upper house of the Diet (parliament), Mr Tsuchiya has the rank of an ex-prime minister, and he agonised before agreeing to let himself be ""demoted"" as a candidate for a mere governorship. Belatedly, the ruling party found to its horror that Mr Tsuchiya had no hope against the popular Mr Hata. Not only would their man lose, but he would have to surrender his own upper-house seat (also in Saitama) three weeks beforehand. This would mean a by-election, which the party might also lose. And all this on the eve of the main upper-house elections in July.
That was when the long shadow of Shin Kanemaru, the ageing don of the Liberal Democrats, flitted across Saitama. He struck a deal with the Social Democrats (formerly the socialists). They would dump Mr Hata. In exchange, the Liberal Democrats would have Mr Tsuchiya stand down, and back any candidate of the opposition's choosing, provided that the ruling party could claim to have forced Mr Hata from office. Social Democrats were to be taken care of in other ways--possibly even having a few of them in the next government.
What followed might have surprised even Machiavelli. On May 11th Mr Hata declared his ""100% commitment"" to stand for re-election. Next day newspapers splashed a story leaked by Kyowa Saitama Bank about large donations to a religious organisation from a big construction firm. The religious group turned out to have close connections with Mr Hata's office. By the afternoon the governor had announced that he would not be standing for re-election after all.
Accusations were made about bid-rigging for building contracts worth Y82 billion ($635m) handed out by the Saitama prefectural government. The Fair Trade Commission had been investigating 66 building firms in Saitama for operating a cartel. Three days after the story broke--and Mr Hata had called it quits--the commission dropped its case. Why should it do that? Good question, agree local residents.
Now the Liberal Democrats cannot deliver their side of the bargain: Mr Tsuchiya is refusing to stand down. Many Saitama voters are angry enough to cast their vote for anybody but the ruling party's man. It looks as though the ruling party faces the prospect of two highly conspicuous and humiliating defeats in Saitama.
The likely upshot is that a head or two will roll. Ichiro Ozawa was forced to resign as secretary-general of the Liberal Democrats when he backed the wrong man in the Tokyo governor's election in April 1991. Once again it was the party's secretary-general, now Tamisuke Watanuki, who backed the wrong candidate this time. So did the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. Both may have to pay the price come July."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224146180/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/17?accountid=14657,"Freedom from its cold-war constraints may have gone a bit to the UN Security Council's head. Charged nearly half a century ago with keeping the international peace, it suddenly finds that it has the chance to do so, embarking on as many peacekeeping jobs in the past four years as in the previous 40. Expectations have never been higher: the UN is now routinely looked to for help to stop horrid things happening: people killing each other, for instance. But Boutros Boutros Ghali, the Egyptian who took over as secretary-general in the new year, is dripping cold water on the excitement. If the UN is to maintain its credibility, he says, it has to conserve its resources--unless its members are prepared to approach peacekeeping in a more serious and generous spirit.
On May 13th Mr Boutros Ghali told the Security Council that it was impractical to send UN peacekeepers to Bosnia while the war there was still pursued with such ferocity. If the council members wanted to intervene, they should not try to do so on the cheap; they would have to consider sending in tens of thousands of troops equipped with offensive capability. Even if they opted, at this stage, only for armed escorts to protect the relief convoys, they would have to think along similarly expansive lines; a convoy led by the UN had been brutally ambushed by Muslim militiamen. But the council, ignoring his warning, voted two days later for the provision of armed escorts without going into their military needs.
The new secretary-general, who for many years was the eminence grise of Egyptian foreign policy, is not a table-thumper, a politician or even a good speaker. But he is beginning to show a sure touch and may be less worried than his predecessor about making enemies. One sign of this is his readiness to accuse the council of telling him to find people to do difficult and dangerous things without giving them the wherewithal to do them. He believes that when regional groups are strong, as the European Community supposedly is, they should work more consistently to bring about a peace. The UN peacekeeping operation is kept permanently and humiliatingly on the verge of bankruptcy. If the Security Council insists on sending a force into Bosnia without adequate political and military backing, the result on the ground could be a cruel farce.
The background to Mr Boutros Ghali's caution is that the newly assertive ambassadors at the Security Council, unlocked from American-Soviet rivalry, are trying to do something exciting, but they are doing it by stealth rather than accepting that there may have to be changes in approach. The argument for stealth is that pragmatism works; attempts to bring the changes into daylight could open a box of troubles. One of the troubles is the membership of the council itself: the five permanent members are the victors of the second world war. Japan, murmuring from the outside, wants to join the permanent five by the time the UN has its 50th anniversary in 1995.
More important, the new peacekeeping operations exploding around the council's head are no longer of the traditional kind and do not necessarily call for traditional answers, let alone traditional fund-raising. That the UN charter makes no mention of ""peacekeeping"" is handy since it lets members be inventive in stretching the ""international peace and security"" criterion. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was exceptional in being the type of conflict the charter writers had in mind. Most of the conflicts with which the UN is now involved are civil or ethnic--domestic matters into which the Security Council is not supposed to pry.
This raises all kinds of questions about the limits to national sovereignty. Most countries have something they would rather the world did not scrutinise: among the bigger countries, China has Tibet, India Kashmir, Britain Northern Ireland. The Latin American countries tend to be particularly twitchy; they reacted badly when the UN, without even pretending it had anything to do with collective security, helped Haiti run its election.
The sovereignty debate is just getting into its stride. As a logical extension of peacekeeping and peace-building, the UN is invited into country after country as the midwife of political transition: supervising elections (Namibia, Nicaragua and Angola, as well as Haiti); creating an impartial police force (El Salvador); rebuilding from scratch (Cambodia). Even when it is not invited, it sometimes gets its foot into an unwelcoming door through ""humanitarian"" relief.
This is what happened in northern Iraq. Relief was sent to the Kurds fleeing Saddam Hussein's revenge and 500 guards were sent to protect the relief-givers. The guards, at first mocked as glorified UN doormen (though most of them are ex-soldiers or ex-policemen), have become the eyes and ears of the Security Council, reporting on what the Iraqis are up to and contributing immeasurably to the safety of what is now, in effect, a UN protectorate.
The United Nations hopes to repeat the humanitarian-aid-plus-armed-escorts exercise in Somalia, where the need for relief is even more urgent than it was in Iraq; the UN calculates that 1-1/2m Somalis could die in the next few weeks if food and medicine do not get in. With the help of 470 locally hired mercenaries (not 10,000 as we incorrectly reported a couple of weeks ago), the UN is getting a little stuff in. But the UN would plainly prefer to be protected by its own men who would not, unlike those in Bosnia, have to be numerous or heavily armed.
The UN has had plenty of failures or near-failures. Even some successful operations are accounted failures. It has kept the peace for nearly 30 years in Cyprus. But the two sides are still far from political agreement, and the governments that contribute troops have received no payment from the organisation for the past ten years, so the secretary-general has been suggesting that the peacekeepers should be withdrawn.
PEACEKEEPING NEEDS HOUSEKEEPING
The UN faces internal organisational problems which may make such failures more likely. Council members respond to their people's desire ""to do something"" but shrink at the cost, which is higher than it used to be; the peacekeeping bill for the next 12 months is put at $2.7 billion.
The secretary-general still has work to do sorting out his own organisation, which is ponderous with bureaucracy and shot with pettiness--though he has got rid of many barons and done away, to the dismay of the developing world, with most of the UN's economic side. His secretariat, unlike any country's foreign ministry, is not split on a regional basis; there is no clear way in which he is fed information on what is happening. He depends on improvisation.
Last January a Security Council summit stage-managed by Britain asked Mr Boutros Ghali to report within six months on ways of improving peacekeeping, peace-making and the diplomatic prevention of conflicts. The secretary-general says that his report will be pragmatic, eschewing philosophy. This is commendable--new financing arrangements, for instance, are a priority--and it is in line with his members' approach. Yet the secretary-general, at one time in his long life, was an academic; and in these changing days a bit of revolutionary philosophy might not come amiss."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224171650/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/18?accountid=14657,"Since his election as Peru's president in 1990, Alberto Fujimori has often shown contempt for political rivals. But when he decided on April 5th simply to do away with them by abolishing his country's Congress and judiciary, he seems to have been remarkably naive about how this dictatorship would be seen abroad. Mr Fujimori's foreign critics are mainly worried that his actions may be imitated by his neighbours, reversing Latin America's transition to democratic government. Unlike Peru's weak and divided political parties, his critics abroad can bite back--and have done so by suspending aid and loan guarantees.
In an effort to placate them, Mr Fujimori made a hasty trip on May 17th and 18th to Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, where he told the annual meeting of the Organisation of American States that he cared about its criticisms of his actions. The OAS has acquired an unenviable reputation as a filing cabinet for Latin America's more intractable disputes. Its members are divided. Whereas Argentina and Venezuela want the organisation to take tough action where democracy is threatened, Mexico and others continue to see the OAS as a figleaf behind which the United States meddles in the internal affairs of its neighbours.
But Mr Fujimori chose the OAS as an audience to hear what may prove to be serious concessions to his democratic opponents. He promised elections within five months at most for a ""Democratic Constituent Congress"". Its functions will, apparently, be to make changes to Peru's 1979 constitution--set aside by the president--and to engage in some law-making and scrutiny of the executive. Previously, Mr Fujimori had merely offered two plebiscites in which he hoped to legitimise both his seizure of absolute power and a new constitution that was to be drafted by a committee named by himself. Only then was a new (presumably emasculated) Congress to be installed.
Many of the details in the new plan remain vague or ambiguous. In treating the OAS to a familiar diatribe against Peru's political parties, Mr Fujimori made it clear that his concessions were grudging. He remains inflexible in defending his self-generated coup, staged in the name of tougher action against the Maoist guerrillas of the Shining Path, the drug trade and corruption. He has sacked the president of the elections board, and appointed one of his own men to the post.
Whether free elections can be held in these conditions, with the president claiming 90% public support, is unclear. The opposition has welcomed an elected assembly, but remains unconvinced of Mr Fujimori's intentions. Maximo San Roman, installed last month as ""constitutional president"" by the dissolved Congress, has said that Mr Fujimori will begin to backslide as soon as the international pressure lets up.
WHY HE RELENTED
Last month Mr Fujimori had twice stonewalled an OAS mission sent to mediate between him and the opposition. Days before his trip to Nassau he refused to see an OAS human-rights delegation. He also denied its members access to Canto Grande prison, where police and troops were killing at least 36 Shining Path prisoners who resisted a government operation to recover control of their cell-blocks.
What persuaded Mr Fujimori to change his mind and fly to Nassau was the realisation that the government was going to run out of money. The finance minister, Carlos Bolona--whose decision to serve the dictatorship has surprised many--has spent the past year putting together a $1.4 billion package of loans from rich countries, aimed at restoring Peru's credit with the IMF and World Bank, ruptured under Mr Garcia. This is now unravelling. Acting outside the OAS, the United States and Germany suspended economic aid last month. The Americans have been putting pressure on Japan to do the same, while making it clear that they would not support loans to Peru by international bodies. Peru's $2 billion war chest of hard-currency reserves is enough to see it through this year, but little more.
Worried at the prospect of a siege economy, some of the businessmen who were Mr Fujimori's most vocal supporters have begun to have second thoughts. More than $200m of nervous money has fled Peru's banks since April 5th. The Shining Path, meanwhile, is busy demonstrating that it can bomb a dictatorship with as much impunity as a democracy. Whether Mr Fujimori has now retreated far enough from dictatorship to satisfy the United States and Europe is not immediately clear. But, by offering something, he has done the OAS a favour. Relieved of the burden of having to decide on sanctions, it was content to issue a bland call for ""effective progress"" towards the restoration of democracy."

The 1,300-year-old structure is in poor condition. Repairs, including a new layer of gold for the roof, are urgently needed after a harsh winter. The question of who should pay has ignited a bitter row between old Arab rivals.
Since 1952 Jordan's King Hussein, a member of the Hashemite family that claims direct descent from Muhammad, who is said to have ascended to heaven from the rock beneath the Dome, has been the custodian of East Jerusalem's Muslim holy places. Recently, UNESCO appealed for money to restore the Dome and al-Aqsa mosque, both of which sit on what Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and Jews Temple Mount. Since the Gulfwar the king has been strapped for cash, and he was slow to respond to the appeal.
Into the breach stepped Saudi Arabia with an offer to repair all the holy places, and also pay the salaries of their staff, who until now have got their money from Jordan's Ministry of Religious Endowments. King Fahd already has Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest places, under his guardianship and his offer was seen in Amman as a manoeuvre to supplant King Hussein and the Hashemites. The Jordanian king insisted that it was his right, not King Fahd's, to foot the repair bill. He is reported to have sold his British house to raise the needed money (an Amman-based committee has already collected $1.75m towards the $10m target).
The affair has awakened memories of ancient rivalries between Hashemites and Saudis. Ibn Saud, the kingdom's founder, drove King Hussein's grandfather, Abdullah, from Mecca and Medina in 1920. Are the Saudis now wanting to drive the Hashemites out of Jerusalem too?
The Saudi government claims its offer is not political but based on its global ""Islamic responsibility"". Yet the Saudis have been quick to highlight the support their generosity has won from Palestinians, not least the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat. He has thanked King Fahd effusively, though at the same time giving warning of a ""Zionist scheme"" to destroy the Muslim holy sites and build a new Jewish temple in their place. Mr Arafat is plainly anxious to repair the rift with Saudi Arabia that opened when the PLO supported Iraq in the Gulfwar. But backing the Saudis in this new quarrel could damage the PLO's relations with Jordan, and thus affect the Middle East peace talks at which the Palestinians and Jordanians form a joint delegation.
Israel is not directly involved in this inter-Arab row--although Teddy Kollek, the indomitable Jewish mayor of Jerusalem, has felt obliged to deny the allegation made by Palestinian clerics to visiting Egyptian engineers last month that construction near the adjacent Western (Wailing) Wall is damaging the mosques above. Five foreign firms have tendered for the contract to repair the mosques. Which one gets it will be decided next month, if the argument over who pays can be sorted out."

In much of Southern Africa the rains have failed. Civil wars have scythed down the economies of East Africa, and a drought could be on the way there too. Famine is possible. Why must it always be Africa that suffers the most?
Climate is part of the answer, but under-development matters more. The bulk of African food is produced by subsistence farmers, and a shortage of rainfall hits them much harder than commercial farmers with savings or other assets. The impact of unfortunate weather is multiplied by poor infrastructure: lack of dams and reservoirs means that rain, when it does fall, is often wasted, and poor roads make relief supplies hard to distribute.
But politicians can help to cause famines as well--or help to prevent them. This year's troubles in East and Southern Africa show how. The troubles in Somalia, southern Sudan, Ethiopia and among refugees in northern Kenya are clearly related to war and political instability. Those in Southern Africa are the product of a severe drought in a region that is more peaceful and better governed now than it has been in years.
Already an early response to the Southern African drought looks set to prevent famine in most countries. Botswana, alerted to the drought by efficient early-warning systems (harvest and weather reports, and information about prices and purchasing power) has been preparing to import grain since the first evidence of a long-term drought came in. So have Namibia and South Africa. Zimbabwe was slower to react. Legitimate caution, coupled with a reluctance to import grain while implementing economic reform, made the government take too long to respond.
Partly because of the early warning and, more importantly, because of good relations with the West, Southern Africa's cry for help has been swiftly answered. In a normal year Africa as a whole imports more than 6m tons of maize and grain. This year it will need much more. A good deal of this food, some purchased and some donated, is already on its way. In Namibia, Angola and Mozambique war has wrecked roads and railways, which makes grain more difficult to distribute. But the end of the fighting (except, occasionally, in Mozambique) means that relief workers can do their job in safety. Most of the relief supplies arrive in South Africa's ports, for shipment north across increasingly open borders. This would have been difficult or impossible before South Africa began its retreat from apartheid.
The world's response in the Horn of Africa may well be different. Here hunger is largely the product of man's folly, not simply the paucity of rain. The region's overlapping civil wars have turned untold numbers of farmers into refugees, which forces them to rely on foreign handouts and cuts local food production. More than 2m Ethiopians and the same number of Somalis have been displaced by civil war, along with 500,000 Sudanese. When foreigners try to distribute aid they are sometimes shot at by the people they are trying to help.
It will always be difficult for the world's donors to look at starving people and refuse to feed them. But some rich countries are beginning to argue that famines with political causes can only be halted with political solutions: the wars must stop. With attention shifting to the ex-communist world, compassion for Africa is weakening."

In Kano last October they fought over plans for an evangelist rally. In Bauchi in April Christians using a communal slaughterhouse to kill pigs were victims of a Muslim attack which turned into a fracas in which hundreds died. In Katsina that month a magazine article poking fun at Islam was enough for fundamentalists to set the town ablaze.
This week several hundred people may have died fighting in Kaduna over the siting of a marketplace in a provincial town, Zangon Kataf, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south-east of the city. The majority Hausa tribesmen interfered in the affair; the minority Kataf people began pulling up Hausa yams. Their fracas led to bloodshed, whereupon the Hausa and Kataf residents of Kaduna city set upon each other. Since May 19th troops have had to enforce a curfew to keep the two sides apart. In the south, meanwhile, Lagos has continued to smoulder after riots started by fuel shortages.
Taken together, the two recent incidents spell trouble for Nigeria's military rulers and their plan to hand over power to elected politicians next January. Tension of all kinds--political, ethnic and religious--is rising throughout the country, and the Armed Forces Ruling Council, chaired by the president, General Ibrahim Babangida, is getting increasingly jumpy.
On May 19th it introduced a draconian decree banning all political, religious and ethnic associations other than the two government-approved political parties. There is confusion about the extent of the ban, but not about the promised three-year jail sentences for those who break it. Its chief targets are regional leaders like those in the Northern Elders Committee based in Kano and the Middle Belt Forum in Jos, who have taken it upon themselves to screen the many presidential hopefuls. The junta thinks the candidates should be chosen by the two official parties and those who vote in the parties' presidential primaries in August.
On the day the ban was imposed, security agents backed by 200 armed police broke into the Lagos home of Bekoe Ransome-Kuti, the chairman of the Campaign for Democracy, a coalition of liberal and human-rights groups that call the army's plan for transition to democracy a sham. Police dragged him away in his pyjamas. His lawyer and other activists were arrested later the same day.
In the past Mr Ransome-Kuti had seemed untouchable. His older brother is a cabinet minister, his younger brother, Fela Kuti, is Nigeria's best known musician. His mistake this time was to let his organisation issue a communique, at the height of the Lagos unrest, accusing the president of leading the country to economic ruin. It called for General Babangida to resign and said that Nigeria should be run by a national conference, composed of different social and political leaders, pending new elections. That sort of frank talk can still be dangerous, even in a Nigeria heading for democracy."

The Germans claim it will help draw the French closer to NATO. The French hope it will become the centre of a European defence force distinct from NATO. The Americans fear the French may be getting their way, but have woken up to the danger too late to forestall it. They have anyway long supported the idea of a stronger European ""defence identity"" within NATO, making it more difficult to oppose a move that is being presented by the Germans as just that. The British, worried but also slow on the uptake like the Americans, are now touting a scheme for European defence co-operation in which the Franco-German corps could be subsumed and downgraded.
The new force is no more popular with the French and German military brass than the existing joint brigade (widely lampooned as ""a pricey language school"") from which it is to grow. But both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand, who were to announce the birth of the corps at their summit this week in La Rochelle, see overriding political reasons to press ahead. They want to show that the Franco-German ""special relationship"" still flourishes despite a lot of strains (see box on next page). They also want to take the lead after the Maastricht summit in December, which set the guidelines for a European defence policy to be operated through the Western European Union (WEU), a defence alliance of nine European countries.
At first glance the ""Eurocorps"", as it is called hopefully in Bonn and Paris, seems to achieve these aims. Open to other European states and due to reach full strength in 1995, it is supposed to have three broad tasks: first, to support NATO within the NATO area--thus, the Germans say, bringing France closer to the military structure of the alliance that it left under de Gaulle; second, to back the WEU in non-NATO areas of Europe; and third, to take part in peacekeeping or peace-restoring missions outside Europe, maybe (but not necessarily) under United Nations command.
A closer look reveals problems. For instance, the Franco-German accord makes clear that although the corps, with its own Strasbourg-based command, ""can"" be used to back NATO, its ""foremost"" role is in a WEU context. Could that mean a future clash of interests, even a possible loss to NATO of German (and later maybe other European) forces tied up in the corps? Perish the thought, say the Germans. Close consultations between NATO, WEU and Eurocorps commands will avert that danger. Besides, should a NATO emergency arise in which France did not want its Eurocorps forces involved, the German ones would be available in the way they always have been to NATO command.
The Americans have strong doubts but have only recently started putting them forcefully to the Germans. Assuming the French are aiming for a force and command wholly separate from NATO, the compromise wording of the agreement plays into French hands. The result could be to blurr the direct links that now exist between NATO command and the German forces to be involved in the Eurocorps. American officials say this sets a dangerous precedent. The anguished Germans are not quite being faced with the old threat of having to choose between ""Washington or Paris""--but the echoes are there.
The British think much like the Americans. But torn between a desire to stop any weakening of NATO and a desire to persist with the pro-Europe approach of John Major, they took ages to come up with a scheme aiming to combine both. As a result, the plan announced by Britain's new defence secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, on May 14th came too late to affect thinking in Bonn--let alone Paris--on setting up the corps.
Broadly, Britain wants WEU members to provide contingents from their own national forces (which could also be earmarked for NATO) as needed to cope with challenges affecting European interests where NATO is not involved. There would be no standing WEU forces or command structure to rival NATO. All WEU partners would be involved on an equal basis and any deployment would be authorised collectively by the WEU's council of ministers. That plan, if adopted, would soothe most American concerns.
It would also take care of fears that European defence could become a show dominated by France and Germany if based on the new corps, with other states' contingents joining it afterwards. Holland, for one, is known to have such fears and is therefore likely to back the British plan when it comes before the WEU ministerial meeting next month. How other countries, such as Italy and Spain, will decide remains unclear.
Apart from the NATO issue, the Franco-German corps also faces other difficulties concerning its proposed role outside Europe. Despite repeated bids to find a compromise when the agreement was being drawn up, the Germans stuck to their view that their forces cannot be used outside NATO without a constitutional change needing a two-thirds majority in parliament. The point is hotly disputed among lawyers. But politicians of all parties have insisted for so long that such a constitutional change is necessary that they would now find it nearly impossible to persuade the German public that after all it is not.
True, there is now wide parliamentary support for letting Germans take part in UN ""blue helmet"" peacekeeping forces. Some German military doctors have recently been sent to work under UN auspices in Cambodia, even without a constitutional change, and there has been no outcry. But according to the new defence minister, Volker Ruhe, it could be a decade before Germany is psychologically ready for a wider ""out of area"" military role.
Some government officials suggest participation in the Franco-German corps might help speed a change in German attitudes. That could be one reason why Mr Kohl, who repeatedly says Germany must shoulder more than ""blue helmet"" responsibility, has gone along with the scheme. But don't expect a quick change. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, a growing number of Germans see little point in the Bundeswehr and would much prefer the money spent on it to be diverted to paying for German unity. If, as is likely, Mr Ruhe recommends next month that Germany steps out of the expensive European Fighter Aircraft project, he can be sure of a big hand, despite complaints from German companies involved.
The number of conscientious objectors in Germany is at a post-war high (151,000 last year alone). Morale among officers and men has slumped, and lots of snags remain in knitting together the former East and West German armed forces. That is not a context in which early sympathy is likely for a wider German military role--whether in a Franco-German corps or anywhere else.
A FINAL FLING?
Forty years after France and Germany chose to bury their bellicose history in the European Coal and Steel Community, their alliance still dominates Europe's fitful moves towards a closer union. Their scheme for a European army corps has, once again, left Britain looking uncomfortable on the outside. As is the pattern with Franco-German initiatives, Britain had refused to take the corps seriously when the idea was hatched last October.
On his first day in office Klaus Kinkel, Germany's new foreign minister, reaffirmed German priorities by visiting Paris. Yet the Franco-German corps may turn out to be a final fling in a relationship which has always had its ups and downs. The chumminess of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Britain's prime minister, John Major, and the departure of the Francophile Hans-Dietrich Genscher from the German foreign office are not the only signs that change is in the air. Mr Kinkel is an Atlanticist who spoke out more firmly for the Americans during the Gulfwar than any other German politician. Volker Ruhe, the weighty new defence minister, leans to Britain rather than to France.
The essence of the Franco-German alliance has been an understanding that France and Germany share a common (if vague) vision of the Community's future and that, for all their differences, they must find compromises on big issues. Each has learned that the EC moves forward only when they act together. Thus Charles de Gaulle, 30 years ago:
You have only to look at a map to see the interdependence between Germany and France, on which depends any hope of uniting Europe in the political field as also in the defence or economic fields. So on that interdependence depends the destiny of Europe as a whole.
Successive generations of French and German leaders, since de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, have stuck to that line: Georges Pompidou and Willy Brandt; Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt; and now Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl, whose joint initiative has produced the joint corps. Britain has never managed to convert the tandem into a troika. France and Germany have suspected that Britain wants to turn the EC into a glorified free-trade zone, and worry about its frequent insistence on being a special case.
German diplomats still recall the performance of Harold Wilson, then British prime minister, in 1975, when Mr Giscard d'Estaing proposed an economic conference on the oil shock. Mr Wilson would not let the EC represent Britain, arguing that as an oil producer it had special interests and might join OPEC. Seventeen years later, many Germans point to the two British opt-outs in the Maastricht treaty--one on one monetary union, the other on social policy--as a sad sign that Britain still believes it is different.
But if the British can convince the Germans of their commitment to Europe, they will find ready collaborators on their many common interests. Unlike France, Britain and Germany want to speed up the enlargement of the community, first to the countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and later to the East Europeans. True, the German foreign ministry says that ""widening"" to include new members needs to be accompanied by a further dose of ""deepening"" (more moves towards federalism), and it argues that if Britain resists such moves it will be responsible for holding up enlargement. Yet many Germans are moving towards a more British approach. Mr Ruhe recently shocked his Christian Democratic colleagues by arguing that the EC should widen before it deepens.
And some Germans question the Franco-German commitment to European defence. ""Enlargement cannot be a priority at the same time as European defence,"" says Heidi Wieczorek-Zeul, the opposition Social Democrats' parliamentary spokeswoman on Europe. ""You can't take in neutrals like Sweden, Finland and Austria if you want a European military area. And we already have NATO.""
Germany's yawning budget deficit is pushing it closer to Britain--the other big net contributor to the EC budget. In the argument over plans put forward by Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, to increase the EC's budget by 21 billion ecus ($27 billion) over five years, Germany is proving as mean as Britain. Some of its officials argue that a shortage of cash will force Germany to abandon the goal of European defence and to rely on NATO options which, thanks to American involvement, are cheaper.
The budget deficit is tempering enthusiasm for further moves towards federalism. ""The Delors budget plan is logical if you want political union,"" says Renate Hellwig, a Christian Democrat who chairs the Bundestag's EC committee. ""But now we are asking, are we ready to pay for political union?""
The Franco-German alliance will endure while Mr Kohl stays in charge. But the French may find the next generation of German leaders tougher partners. The older lot, says one foreign-ministry official, ""allowed the French to manipulate our wish to be loved: when they asked if we were really loyal to the EC, we gave in."" He views the Ruhe-Kinkel generation as ""harder-nosed about German interests and less tied to angst-ridden alliances.""
If Mr Major plays his hand skilfully, he could open up the EC's pattern of alliances so that Germany teams up with Britain on some issues and with France on others. The big three already seem readier to work together: the planning staffs of their foreign ministries have met this year to discuss enlargement.
Yet so often, when the Franco-German alliance has seemed to be tottering, British hamfistedness has revived it. When de Gaulle assumed power in 1958, it was only Harold Macmillan's bid to undermine the European Economic Community, by creating EFTA, that reconciled the general to the Community. That allowed his partnership with Adenauer to flourish. Will Mr Major avoid Macmillan's mistake?"

That may be about to change. The war in Bosnia has doubled the number of refugees inside what was Yugoslavia. Tent cities are on their way.
In most wars refugees flee because of the fighting. In Croatia and Bosnia much of the fighting is designed to create refugees. Hitler talked of ""resettling"" Jews in his newly conquered eastern territories. In Bosnia and Croatia the phrase is ""ethnic cleansing"". It means that hundreds of thousands of people who happen to be of the wrong nationality in the wrong place (where their families have lived for centuries) must run for their lives.
How complacent were the generation of Europeans who grew up after the second world war thinking that such barbarous behaviour was something that happened nowadays only in unfortunate and far-away countries like Ethiopia and Bangladesh. Villages from which Serbs have fled in Croatia have been burned. Muslim villages in Serb areas of Bosnia are being burned to encourage their residents to leave. Croats in villages in Serbia are also being pressured to leave. Under the noses of United Nations peacekeepers, Croats in Serb-held territories of Croatia are being driven out. Serbs are fleeing towns in Bosnia where they are shot at, and towns in Croatia where they are frightened they will be. All sides have used massacre and mutilation to drive their messages home.
When Serbs, Croats and Muslims have all been tidied into neat ethnic compounds, then new borders can be drawn. Serbs and Croats in Bosnia will look to help from Serbia and Croatia. Or so ethnic zealots hope. It will not be that tidy. Muslims with no friendly ""mother state"" to look after them will be the big losers. So will hundreds of thousands of people who come from mixed families and in the past were happy just to be Yugoslavs.
According to the latest statistics from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 1.2m ""displaced"" people are inside the old Yugoslavia. The true figure is likely to be higher. The UNHCR numbers do not include hundreds of thousands of people who have escaped abroad, who have fled conscription or who are unregistered. Germany and Austria, which pressed their European partners to recognise Croatia and Bosnia, are now scared about the growing pressures to take in more refugees.
Until now the old Yugoslav republics were able to cope. They are being overwhelmed. UNHCR officials are planning for ever more desperate convoys. They are already thinking of the refugees to come when the war eventually shatters multi-ethnic Serbia itself. They are also reconciling themselves to the knowledge that a central part of the UN peace plan for Croatia looks perilously close to collapse. As Serb local authorities consolidate their grip on Serb territories in Croatia, few Croat refugees are likely to return home there. The message was underlined on May 16th, the day after the UN took control of Serb-held eastern Croatia: the (Croatian) Catholic church in the town of Dalj was bombed.
In Bosnia grim columns of cars and trucks trundle across the war-blighted republic. On May 19th a Swiss Red Cross official died after a missile hit the aid convoy he was bringing to besieged Sarajevo. ""They create the refugees and then the governments come crying to us,"" said a frustrated and exhausted UNHCR official. The UNHCR and the international Committee of the Red Cross have had lorries stolen and now people killed. No wonder they dream of the old days, of helping the needy in unfortunate and far-away countries like Ethiopia and Bangladesh."

A couple wake up in the morning. The wife switches on the light. It works. She rushes to turn on a tap. Water gushes out. ""Oh no!"" she yells to her husband, ""The communists are back in power.""
Yerevan is blacked out: there are no street lights. Restaurants and cinemas are shut. Outside the Opera House, men huddle together to discuss politics in the pitch dark. On April 24th, the day Armenians the world over pray for the victims of the Turkish massacres of 1915, Gerald Libaridian listened to the discussions. He is one of many diaspora Armenians now living in Yerevan. A historian, he advises the president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, on foreign affairs. ""The survival of Karabakh [the disputed Armenian-populated region in Azerbaijan] is the most important issue and it dominates diaspora thinking too. We cannot let 170,000 people be deported from their ancestral lands--another genocide, another deportation.""
Armenia's links with its diaspora have always been strong. Since the successful drive for independence from the Soviet Union, diaspora Armenians have started to play an increasingly prominent role in the government. The president (himself born in Aleppo in Syria) appointed Raffi Hovanissian, a lawyer from California's Central Valley, as foreign minister and Sebouh Tashjian also from California, as energy minister.
Theirs are the two most sensitive portfolios in the government. The foreign minister has to deal with relations with Azerbaijan, at a time when the Karabakh issue dominates Armenian politics. And with essential supplies (including energy) blockaded by the Azeris, the energy minister is struggling to find ways of keeping the economy going. Thanks to lack of supplies, rebuilding after the 1988 earthquake has stopped and thousands still live in lengths of oil pipes, disused containers and temporary huts.
Mr Tashjian, who has been energy minister since January, is making plans to avoid the disaster of last winter. In his vast chilly office overlooking the former Lenin Square, he describes the misery. ""Last winter was sub-human. We had indoor temperatures of 5degC. No gas for heating or cooking. Electricity was six hours on and six hours off. Water was cut off for a week at a time. In January and February industry practically shut down to save power for domestic use. Industrial production dropped to 15% of the previous year.""
Armenia cannot provide its own energy needs. In the past, 30% of its supplies came from hydro-power but 60% was oil from Russia and gas from Turkmenistan via Azerbaijan. In the past six months deliveries have been sporadic. The minister himself has to scrounge for petrol when he wants to travel. His driver will tour the suburbs for the odd truck parked on the road and buy whatever grade of petrol he finds to fill a jerry-can.
Ironically, back in 1988 Armenia was an exporter of nuclear-generated electricity to the rest of the Soviet Union. Armenia's sole nuclear plant was shut down three years ago after public protests about its safety. Mr Tashjian hopes to improve the safety of the plant and persuade the public to allow it to be reopened.
Alternative plans are under way. A new oil pipeline is being laid through Georgia, and a military bridge is being built across the Arax river to bring in oil from Iran. ""We told them we have no currency but we'll barter,"" says Mr Tashjian. Armenia hopes to borrow 100m ecus ($130m) form the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to complete electricity-generating projects, and it has applied for 25m ecus in grants from the European Community's aid funds for the former Soviet Union. If all else fails there are plans to store energy during the warm months to save 90 days-worth of fuel for the winter.
Despite its difficulties, Armenia is lucky in one sense. Unlike most other ex-Soviet republics, it can count on help from a well-connected diaspora (almost as many Armenians are reckoned to live outside the country as the 3.3m who live inside it). American and French accents are heard in the foreign ministry.
Mathew Ter-Manuelian, one of California's 350,000 Armenians, is a Fulbright scholar whose father helped set up the Armenian Assembly of America, part of the Armenian lobby in Washington. He is helping the foreign ministry's efforts to explain its view of the Karabakh conflict to America. Another American, now working as an aide to the foreign minister, has managed to merge his American and Armenian dreams: ""I've been thinking about independent Armenia for years. I walk past that sign, Foreign Ministry of Armenia, every morning, and it's a good feeling. It's like being in a car for the first time, and I'm in the front seat now."""
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224175819/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/25?accountid=14657,"In two weeks Azerbaijan has gone through more upheaval than most countries do in two decades. At home, a bewildering 24 hours on May 14th-15th produced first, a botched semi-coup which fleetingly restored the former Communist Party boss, Ayaz Mutalibov, to the presidency and then a popular uprising which swept him and his fellow-apparatchiks from power. At the same time the country faced military disaster, as the conflict with Armenia over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh escalated into something close to all-out war.
On May 9th the Armenians captured Shusha, the last remaining Azeri stronghold--which the Azerbaijani government had sworn to defend at any cost. After that the Armenians overran Lachin, a town just outside Karabakh, in a bid to establish a corridor between Karabakh and Armenia itself. This week the fighting spread to Nakhichevan, an enclave of Azerbaijani territory inside Armenia, the most sensitive area of the lot because Nakhichevan has a few miles of common frontier with Turkey (as well as a long stretch with Iran).
Many of the Armenian troops involved in these exploits are reported to be irregulars beyond the control of the government in Yerevan. But the capture of Lachin is anyway being represented by Armenian officials as a necessary ""humanitarian"" action, to enable food and medical supplies to reach the Armenians in Karabakh, who have been under a prolonged Azeri blockade. Predictably, the Azeris dismiss these arguments as specious. But in Baku last week's jubilation over the removal of the former communist bosses is giving way to despair over the prospect of war with an enemy that is better equipped and more eager to fight.
The Azerbaijani Popular Front, which is now in control in Baku, enjoys widespread support, but it is a loose coalition of sometimes disparate factions. Its leaders, many of them academics, lack experience in government and business. And despite its liberal image, the Front is more nationalistic than the ex-communists. Its rank-and-file vow they will fight the Armenians to the death--but with what weapons?
Isa Gambarov, a lawyer who emerged this week as interim head of state and president of the curious ""National Council"" that has replaced the communist-dominated parliament, is a respected figure with a good grasp of foreign affairs. But it is far from clear who will be running the Front in, say, 12 months' time. The official leader is a former history-professor, Abulfez Elcibey. He has done well to hold the diverse strands together, yet he hardly looks a dynamic national leader. He, rather than Mr Gambarov, will almost certainly be the Front's sole candidate in the presidential election scheduled for June 7th, and is favourite to win.
Before that, however, lots of things could happen to influence events in Azerbaijan, both on the battlefield and through diplomacy. The world has bigger problems on its plate than the future of Karabakh, but the Azeri-Armenian dispute is now on the agenda of several international organisations. More important, the pace of the Armenian offensive has alarmed both Turkey and Iran, always vying with each other for influence in Azerbaijan.
On May 19th the Iranian deputy foreign minister, Mahmoud Vaezi, denounced the latest Armenian operations as ""flagrant aggression"". Turkey issued its bluntest warning so far to the Armenians: if they did not drop their aggression, they would bear responsibility for the consequences. Turkey's president, Turgut Ozal, has urged his government to send troops to defend Nakhichevan, which many Turks regard as virtually an extension of Turkish territory (the 1921 Treaty of Kars gives Turkey a say in any change in the status of Nakhichevan.
Luckily for the Armenians, Turkish foreign policy is now controlled by the prime minister, Suleyman Demirel, who dislikes any idea of military adventures. Still, Nakhichevan is becoming the new flashpoint. With luck, the fighting there will peter out. If it escalates, even the ultra-cautious Mr Demirel may feel forced to take a stand."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144466/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/26?accountid=14657,"By the abysmal standards of past efforts at reform of Europe's common agricultural policy, the package put together by the Community's farm ministers on May 21st was radical. Farm prices may be cut by up to 29%; export subsidies will fall; for some crops, subsidies will be allocated according to less distorting mechanisms. For all that, this reform will not end Europe's overproduction of farm produce. Moreover, they abandon some of the more welcome features of the commission's own blueprint for reform, put forward by Ray MacSharry, the commissioner for agriculture.
The ministers, in conclave since May 18th, had still to agree upon some details of their reform when The Economist went to press. But its outline had been accepted by enough EC countries to secure a majority if it came to a vote. The centrepiece of the reform is the target price for cereals, the most widely traded farm commodity. This price is to fall by 29% to 110 ecus a tonne over the next three years. A smaller gap between the EC target price and prices on world markets will mean that, by 1997, export subsidies will have fallen too. This will meet one of the demands made by the Americans in their dispute with the EC over farm trade--a dispute that has brought talks on the Uruguay trade round to a standstill.
The deal on cereals opens the way to price cuts for other products too. It reduces the cost of feed grains for beef and dairy farmers, which will have a knock-on effect on the price of oil-seeds, another animal feed. To further discourage beef production, the EC will cut its purchases of beef from 750,000 tonnes a year to 350,000 tonnes by 1997. And support prices for beef will fall by 15% and butter by 7.5%.
Because of these price cuts, retail food prices will fall. Unfortunately, a new type of subsidy, introduced to compensate farmers for the price cuts, means that there will be no savings in the 35 billion ecus the Community spends on farmers each year. Indeed, costs are expected to go on rising until the new system is fully in place in 1997. This new subsidy, involving direct payments to cereals farmers from the EC budget, will be paid provided the farmers take at least 15% of their land out of production. Though the payments will create yet another piece of European farm bureaucracy, they at least have the merit of distorting markets less than a system that relies on prices alone.
The agreement is the culmination of talks begun a year ago on the basis of a far-reaching set of proposals from Mr MacSharry. The commission had said it had two aims: to reduce the high guaranteed prices that have generated huge surpluses and stretched the Community budget; and to modify the mechanism that gives the 20% of rich farmers 80% of the subsidy, so as to direct money towards small farmers.
In fact the vigour of Mr MacSharry's original plan has been sapped with each session of negotiations. For one thing Mr MacSharry's scheme to pay big farmers disproportionately less than small farmers has been scotched by British objections (even though the British complain about the size of the farm budget). For another, the new, lower price for cereals is higher than the one Mr MacSharry wanted and will remain well above world market prices.
Final agreement was held up by the demands of Italy, Spain and Greece for higher milk quotas. As all three have disregarded the quota system that was introduced in 1984, meeting their demands in full would have been as outrageous as rewarding sin.
The Community has insisted all along that the EC's talks on reform are separate from the Uruguay round, in which Americans and Europeans have been deadlocked over farm subsidies for five years. But, as the reform deal took shape on May 21st, Mr MacSharry said the Community was showing it was able to meet its commitments to the GATT round in full. ""It will be up to the others to match us,"" he said.
That is only half the story. Though the reform does cut domestic support and the value of export subsidies by enough to meet America's wishes, it will not curb production enough to meet America's demands over the volume of exports on each product. In addition, the new compensation payments to farmers may fall foul of GATT rules. In fact this reform does not do enough to restrain European cereals production. By the end of the century the familiar surpluses will return to the Community's landscape, unless some more radical plan is brought in."

Not only is the historical area of Macedonia now sliced between three countries (Bulgaria, Greece and the ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia). But Yugoslav Macedonia--itself an ethnic melange of assorted Slavs and Albanians--is the subject of an ugly mix-up between Greece and its European Community partners.
Most EC countries wanted to recognise the place as an independent country called Macedonia, and were stunned by the passion of Greek objections over the name. The Greeks worry deeply about what they see as a theft of their history and eventually (given past claims on the Greek province of Macedonia) of their territory. Their prime minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, demands EC solidarity: ""Europe has to choose now for one side or the other,"" he said last week.
Greece itself faces a choice over Europe. It has to decide whether it is prepared to take urgent measures to get its house in order in time for the EC's coming economic and monetary union, or else risk becoming a backwater. Few Greeks realise quite how much needs to be done and what is at stake. One of the few who does understand, the new economics minister, Stefanos Manos, is trying to shock the country--and cabinet colleagues--out of complacency by complaining that the past two years of conservative rule have been wasted.
He is exaggerating but only a bit. The conservatives inherited a mess--including a crippling public debt--from eight years of Socialist rule followed by a year of political limbo. The Mitsotakis government has made a start at restoring some order. It has brought the primary budget deficit (excluding interest payments on the debt) down from over 10% of GDP in 1989 to under 2% last year. Inflation is falling. The balance of payments has improved. And privatisation is at last under way, with the sale in March of 70% of the Heracles cement company for 124 billion drachmas ($660m).
However, the adjustment is not nearly fast enough. Interest payments on debt meant that the budget deficit was still a huge 14.1% of GDP last year. A primary budget surplus of 5-6% of GDP is reckoned to be needed to turn things round. That requires brutal surgery. So far, the government has barely brandished the knife.
It has failed to tackle tax fraud or to cut its own bloated bureaucracy. Stelios Argyros, the president of the Federation of Greek Industries, believes there is room to reduce state employment by 30-40%. He criticises the government for moving too slowly on privatisation and deregulation. Directly or indirectly, he says, the state controls 60-65% of the economy.
Mr Manos is hoping to find at least 100 billion drachmas in savings this year by, for example, forcing the bosses of state-owned companies to make big cuts in their wage bills. He is in a hurry to put together Greece's ""convergence plan"" setting out exactly how the country will bring its debt and deficit in line with the rules on EMU agreed upon at the EC's Maastricht summit. A tussle over responsibility for the convergence plan has not helped. Nor has the reluctance of other ministers to contemplate the necessary austerity. By failing to act as soon as they came to power, the conservatives have got themselves into a bind: either they avoid economic pain and miss the boat for EMU, or they inflict the pain and risk losing the election due in two years' time.
Andreas Papandreou, the leader of the opposition Socialist Party, says the unpopular government will anyway not last beyond September. That may be wishful thinking, but two threats do hang over Mr Mitsotakis, who has the slenderest of parliamentary majorities. One is the poor health of 85-year-old President Constantine Karamanlis. Were he to die the constitutional complications of picking a successor would almost certainly lead to an early general election.
The second threat is the Macedonian question (or the ""Skopje question"", as they insist on saying in Greece, Skopje being the capital of the unmentionable would-be state). All ideas for a compromise name--New Macedonia, the Macedonian Republic of Skopje--have been rejected by Mr Mitsotakis, who rules out anything with the word ""Macedonia"". Such is the strength of popular feeling that a defeat on the name argument could bring the government down.
Macedonia is a great distraction from decisions on the economy. Discussions with officials on the economy tend be interrupted by tirades on ""Skopje"". But Greece has no time to lose if it is to stand any chance of being ready for EMU. As Mr Manos puts it: ""We have to decide whether we want to keep pace with the Community or whether we stay in the Balkans."""

The Folketing (parliament) recently voted by 130 to 25 to ratify the treaty. But ordinary Danes will have their own chance to vote on the treaty in a referendum on June 2nd. Opinion polls show them equally divided for and against. The result will depend on the floating voters.
Suspicion of Maastricht stems from a vague but powerful feeling that the treaty compromises Denmark's independence. The nay-sayers are against what they see as centralisation of power in Brussels. They fear federalism and dislike the Community's undemocratic way of taking decisions. Many of the sceptics are supporters of the opposition Social Democratic Party (which supports the Maastricht treaty) who think the Danish welfare state will somehow be undermined through membership of a European Union.
The government's pro-Maastricht campaign has not been helped by rumours from the European Commission that it is drawing up plans to reduce the influence of the Community's small members. The rumours were denounced as lies by Jacques Delors, the commission's president, after the Danish foreign minister had threatened to veto his reappointment from January 1st next year unless he set Danish minds at rest. But suspicion remains strong, as it does over the Franco-German plan for a joint military force: some young voters say they worry that in future their children may be called up to fight for a European army.
However, there is hardly a pundit in Copenhagen who believes that in the end the Noes will win. Both in 1972, when there was a referendum on EC membership, and in 1986, in the vote to approve the Single European Act, opinion polls predicted a close race, yet the result was a comfortable Yes.
There is, however, a difference this time. In the past Danes saw the referendums as about economic, pocketbook issues. For 20 years Denmark's political leaders played down the Community's political aspects and ambitions. ""Union"" was a word long avoided in the Danish debate. The politicians, convinced since German unification that it is in Denmark's interest to draw its mighty neighbour firmly into a European political system, have changed their tune, but the voters, it seems, are still dancing to the former melody.
If the Danes say No on June 2nd, it will throw the Community into confusion. To become law, the treaty has to be ratified by all 12 members. The government says that a No will be the beginning of the end of Denmark's membership of the Community."

On May 18th Switzerland became the seventh aspirant to join the European Community when the government announced it was about to submit a formal application. Once the application is in, Switzerland will move up to fourth place in the queue, for the EC wants to let in its rich neighbours before anybody else. Too bad if you're Turkish, Cypriot or Maltese.
Yet the Swiss decision was greeted with more groans than cheers both within the EC and among the other rich applicants. For one thing, many EC officials see the arrival of neutral countries as creating problems for a Community committed to a common security policy and, ultimately, common defence. Switzerland is arch-neutral; it was last involved in a foreign war in 1515.
In addition, Eurocrats regard the Swiss as exasperating negotiators. It is the common view of EC negotiators and those from Switzerland's partners in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) that Swiss nitpicking delayed the conclusion of a new EC-EFTA treaty, which was finally signed on May 2nd. The other EFTA countries that have applied to join the Community--Austria, Sweden and Finland (with Norway expected to follow)--fear their target date for entry, 1995-96 will slip if the Swiss are also at the negotiating table.
The Community is expected to begin collective negotiations with the EFTA candidates early next year if (a big if) its internal debate on future spending has been concluded and if the European Commission has by then delivered its opinion on each application--a necessary prelude to entry talks. But even if entry is delayed a year or two, the EFTA countries will be luckier than Turkey, Cyprus and Malta, whose applications will go on gathering dust awhile. East Europeans have been discouraged even from applying for the moment, though one or two of them may before long embarrass the Community by deciding to do so.
The Swiss government has had its eye on membership of the Community for some time. Like the rest of EFTA, it believes the new treaty with the EC to create an integrated European Economic Area will still leave them as second-class Europeans. It was encouraged to speak out when it did by the outcome of a referendum the day before in which Swiss voters (narrowly) endorsed membership of the IMF. The voters will have the final say on EC membership too when the time comes. Convincing them that this is in their best interest will be far harder than making the case for joining the IMF."

Unlike many big commercial mistakes, the huge property built by Olympia & York in London's Docklands cannot just be written off as so much bad debt on the banks' books. It is set in eight square miles of concrete, and its future affects London's future.
Optimists see Olympia & York's cash crisis as part of the cycle of building in London that has been going on for centuries. In the 18th century the Adam brothers were nearly bankrupted by London's Adelphi Terrace. In the 19th century Thomas Cubitt went broke developing the two tallest privately owned buildings in the capital, on a site beside Hyde Park. Centre Point, the West End tower that symbolised the 1960s boom, sat empty for ten years before it filled up in the mid-1970s. Half the 10m square feet in Docklands may be empty, but time and transport will sort that out.
If the bankers (or a new owner) stump up the L400m ($730m) contribution that Olympia & York once agreed to put into the extension of the Jubilee Line tube, say these optimists--or if the government relents and pays the lot itself--then Olympia & York's vision of Docklands as an eastward extension of the City will be realised in a few years' time. Once the Jubilee Line is built, they argue, Docklands will have an airport with access to most of the important bits of Europe, a good fast road into the City, a speedy connection through the planned Stratford terminal to the Channel tunnel and good roads to the south and east.
Pessimists point out that a sixth of London's office space is empty, and that developments in the City and the West End are surrounded by the musty old buildings that the conservative British like. It is noticeable that all the early moves to Docklands have been by North American companies that do not share the British antipathy for newness, nor the financial establishment's distaste for London's East End. Space in Centre Point, in the bustling West End, recently changed hands for L12.50 a square foot (the space was at the end of its lease, but it was still a remarkably low rent); companies have little financial incentive to turn to Docklands.
The sceptics believe that Docklands lost its way in the mid-l980s. Before the arrival from Canada of the Reichmanns, Olympia & York's owning family, the area's ambitions did not stretch much beyond stationery companies and back-offices. According to this view, Docklands now needs to lower its ambitions. It could become a fine back-office location, a sort of Croydon-on-the-Water, charging half the price of City rents. Once the losses have been written off, it will fit comfortably into that slot. The only odd thing about it will be that some rather well-housed computer operators will be peering down at their bosses from 50 storeys up.
A more depressing view still is on offer, however, for those looking far into the future. The decades-old shift of people and businesses out of cities was masked by London's boom in the 1980s, but the trend continues. Docklands is looking to the long term for a revival in demand; but by the time the long term arrives, demand may have gone somewhere else.
America, whose social trends Britain often follows a decade or so later, has got interested in a phenomenon called Edge City, pinpointed by a book published earlier this year. Edge Cities are office, housing and retail developments that have sprung up on the outside of cities at convenient road junctions. Often they have no name: one of the biggest is 287/78 at the crossroads of those two interstate highways in New Jersey. Companies move to them because they are following workers out to the suburbs and are driven away from the cities by filth, congestion and violence.
Some of Britain's cities are not as unpleasant as some of America's, but they are expensive, crime-ridden and inconvenient enough to drive the better-off people away. London lost 218,000 people (3.2% of its population) through migration in the 1980s; Birmingham lost 113,000 (4.3%); Manchester lost 70,000 (2.7%).
Businesses have been moving, too, though scarce land and a tight planning system mean that they cannot ooze out of cities as they do in America. Britain's equivalent of America's sprawl is the business park--and it has been booming for a decade. According to Steven Bryant, a consultant at Applied Property Research, the space in business parks has grown in a decade from virtually nothing to 72m square feet--the size of Birmingham's and Bristol's city-centre office space put together.
Ten years ago the standard business park was a few sheds: now, it has landpark was a few sheds; now, it has landscaped greenery and a duck-filled lake. In the early 1980s high tech dominated the business parks. These days the trend is for company headquarters and financial backoffice functions to move to them just the kind of businesses that Docklands needs.
During the 1980s boom, companies were driven to business parks partly by city-centre rents. Will they rush back to the cities now that rents are falling? The stability of rents in the business parks suggests otherwise: people seem to like a short drive to work and a low-rise office among the trees. Rents peaked at around L32 a square foot two years ago; a couple of recently reported deals at Stockley Park near Heathrow and at Arlington Business Park near Reading were done for L30 and L32.
Joel Garreau, the author of ""Edge City"", is fairly optimistic about the future for the old American city centres: he thinks they may become cultural and tourist centres. There is talk of this for Docklands, with plans for theme parks and exhibition halls. Some suggest that expanding higher education may take up some of the space. Others think that, with the Daily Telegraph, News International and various advertising companies down there already, the place might specialise as a media ghetto. Still others hope that David Mellor, the minister for national heritage, may take an interest and use the area for one of the ""memorials"" to national culture that he plans. But perhaps Docklands has enough memorials to be going on with. The tourists have come already, outnumbering the workers, gazing up at Canary Wharf in awe at the scale of the architecture--and at the scale, dare one think it, of the crash?"

Had this happened any earlier, he (and they) could have faced prosecution under the Official Secrets Act, and even jail. In small ways, John Major's commitment to ending unnecessary Whitehall secrecy is working.
Neither document proved startling. But both, revealed by William Waldegrave as part of his ""open government"" brief, are interesting. The first gives details about all the cabinet's formal committees (see table).(Table omitted) Since virtually every important government decision is taken in a ministerial committee, these details are worth knowing. As for the ad-hoc committees summoned to discuss particular issues (there were 140 of those in the last parliament), the details of each will now be disclosed--though only after it has been disbanded.
Until Margaret Thatcher stopped the practice, the government used to say when cabinet committees met. The cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler, has clearly advised Mr Major not to return to this practice. Each committee's agenda is a hard thing to keep privy. If the timings of the committees were also known, outsiders--journalists, lobbyists, and above all MPs--would have a pretty good idea who would be deciding what, and when.
This would open the floodgates. Commons select committees could mount inquiries and publish reports to coincide with what was happening in the cabinet's committees--and could take evidence from the relevant ministers, and their advisers. MPs could request that such-and-such a decision should be taken to full cabinet, or ask why department X was not represented on committee Y. So Mr Major will try to hold the line, but he will face a constant political challenge. As the man who pledged more openness, he will have to resolve the awkwardness of being seen to kick against the consequences.
""Questions of Procedure for Ministers"", the second document, may help explain Mr Major's self-confidence. It is the basic rulebook given to all new ministers. It is both humdrum--a sensible guide to decision-making in a complex organisation--and draconian. Its basic message is that ministers are allowed to choose their own underpants in the morning, but that all subsequent decisions must be cleared by the prime minister or his minions--and often his press office, too.
It peels away any remaining notion that Mr Major is primus inter pares. ""Questions of Procedure"" lays down that he must be told about virtually any important happening, and that the Cabinet Office's permission must be sought for any significant act. Yet, pointing up the oddness of the British way of government, this vital document has no legal or constitutional basis.
""Questions of Procedure"" is interesting in other ways, too. It highlights the blurred and uneasy relationship between the executive--the queen's ministers, acting behind an opaque screen--and the legislature, which is open and well-understood. For instance, it states that all parliamentary private secretaries, the bag-carriers to real ministers, may sit on Commons select committees but ""should avoid associating themselves with recommendations critical of, or embarrassing to, the government"". They must be loyalists first, MPs second.
No man can serve two masters: and for ministers, it is Mr Major who is master, not parliament. But he is putting into parliament's hands a weapon which, one day, it may use against him."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224175836/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/33?accountid=14657,"Catch a British minister and his German counterpart chatting at a public function these days and you can hear roles being exquisitely reversed. The Briton boasts about falling inflation and a strike-free labour force. The German bemoans rising inflation and trade-union irresponsibility. But when the talk turns to training, the two revert to type. The German waxes lyrical about apprenticeship schemes and social partnerships. The British minister studies his shoes.
The Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) were created two years ago to make such conversations a little less embarrassing. The 82 TECs initially attracted applause for the boldness of their design--they are dominated by businessmen and charged with adapting national policies to local labour markets--and for the speed with which they got off the drawing board. But since the launch there have been persistent rumours of furious rows between businessmen and the government.
A recently leaked letter from Edward Roberts, chairmen of the G10, a pressure group of TEC leaders, to Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary, reveals how strained the relationship has become. Mr Roberts said the TECs could survive only if they were given more say in formulating government policy and more freedom to adapt national programmes to local circumstances. He complained about an excess of Whitehall bureaucracy and a lack of clear co-ordination across government. The TECs, he said, needed more stable policy-making--and, inevitably, more public money. ""I perceive that the TEC initiative is on a knife edge,"" he warned. ""Unless major reform of relationships is implemented, the thousands of businessmen [running the TECs] will simply walk away.""
So are the TECs on the verge of collapse? Not yet. Mr Roberts was simply doing what comes naturally to all government clients--talking up a crisis in order to squeeze more cash from his paymaster. For all their claims to originality, the TECs are also an old-fashioned lobbying group. A new employment secretary was too good a target to miss.
So far, few senior businessmen have resigned from TEC boards--partly because they want their knighthood's, and partly because they are anxious to stop the next economic upswing being hampered by skills shortages. In private, most businessmen remain strikingly enthusiastic about the theory (if not the practice) of TECs.
The government for its part would have to pay a heavy political price if it let the movement collapse. The Department of Employment has now handed over all its training activities (and 4,000 of its civil servants) to the TECs. Take the TECs away and the government would have no mechanism for providing training for school leavers and the unemployed.
But if the TECs are not on the verge of collapse they are certainly having a difficult time. Some are finding it hard to make ends meet. Most are demoralised. One reason for this is a culture clash between business and Whitehall. Businessmen want to get things done with the minimum of bureaucratic fuss. Whitehall (and particularly the Treasury) refuses to spend public money without attaching strings and demanding accountability. Since two government schemes--Employment Training and Youth Training--account for more than 90% of TEC spending, it is unlikely that the TEC chairmen will be given a free hand.
The other reason is the recession. The TECs were dreamed up when unemployment was falling and skills shortages mounting. Since then, unemployment has risen relentlessly, to nearly 2.7m. And the government has spent less on training as expenditure on social security has soared. Businessmen who expected to be delivering high-quality training to aspiring youngsters now find themselves administering a chunk of the welfare state--and administering it according to the demanding rules of Whitehall.
Leaked letters and hasty meetings between frustrated businessmen and government ministers are one way of adjusting the flow of cash into the TECs. But the Labour Party had a neater solution to the problem of paying for training: allow the TECs to impose a levy on firms which spend less than 0.5% of their payroll on training. John Major has stolen several Labour policies since winning the election. Why not add this one to the list?"

For many football fans, though, more may mean less. British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), a satellite-television consortium, has, barring last-minute upsets, bought exclusive rights to live coverage of the top league games. Around 13% of households get BSkyB's programmes--either via a satellite dish or, in a minority of cases, via a cable. Football fans without BSkyB may now have to fork out L270 ($494) for a satellite dish, or content themselves with recorded highlights and the odd match in the FA Cup on the BBC.
The deal proposed by BSkyB and the BBC would vastly increase the amount of money that broadcasters will pay to cover football. The newly formed Premier League of top clubs would receive L304m ($560m) over five years, compared with the L44m paid by ITV to the old Football League over the past four years. Because the BBC is very much the junior partner in the new deal--it would pay just L4.5m a year--all the live games (and probably most of the best, ones) would be shown on satellite television.
Cornering the market in the most tempting sporting events makes a lot of sense for BSkyB. When, earlier this year, it bought exclusive rights to cricket's world cup, sales of satellite dishes soared to over 100,000 a month. Exclusive rights to the top football games would lead to even faster growth. BSkyB, once regarded as a dead weight which might sink the entire media empire of Rupert Murdoch, might emerge as a future flagship.
Mr Murdoch's popular tabloid, the Sun, assured its readers that the new deal means that ""the fans will be the big winners."" Others are more suspicious. Although the number of people with cable or satellite television would certainly grow, so would the costs of watching. BSkyB's sports channel may start charging a subscription fee next season. The next development, already being considered by the channel, might be to charge extra fees for particularly attractive games, through pay-per-view technology.
Avid fans of televised football could then find themselves paying four times: first a government licence fee of L80, to own a television; then more money to get satellite or cable installed; then a monthly subscription; and then one-off charges for the best games. Big championship boxing matches in America are now often on pay-per-view, and the fee for the cable company to unscramble the signal to your home can be as high as $35.
Conservative members of Parliament are already expecting trouble. Cable television is already a big political issue in the United States and, in several respects, the position in Britain would be even more invidious. British viewers, unlike Americans, already pay an annual licence fee to get the terrestrial channels. Over 50% of Americans get cable, but fewer than 15% of Britons receive satellite television. And the sports authorities in the United States--even given the high penetration of cable--have still ensured that the most popular sports are accessible to all. Much more live American football is shown on network television than on cable.
But things could still go wrong for Britain's satellite moguls. On May 20th accusations surfaced that BSkyB had been allowed to lift its bid at the last minute, without ITV being given a chance to respond. The role of Alan Sugar, who as chairman of Tottenham Hotspur argued strongly for the BSkyB deal, is particularly controversial. As Mr Sugar himself reminded his fellow club chairmen, he is also the head of Amstrad Consumer Electronics, the chief manufacturer of satellite dishes. ITV executives hope to capitalise on lurking disquiet about the deal to get the whole matter reopened."

Westminster remains sovereign. Nothing has changed. England stands where it always did.
And then, a tiresome people will, a Tory backbencher and Brussels-baiter, Sir Teddy Taylor, asked him what he would do if Britain were taken to the European Court of Justice for retaining immigration checks at ports--and lost. Oh, said the prime minister, Britain would argue its case forcibly. Up jumped Peter Shore, a Labour pendant to Sir Teddy Taylor. No, said he, the prime minister had not answered the question. What would he do if the court ruled against him? The blunt and honest answer from Mr Major would have been: ""Her Majesty's Government would immediately cave in."" For some reason, he did not say this.
The smooth surface had, however, been punctured. Sir Russell Johnston, a Liberal Democrat, who also intervened in Mr Major's speech, used to say he looked forward to the day when Westminster had no higher status than Ohio's State House. That day is rolling nearer, even if it is still considered unacceptably impolite to mention the fact in the Commons itself. Compared with the importance of their European policy, most of the rest of what Mr Major and his ministers do is mere administration.
In a sense, Mr Major is against politics, and in favour of mere administration. In what sense? For the average English voter, politics is a dirty word. It means fuss, and being interfered with and lied to. The Tory triumph in England was a triumph of ""leave us alone"" versus fuss. Mr Major is political to his marrow when it comes to outmanoeuvring Labour or maximising his internal position in the party. But in the sense that the privacy-loving, sceptical English voter is against politics, so is he.
The new government programme consists of unfinished business from the Thatcher era--the privatisations, the health and education reforms. And the rest? Smoothing of rough edges there. A bit of modernising here. Above all, nothing to stir or alarm the people.
His European policy is a case in point. Mr Major's victory at Maastricht was to have got the EC to put off decisions (on the single currency) and to complicate Europe's decision-making structure, so blurring and disguising the big picture. All that is soothing at home. But, a committed free-trader, Mr Major accepts the supranational logic.
Nor is this a battle between ""Thatcherites"" and the new regime. Take the recently published thoughts from two of Margaret Thatcher's disciples--men who both served in her Downing Street policy unit in the 1980s. Ferdinand Mount says in his new book, ""The British Constitution Now"": ""It is hard to see how cunning and energetic national vested interests can be persuaded to accept foreign competition, without some supranational authority to give legal effect to the free-trade principles."" And this, he concedes, means lost sovereignty. David Willetts, the new Tory member of Parliament for Havant, calmly notes in his recent book ""Modern Conservatism"" that the mutual recognition of national standards ""is a massive erosion of the traditional prerogatives of the nation-state"".
Neither man is a pure Thatcherite any more; and both demonstrate some interesting things that are happening to the party under the surface of no-fuss Majorism. Until a few years ago, Mr Willetts was considered a bit of a wild-eyed thinker, a purveyor of mildly nutty free-market ideas. But his radicalism has become the conventional wisdom. He has come in from the think-tanks and seeks to reconcile Thatcherite radicalism with the grand Tory tradition. Mr Willetts is not yet fat, or bald. But he has quickly become a solid citizen on the Tory benches. He went to sleep one evening a radical, and has woken up a Conservative.
It would be a foolish observer who deduced that this was the end of the matter. The bundle of ideas called Butskellism took about 30 years to jump from the margins of Keynesian pamphlets to power, and then to be discredited. On that basis, today's Conservative consensus might be overthrown by around 2010. Mr Mount who, like Mr Willetts, goes along with some European integration, indicates how that overthrow might come about. He has been dabbling with constitutional reform (and has been exceedingly impertinent about Bagehot's great-great grandfather, Walter, in the process). And the constitution is Mr Major's weak point.
Here again, it is necessary to return to this week's European debate. Mr Major's case for Europe is essentially a free-trade one. He stresses the importance of a genuine single market, in which the people of Europe (rather than their governments) can become an ""ever-closer union"". He is for economics and modernity; against politics and sentiment.
The trouble is that his modernising stance is one-legged, for he claims to be a parliamentary absolutist. The political power of the European Community is not something that can be reined in by a self-deluding parliament that cackles on about its sovereignty, like some old dear remembering her lost beauty. Until ministers start to speak the truth about what is happening to Westminster, the chance of developing the British end of a European-wide democracy is slim.
Similarly, when Mr Major is asked by disruptive Scottish MPs why the principle of subsidiarity applies to Britain, but not inside Britain, he brushes them aside with a crude assertion that he is ""for the Union"". But his own logic is against him. Maastricht meant, he said, that ""we cannot be forced into policies we do not approve of."" His uneasy response over the immigration question shows that this is not strictly true. For a majority of Scottish voters, it is not true at all.
The early days of a new parliament, straight after a famous victory, may seem an odd time to ask Conservatives to contemplate a philosophical dilemma. But it is a real one, and the Maastricht debate highlights it. For how long can you preach modernity and liberalism while perched on top of a centralised but decaying legislature? At some point, the democratic strains in the system will start to destroy the very contentment culture Mr Major is trying to create. When that day comes, real politics will be back."

The outcome could have been so much worse. The deal gave their workers a pay rise of 5.8% this year and a 3.4% rise in 1993 with an hour's cut in the working week. But their relief is likely to be short-lived. The German car industry is heading for trouble--and it knows it.
""No matter how we look at it, there is no getting around the fact that we produce too expensively,"" says Erika Emmerich, president of VDA, the association of German car makers. Belatedly, German car firms are admitting that they have been slow to respond to new Japanese competition at the luxury end of the car market and, in mass markets, to fiercer competition from all sides. They are starting to move some production out of Germany--a strategy long considered taboo. They are also scrambling to learn many of the new manufacturing techniques pioneered by Japanese rivals, which have already swept through the American car industry over the past few years.
Imitating the Japanese will be an especially bitter surrender for the German car industry. Its managers have long scorned Japanese rivals as manufacturers of plebeian vehicles aimed at customers lacking the discrimination, or cash, for superior German models. With their legendary reputation for engineering excellence and some of the poshest brand names in the business, German car makers have managed to charge premium prices for their cars and to escape, until recently, the full brunt of Japanese competition.
But having established their own reputation for high quality by producing small and medium-sized cars, Japanese car makers have invaded the market for luxury and high-performance cars where German producers excelled. Worse, the Germans' past success at charging premium prices let them prosper despite their own rising costs, and so encouraged them to ignore for too long the manufacturing revolution sparked by the innovations in Japanese factories.
There is a huge difference between the way Japanese and German companies make cars. This was vividly illustrated in ""The Machine that Changed the World"", a five-year study of the world car industry by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It found that a German luxury-car plant required up to four times as many man-hours as a Japanese factory to build a similar car.
The MIT team coined the term ""lean manufacturing"" to describe how the Japanese used flexible teams of workers to eliminate waste and improve quality. Instead of stopping the production line to deal with defects when they occur, as the Japanese do, German factories use large repair areas at the end of the production line. At one German plant the MIT team said ""armies of technicians in white laboratory jackets laboured to bring the finished vehicles up to the company's fabled quality standards.""
In America and elsewhere in Europe, car companies wounded by the Japanese have already begun to cut costs sharply and to introduce Japanese methods of production. But a boom last year in their domestic market indulged the German car makers in their lack of interest. Gemman car sales rose strongly when millions of consumers in eastern Germany junked their Trabants and Wartburgs. New car sales in Germany increased by more than 13% to 4.2m in 1991 and left most German producers looking fairly healthy (see table on next page).(Table omitted)
Now the German firms are rightly worried. Edzard Reuter, boss of Daimler Benz, reckons that Mercedes-Benz, his company's car-making subsidiary, needs to shed 20,000 out of 237,000 jobs over the next three or four years. BMW plans to reduce its workforce of 74,000 by about 3,000 this year. Volkswagen (VW), Europe's biggest car producer, also plans to cut jobs but is coy about the numbers. Tough changes are expected when Ferdinand Piech, grandson of Ferdinand Porsche who designed the ever-popular VW Beetle (see box on next page), takes over as chairman from Carl Hahn in January.
Mr Piech is currently chairman of Audi, the division which makes VW's top-of-the-line models. Under his stewardship Audi is seaching for lower-cost assembly sites in Mexico and America. Mercedes began small-scale assembly of some cars in Mexico last year and BMW is also considering opening an American plant. VW has a head start in moving production out of Germany. It already makes cars in Mexico for the American market and owns SEAT, a Spanish car maker, as well as a controlling stake in Czechoslovakia's Skoda. VW is also building a new car plant at Mosel, in eastern Germany. Germany.
VW admits that low wage rates will be only a temporary feature of the Mosel factory. Eastern pay rates in the engineering industry are planned to catch up with those in western Gemmany by 1996 and may do so much sooner. But a more durable advantage could be that eastern workers are less unionised; they may be more willing to learn new production methods.
Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors (GM), is also hoping that this will be so. Opel is investing about DM1 billion ($630m) in building a new car plant at Eisenach, 10km inside the old border with eastern Germany. It will use just 2,000 employees working in three shifts to produce 150,000 cars a year. That would be half as many cars as it makes every year at its main plant at Russelsheim, where today's 18,000-strong workforce is expected to shrink by about 6,000 over the next five years. The company has calculated that, even without this month's wage increase, it costs DM750 more to produce its medium-sized Vectra model in Russelsheim than it does to make the same car at GM's British factory.
Opel has a curious advantage over other German car makers: its American parent was brought to its knees by Japanese competition. That unhappy experience may enable Opel to teach the rest of the German car industry lean manufacturing techniques. Dan Jones, a professor of motor-industry management at Britain's Cardiff Business School and a contributor to the MIT report, points out that the company can draw on everything GM has learnt, slowly and painfully, about Japanese methods.
Some of the staff at Eisenach have come from New United Motor Manufacturing, GM'S joint-venture with Toyota in California, and from another joint-venture with Suzuki in Canada. Opel has had plenty of requests from other Gemman car companies to visit Eisenach. Unsurprisingly, the firm has refused. It says it will keep Eisenach's doors firmly closed until long after it begins production this autumn."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224155388/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/37?accountid=14657,"Many big-city commuters feel that they spend much of their lives in their cars. Soon there may be little reason ever to spend time anywhere else. After two years of trial and error, Japanese firms have just launched a flurry of fancy new electronic gizmos, which not only tell a motorist where he is and help him plan his route, but also offer weather information, traffic patterns, quizzes, horoscopes, karaoke and television. With other consumer-electronics markets flat and fiercely contested, many Japanese firms are hoping that so-called ""in-car navigation"" systems long mooted but so far appealing only to aficionados, are about to become a mass-market item, especially if they sport lots of entertainment features as well.
Prices are tumbling but are still far from low. Pioneer, the leading supplier of in-car navigation equipment in Japan, has managed to sell only 20,000 units over the past two years. The simpler of its two latest models sells for Y230,000 ($1,780). Digital maps--sold separately as CDs or wallet-sized electronic cards--cost up to Y16,000 each. A dozen or so digital maps are needed to cover all of Japan.
Japanese manufacturers expect to sell some 110,000 navigation machines in Japan this year. After that, as prices come down, sales are expected to soar. Electronics companies are predicting that more than 1.5m machines will be sold annually in Japan by 1995. Forecasts for sales in America are even more bullish.
The car-navigation market received a powerful boost last year from the Gulfwar, which put the idea of satellite-guided navigation on front pages around the world. Allied troops were able to pick their way across a trackless desert with impressive accuracy thanks to the Pentagon's Navstar global-positioning system (GPS). Even before the war, the American government had let civilians use data from the $10 billion GPS free of charge. The 18 GPS satellites now in orbit (a total of 24 will be up by 1993) can tell private users their position anywhere on the globe to within 30 metres. The military can decode encrypted signals also sent by the satellite for even greater accuracy.
The first to take commercial advantage of the GPS data were Rockwell, the defence contractor that supplied many of GPS's satellites, and Trimble Navigation, a small Californian firm. Trimble now expects its annual sales of navigation equipment to be $4 billion by 1995, up from a mere $40m in 1989. Pioneer, which introduced the first in-car navigation system using GPS in 1990, has worked closely with Trimble. The two companies have a joint venture in Japan which is about to launch an advanced GPS-based system. It allows fleet operators to track their vehicles and communicate with them via two-way radio and cellular telephones.
Other companies are also jumping into the market. Sony has been selling a portable GPS gadget called Pyxis for hikers and yachtsmen since August 1991. Next month it will launch a Y285,000 version that can be plugged into a car's cigarette lighter. Toshiba has been selling a GPS navigator to motorists since March. Sanyo has launched a similar product and Matsushita is working on a much cheaper model.
This spate of new products from consumer-electronics companies seems to have left Japanese car makers far behind. But they could get a second chance. Car makers such as Nissan and Honda have been working on inertial navigation systems based on small gyroscopes, sometimes combined with networks of roadside beacons, rather than on satellite signals. Eventually such systems may prevail. Japanese engineers point out that the 30-metre accuracy offered by GPS is available only at the whim of the Pentagon. Equipment makers know that, once they grow accustomed to the idea of electronic navigation, motorists will want to pinpoint their locations to ten metres or less--the difference between identifying a specific road crossing and an entire city block on a video map. Gyroscope-based systems can offer such accuracy--though so can GPS, if the satellite signals are supplemented by broadcasts from local beacons.
Nevertheless electronics firms, and their suppliers, may beat the car makers to this market too. A new generation of miniature gyroscopes being developed to take the ""shakes"" out of lightweight video cameras could be adapted for use in cars. In Japan, Murata Manufacturing and Hitachi Cable are already working on such machines."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144613/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/38?accountid=14657,"Corporate America's favourite excuse for investing less than Japanese industry and, as a result, losing industrial competitiveness is that capital (whether in the form of debt or equity) is dearer in America than in Japan. Even if this was once true, the handicap has now disappeared. A recent study by Richard Mattione, an economist with J.P. Morgan, an American bank, concludes that, for the first time in years, American firms can raise capital more cheaply than their Japanese rivals.
Americans cite various reasons for the access Japanese firms have enjoyed to cheaper capital: the Japanese government keeps interest rates artificially low; Japanese manufacturers get preferential treatment from banks thanks to their cosy cross-shareholdings; and Japanese financial markets are less short-sighted than Wall Street.
A lower cost of capital has, it is argued, allowed Japan to invest in projects that would be unprofitable in America. It would also explain Japanese companies' much-praised willingness to invest for the long term. Future profits are discounted less heavily when the cost of capital is lower, which means they can be reaped further into the future and still offset the initial project costs.
Defining the cost of capital, let alone measuring it, is tricky. The usual method is to take the average of the cost of debt and the cost of equity, weighted according to a country's debt-equity ratio. A common mistake is to compare nominal interest rates in America with those in Japan, and to conclude that the cost of debt is lower in Japan. America's nominal interest rates were significantly higher than Japan's throughout the 1980s. But it is real (adjusted for inflation), after-tax interest rates that matter. Judged on this basis, there is hardly any gap between American and Japanese rates. Real post-tax interest rates on bank loans in America were only half a percentage point higher on average than in Japan in the second half of the 1980s (see chart 1); (chart 1 omitted) the rate on bonds was only 0.2 points higher.
This year the gap has widened; real interest rates on American bonds are now about two percentage points higher than Japanese yields. Whereas Japan's real yields have stayed roughly the same. America's have risen--because nominal interest rates stayed high as inflation fell. The reason may be that investors remain worried about the longer-term outlook for American inflation.
Measures of the cost of equity are more controversial. Unlike lenders, equity investors do not receive a fixed stream of payments; they get (less predictable) dividends. So the cost of equity is usually derived from the price-earnings ratio. The higher the ratio, the lower the cost of capital--ie, the less a firm's existing shareholders have to dilute their ownership, and so their claim on future incomes, to raise a given amount of new money.
Japan's p/e ratio has been higher than America's throughout the past two decades, rising to four times that of Wall Street in 1989. This suggests that Japanese firms enjoy vastly cheaper equity finance. But p/e ratios need to be adjusted for differences in accounting, taxation and the large cross-holdings of Japanese companies. After these adjustments, Mr Mattione finds that Japan's cost of equity was actually higher than America's in the 1970s; only after Japanese share prices began to soar in 1984 did it become noticeably lower (see chart 2).(Chart 2 omitted)
In 1987-1989 equity finance in Japan was exceptionally cheap, costing on average four percentage points less than in America. But since December 1989 the Tokyo market has fallen by more than half, while Wall Street has gained a quarter. As a result, calculates Mr Mattione, equity finance is again more expensive in Japan than in America. Even using prospective, rather than historic, profits to calculate p/e ratios (to allow for the fact that American profits are currently at a trough, while Japan's have only just peaked), corporate America still has a clear advantage.
Taking a weighted average of debt and equity, Mr Mattione says that Japanese firms did enjoy a large, though temporary, cost-of-capital advantage in the late 1980s, but that this has since vanished. In the first quarter of this year the real weighted-average cost of capital was about half a percentage point lower in America than in Japan.
If Mr Mattione's calculations are correct, then apart from the exceptional period of the late 1980s, and the early 1970s when Japanese real interest rates were strongly negative, the unfair-cost-of-capital argument employed by American businessmen is much exaggerated.
Carl Kester and Timothy Luehrman, two economists at Harvard Business School, go even further. They argue that American firms have never faced a signficantly higher average cost of capital than their Japanese competitors. Most of the studies that found the average cost of capital in America to be higher than in Japan failed, they say, to take account of differences in the mix of companies. As a result these studies ignored differences in the riskiness of borrowers. Messrs Kester and Luehrman argue that, if you treat the cost of capital as the sum of the interest rate on a ""risk-free"" security and a premium to compensate investors for risk, then the cost of capital for comparable firms of similar risk was the same in America and Japan during the 1980s. This is, as they point out, what you would expect to find if the global market for capital were fully integrated.
There is an even simpler test. The American subsidiaries of Japanese firms usually choose to raise finance in the American domestic market. Would they do that if there was such a huge cost-of-capital advantage back in Japan?"
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224147340/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/39?accountid=14657,"The long-awaited shake-up of Europe's aerospace industry has begun. Leading the way is Deutsche Aerospace, a company cobbled together from a group of ailing aircraft makers in the late 1980s by Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest manufacturer. On May 18th Deutsche Aerospace said that, along with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, it was negotiating to take control of Fokker, a Dutch aircraft maker. If the deal goes ahead, the new group could quickly become Europe's second aircraft-making consortium after Airbus Industrie. If it flounders, Germany's sputtering ambitions in aerospace will receive another big blow.
Most of Europe's aircraft makers want to build a new generation of small jet airliners for use on short-haul routes, but they lack the money to do so. So they are keen to spread the risks (and any available government subsidies) around. Deutsche Aerospace has been planning a new consortium called Regioliner. Together with Aerospatiale and Alenia, it aims to produce a 120-seater jet in 1996. This would cost about $2.5 billion to put into production and all three firms have been hoping for government cash to help it get off the ground.
Deutsche Aerospace and Aerospatiale are already partners in Airbus Industrie, which at great expense to European taxpayers has established itself as the world's second-biggest aircraft maker with a successful range of large jets. Although Airbus has also been planning to make a small jet, it is not complaining too loudly about two of its own partners teaming up in a competing consortium. The reason is that Airbus needs German and French financial support to launch a giant aircraft capable of carrying 600 to 1,000 passengers--the next move in its running battle with America's Boeing, its main rival.
Fokker has been a bigger obstacle than Airbus to Deutsche Aerospace's plans. Hence the German company's interest in gaining control of the Dutch firm. Fokker already makes a successful 100-seat jet, which it planned to alter to produce an entire family of small jets. This would be much cheaper than building a new jet from scratch, as Deutsche Aerospace wanted to do. If the deal goes ahead, Regioliner will be shelved. Deutsche Aerospace already builds the fuselage for Fokker's jet, but it wants to be the boss, not just a supplier. It proposes to take a 26% stake in Fokker, while the French and Italian companies take 12.5% each. The deal could leave British Aerospace out in the cold. It wants to build a competing 130-seat jet, but has been unable to find partners.
All this could change. While it tries to assemble a consortium to build civilian jets, Deutsche Aerospace may be told by the German government to abandon another consortium to build Europe's next military jet, the so-called European Fighter Aircraft. Germany's defence minister, it has been widely reported, wants to pull out of the project. Deutsche Aerospace has been developing the fighter with aircraft firms in Britain, Italy and Spain. A formal decision is expected by June 1st. If Germany does quit, Deutsche Aerospace fears that it will be shut out of the fighter-aircraft market forever.
As if that prospect were not bad enough, Deutsche Aerospace has also failed to lure BMW, the Munich-based car maker, away from a joint venture it is setting up with Britain's Rolls-Royce to make jet engines for any new small airliners that get airborne. Deutsche Aerospace had offered BMW a 25% stake in its own aircraft-engine subsidiary. But, perhaps because Daimler-Benz, maker of Mercedes, is also a fierce rival in the car market, BMW demurred.
Deutsche Aerospace wants to complete a deal with Fokker before a planned sale of new shares by Fokker goes ahead in July. If this deal also unravels, Daimler-Benz's grand scheme to create an aerospace giant may be doomed."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224147407/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/40?accountid=14657,"A year ago Hanson, Britain's biggest conglomerate, took a 2.8% stake in ICI, its biggest manufacturer, in what everyone assumed was a prelude to a bid. Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's combative chairman and chief executive, was enraged. A fierce public-relations war ensued. ICI won. Hanson never bid and, on May 8th, quietly sold its stake for a modest profit. Even ICI's many critics concede that the firm responded well to the threat of takeover, accelerating a cost-cutting and restructuring programme it had announced early in 1991 before Hanson bought its stake. But already the firm seems to be drifting again, without a clear plan for expanding the higher-margin businesses on which it has concentrated and with rumours growing of a looming succession battle.
Since Hanson acquired its stake, ICI has sold L565m-worth of businesses and cut its workforce by 15,600 to 120,000. It plans to sell its fibres business, once one of its biggest subsidiaries, to Du Pont in exchange for L250m ($430m) and Du Pont's acrylics plants. The deal will make ICI the world's largest producer of acrylics, a common ingredient in many sinks, baths and paints. The company is also looking for buyers for its low-margin European plastics business and, to cut costs and impose tighter management controls, is closing its European headquarters in Brussels.
The disposals have edged the company closer to its goal of relying on higher-margin products. When Sir Denys took over in 1987, 18% of ICI's sales came from the firm's bioscience group, which includes drug and farm-chemical businesses in which the company places its highest hopes. By 1991 bioscience's share of sales had risen to 24%. Drugs accounted for half of ICI's 1991 trading profit compared with 25% in 1987, though the drug business's proportion of profit was inflated somewhat by the depressed profits of more cyclical commodity businesses.
So far, so good. But many analysts point out that the threat of a Hanson bid has compelled ICI to dispose of many businesses at the bottom of an economic cycle. If it had acted earlier, when commodity chemical businesses were making more money, it probably could have got much better prices.
More troubling are analysts' complaints that, despite the changes of the past year, ICI has yet to outline a strategy for long-term growth. ICI's pharmaceutical operations are still much smaller than those of the drug industry's biggest firms, with which it competes. This matters, because the industry's leaders have just completed a wave of mergers in a search for economies of scale in research and marketing.
Unless ICI's drug subsidiary gets much bigger fast, either by discovering a blockbuster or by buying another drug firm, it could find itself outgunned. Equally disturbing, the patents of many of ICI's top-selling drugs are about to expire. ICI has launched some promising new drugs, but these may not be enough to offset sales lost because of expiring patents. It has little in the pipeline for three or four years from now.
Other chemical companies in a similar plight have either put their drug businesses into a joint venture or, like Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy, spent heavily to expand marketing and sales forces. ICI is reluctant to do either. It does not want to lose control of its drug business to a joint-venture partner. And spending huge sums on promotion or marketing makes little sense until it has a blockbuster drug to sell. As for farm chemicals, ICI expects to reap profit from its genetically engineered seeds, which can survive drought better than ordinary varieties. Though profits from such pioneering products could be handsome, they are still well over a decade away.
Sir Denys's moves to inject some sense of urgency and direction into a firm known for its sprawling bureaucracy and collegial management has, perhaps inevitably, produced boardroom grumbles that Sir Denys and Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief operating officer, have pushed other top managers aside. There are also complaints that, in a firm which has traditionally groomed successors well in advance, no obvious successors are emerging to Sir Denys. Mr Hampel is the same age. Though Sir Denys is not due to retire until 1995, doubts about the succession could eventually divide the board and distract the firm's managers. Ironically, ICI's managers believe they fended off a bid from Hanson by casting doubts on Hanson's succession and long-term prospects. Now ICI itself has to come up with answers on both subjects, or maybe attract another unwelcome suitor."
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224175890/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/41?accountid=14657,"For an object lesson in the difference between Japanese and British attitudes to competition, compare their recently privatised telephone companies, both reporting their annual results this week.
On May 21st BT announced pre-tax profits of L3.1 billion ($5.4 billion)--no change, despite recession, on the previous year. NTT's profits, due to be released four days later, after The Economist went to press, are expected to be Y240 billion-320 billion ($1.8 billion-2.4 billion)--a 22-42% drop. BT's return on sales was 23%; its cash reserve of L1 billion. NTT's return on sales is a more normal 7% or so, and it is taking on more debt.
The differences lie in the way the two firms are regulated. Japan and Britain both privatised their telephone monopolies in the 1980s. But BT faces only one, puny competitor, Cable & Wireless's Mercury subsidiary. And lax rules have allowed BT to make fat profits out of its 95% share of the domestic market. Meanwhile NTT's share of the Japanese market has slid to 74% as three bold new competitors have been allowed to snap at its heels.
Regulators have hit NTT hardest on pricing. To make up for falling profits on long-distance routes, NTT would like to raise the price of its loss-making local calls. So far, Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has refused to let it do this, though NTT hopes for a ""very drastic"" rate hike later this year. Since its competitors have no local lines of their own, they must ""interconnect"" with NTT's network to reach customers. In Britain BT is allowed to charge Mercury interconnection rates which make it impossible for the smaller firm to undercut its long-distance prices by much. NTT's regulators have treated it much more harshly, and rivals more kindly.
To try to stem the slide in its market share, NTT has doubled its advertising spending and introduced new services such as call conferencing, call waiting and high-speed faxing. Though brave, this strategy has failed. NTT's rivals have quickly introduced similar services, and analysts reckon they are gaining market share faster than ever. ""If Japanese, long-distance callers were completely rational, NTT would have zero market share,"" says Jeff Zavattero, an analyst at the Tokyo office of Jardine Fleming.
Like most other formerly state-owned telephone companies, NTT and BT are both grossly overmanned. Over the past few years, BT has used that as an opportunity to do what it calls ""mining inefficiencies""--i.e., increasing its profits by sacking tens of thousands of employees. Hampered by a tough union and paternalistic employment traditions, NTT cannot do the same.
The price for the increased competitiveness of Japan's telecoms market has been a shortfall in privatisation revenues. Back in 1987, when NTT was first privatised, the government planned to float 12-1/2% of the firm every year for four years, taking its own stake down to 50% by 1991. But NTT's share price has fallen so badly (see chart), that regulators have had to abandon the schedule. (Chart omitted) Today, 63% of the firm, currently worth more than Y6 trillion, remains in government hands, a huge wasting asset as long as competition continues to grow.
If they want to gain the full benefits of privatisation and deregulation, Japan and Britain will probably have to consider breaking up both NTT and BT, just as the American government compelled AT&T to break itself into long-distance and local telephone firms in 1983. Britain shows no signs of doing this. Japan has tried and failed. In 1985 and 1990 NTT used union support to foil break-up attempts. But the next government review of its status, due in 1995, may force the issue. As the price for leaving NTT intact in 1990, the postal ministry demanded that its own telecoms supremo, Shigeo Sawada, become the company's second-in-command. According to press speculation in Tokyo, he may use NTT's bad results to oust NTT's president before 1995's review, making a break-up more likely."

Over the years it has lent money for projects that have encouraged deforestation, moved settlers to lands that could not sustainably support them and financed dams, roads and power plants. If pressed, it has usually argued that development must come before the environment.
This year's World Development Report*, published earlier than usual to be ready for the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month, defends a different proposition. Not only is sound environmental policy essential for durable development, but many of the policies that improve environmental quality will also strengthen development.
Green lobbyists may decline to be wooed by the report. It was written not by the Bank's environment department but, like all its predecessors, by a team of economists specially assembled for the task. None was an environmental economist by training. The result was inevitably tension between the team and the Bank's in-house environmentalists, which culminated in the leaking of an intentionally provocative memo by Lawrence Summers, the Bank's chief economist (and so boss of the report's team).
Such friction aside, two aspects of the report will jar with deep greens. One is its insistence on the need to consider the costs and benefits of taking action, and the relative costs of different policy measures. This may be the way real-world policy-makers think (or ought to think), but many environmentalists seem to shudder at the thought of trade-offs between environmental and other objectives, or the weighing of costs and benefits.
Second, the report is mainly concerned with the kinds of environmental damage that harm human health or wealth in the poor countries, such as dirty water, dirty air and soil erosion. The report devotes far more space to these environmental problems, rarely on the agenda of northern greens, than to issues that many rich-country environmentalists believe are more pressing: conserving biological diversity and preventing climate change.
DIRT AND DEVELOPMENT
The cure for poverty is economic growth. This is a fact that makes environmentalists wince--because poor countries often argue that economic growth and protection of the environment are incompatible.
Not so, says the report. Or rather, not so as long as growth is regarded as a means to achieve development in the broad sense of improving the well-being of people. If economic growth fails to take proper account of environmental costs, it will not durably improve well-being.
But how are development and the environment to go hand in hand? To start with, environmental quality is itself part of the improvement in welfare that development must bring. For example, 1 billion people in developing countries have no access to clean water; 1.7 billion lack access to sanitation. The result is a huge toll of disease and death.
Next, environmental damage can undermine economic productivity. Some estimates suggest that the productivity of a tenth of all irrigated land has been severely affected by increased concentrations of salts, a direct result of bad irrigation practices. Dirty air can also affect future productivity: estimates for Bangkok which has awful traffic congestion, suggest that children lose an average of four or more points of IQ by the age of seven because of high levels of lead in their bodies.
Moreover, it is often the poorest people who suffer most from the consequences of environmental degradation. The rich can afford decent drinking water, the poor cannot. The rich cook on electricity; poor people cook on wood or charcoal stoves, whose fumes can cause the same sort of lung damage as smoking several packets of cigarettes a day. ""Sound environmental policies"", the report concludes, ""are thus likely to be powerfully redistributive.""
Just as protecting the environment is often a way to improve the lives of the poor, poverty is often a main cause of environmental damage. Poor people, living on the edge of subsistence, are much less able to invest in environmental protection. Studies in India found implicit discount rates among poor farmers of 30-40%--implying that they were willing to make an investment in, say, preventing soil erosion or planting trees only if it would treble its value in three years.
Bank policy has changed to take these high discount rates into account. For instance, the Bank now tackles erosion by encouraging farmers to plant hedges of tough grass, which are cheap and fast-growing, rather than build walls; and it encourages the planting of trees that can be coppiced for fodder and kindling while they grow.
WIN-WIN
The cure for poverty is development. Development may also cure some kinds of pollution. Charts 1 and 2 show the theory and the practice in the countries of the OECD. Since 1970 emissions of particulates (soot and dust) have fallen 60% in the industrial countries; emissions of oxides of sulphur (a component of acid rain) have fallen 38%. Lead emissions have dropped by 85% in North America and by 50% in most European cities. The frequency of oil spills has declined. Forested areas and protected habitats have been extended in many countries.
Plenty of environmental problems remain in developed countries, and some have got much worse. The output of nitrogen oxides (a component of city smog), of municipal and toxic wastes and of carbon dioxide has increased. The survival of many plant and animal species is threatened. But the moral is clear: given the right technologies, developing countries can decouple some kinds of pollution from economic growth.
Indeed, the policies that will help to bring about such decoupling may also be good for the economy. Many policies are justified on economic grounds alone, but have the incidental effect of improving environmental quality. Some of these ""win-win policies"" (see chart 3) have no net financial cost to governments, but they deliver gains to both economic efficiency and the environment.(chart 3 omitted) Others cost money, but bring economic gains that would justify them even without their benefits to the environment. The benefits of a third group of policies and investments outweigh their costs only when their environmental effects are included.
POLICIES AGAINST POLLUTION
For policy makers, the most valuable parts of the report may be its road maps of how to get there. Again and again, the emphasis is on proper pricing policies. Frequently, governments in developing countries deprive themselves of desperately needed revenue and set the wrong incentives by underpricing resources.
One extraordinary example is the provision of clean water. For years, development specialists have assumed that clean water should be provided cheaply by the government to the poor. The effective price charged for water, a recent Bank study reveals, is only about 35% of the average cost of supplying it. The upshot has been that supplies have often failed to keep up with fast-growing populations; and even when they have, they have been unreliable. In Latin America, for example, the level of leakage and of pipe breaks are respectively four times and 20 times higher than is normal in industrial countries.
As a result, the very poor frequently have to fall back on privately provided drinking water. In Latin American cities, water bought from vendors costs between four and 100 times as much as piped water. In Lima, a poor family uses only one-sixth as much water as a middle-class household, but its water bill is three times bigger.
Inadequate water supplies carry other economic costs. In many countries, families build storage tanks or dig wells to improve supply. To boil drinking water for ten minutes (as Peru's health ministry recommended during the recent cholera outbreak) would have cost more than a quarter of household income in a squatter settlement. The first ten weeks of that cholera outbreak lost Peru an estimated $1 billion in revenue from agricultural exports and tourism--more than three times the country's investment in water and sanitation for all of the 1980s.
In the case of water, sensible pricing policies would provide more revenue to install and maintain supplies. They would also encourage farmers to use irrigation water less wastefully, and thus release supplies for thirsty cities. But water is not the only resource that developing countries sell too cheaply for the good of their economies and their environments. The same is true of electricity.
As chart 4 shows, electricity prices in developing countries are typically about half those in the OECD industrial countries. (chart 4 omitted) The results match those for water: delivery is irregular, with consequent economic losses for industry, and waste is prevalent. In Bangladesh 31% of electricity is lost during transmission and distribution, compared with 8% in the United States. And developing countries use about 20% more electricity than they would do if consumers paid the true cost of supply.
Timber (chart 5) is another resource that is ludicrously underpriced. (chart 5 omitted) Although commercial logging is rarely the main cause of deforestation, it opens the way for the settlers who clear land. Forestry departments are chronically short of skilled manpower and equipment to police their territory. Yet the rates charged to loggers often cover only a tiny part of the costs of replacing the timber removed with wood grown in plantations.
Removing subsidies and setting proper prices will not be enough, of course, to reduce every sort of environmental damage. For that, governments need to introduce specific policies of various sorts. Some will be market-based, such as the hazardous-waste charges being considered in Bangkok; others will be regulatory, such as controls on land use. In every case, it will be important that standards are realistic and enforceable. Developing countries are all too apt to adopt the standards of OECD countries and then enforce them selectively. This breeds corruption and cynicism.
Institutions in developing countries are often too weak to meet the demands environmental policy places upon them. Often government departments lack skilled people and money. Donors, the Bank's report notes, often prefer to finance individual projects, which tie up scarce staff, rather than pay to set up and strengthen environmental administrations, which may in the end be more effective.
How much will all this cost? The report reckons that $75 billion a year, or 1.4% of developing-country GDP, would buy a wide range of measures, many of which would have non-environmental benefits (such as better education for girls, ""the most important long-term environmental policy in the developing world""). Costs will vary among countries and rise over time. But an annual figure of 2-3% of GDP by 2000 should be ""appropriate and sufficient"".
That seems high in absolute terms, but is small in relation to the additional incomes that good economic management can bring. Last year's report reckoned that countries with good policies achieved growth rates 2.5% higher than those with average or poor policies: by 2000, in other words, good policies could make output more than 20% higher than it would be otherwise.
WHO PAYS?
Ministers from developing countries who read the report on their way to the Earth Summit will hope to squeeze some of the added cost of domestic environmental policies from donor nations. They will note the report's recommendation that aid should go to new kinds of projects with environmental, rather than purely economic, gains. They will also be interested in the report's approach to biological diversity and greenhouse warming, the two issues that most interest the developed countries.
In both cases, the report argues that rich countries should be willing to pay poor ones for taking measures that go beyond their national interests. In the case of conservation, the World Bank estimates that it would cost $2.5 billion a year to extend protected areas by 50% over the next decade. Compare that with the $2 billion spent annually by the United States alone on its national parks.
In the case of global warming, the report's attitude is distinctly downbeat. The damage from climate change appears likely to be ""relatively modest""; in the case of the United States, the cost of adapting to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide might be 1% of GDP. By contrast, the costs of reducing the output of greenhouse gases might be between 3% and 7% of world GDP, and possibly much more in the case of developing countries. The implication is clear. Compared with cleaner water or the prevention of soil erosion, curbing global warming is a poor investment."

But it was only after academic options-pricing theory of the 1960s and 1970s met the volatile financial markets of the deregulating 1980s that options took off. So did futures, warrants, swaps, swaptions, collars, caps, floors, circuses and scores of other products known collectively as derivatives. Nothing today is transforming financial markets as rapidly and completely as what their inventors like to call tools for the management of financial risk. Nothing now gives so many financial regulators so many nightmares.
America's Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are increasingly worried about derivatives. So are European regulators, including the Bank of England and Britain's Securities and Investments Board, as newer varieties spread from America. Japanese regulators want to slow the growth of derivatives there.
What especially worries most of them is that banks are the biggest traders and counterparties, and neither banks (nor anyone else) understand the risks well enough to price them properly. A derivatives disaster could overwhelm the world's financial system, as third-world debt, highly leveraged transactions and property lending have not managed to do.
What are the chances of such a disaster? Maybe not big, but nobody really knows. That is what is frightening. For derivatives have exploded in recent years. A recent study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) puts banks' outstanding exchange-traded derivatives at $3.5 trillion at the end of 1991, up from $583 billion five years earlier. Interest-rate futures accounted for three-fifths of the total. Banks' over-the-counter derivatives (two-thirds of them interest-rate swaps) were $41 trillion last June, compared with only $500 billion at the end of 1986. Trading in derivatives often exceeds transactions in the markets for the underlying securities or currencies.
Banks and securities firms, companies and investors use derivatives to hedge risks, to gain access to cheaper money, to make profits. The products are likely to get even more popular, for three reasons.
Derivatives are proving cheaper to trade than the bonds, currencies, commodities and equities from which they are ""derived"". Exchanges have rushed to provide new standardised contracts to meet this demand. Over-the-counter trading has also soared with the increasing volume of products tailored to the needs of particular customers.
Another reason is simple familiarity, and more sophisticated ways of pricing and managing derivatives' risks. Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, academic economists who were hired by Goldman Sachs and Salomon respectively, developed the options-pricing model that gave the derivatives a theoretical foundation--and their Wall Street employers a competitive trading edge. They are now revising their model.
A third spur is that in many countries legal, fiscal and regulatory restrictions on the use of derivatives have been eased. In Britain unit trusts are now allowed to invest in futures and options. Most importantly, the new Basle bank-capital rules weight derivatives more lightly than assets that appear on banks' balance sheets. Banks need less capital to hedge or speculate through derivatives than to carry the underlying assets.
While derivatives zoom, regulators and even financial folk are panting behind in their attempts to assess their risks. The first is posed by the volatility of the underlying markets. A market participant's exposure can change rapidly if, say, interest rates or share prices suddenly change. Derivatives are often highly geared, and a small movement in share prices, for instance, can trigger a big change in the value of a stock index option. Hedging secondary-market positions is difficult; anyway it is by taking risk that a trader makes money.
Measuring just the value of a derivative can be difficult enough. Many are arcane or unique, with no benchmark to determine their worth. Positions often stretch across several markets, through, say, an option on a combined interest-rate and currency swap (a swaption on a circus, in the jargon).
The second big risk is managerial. The increasing complexity of derivatives makes it difficult for managers to keep track of their traders. In 1987 Merrill Lynch lost $377m trading mortgage related derivatives, in part because of unauthorised transactions. Merrill, and other firms, have tightened internal controls but it is always a struggle to keep up. A firm's managerial control is only as good as its mathematics. It is the derivatives desks that have the MIT PhDs, not the chairmen's offices.
Credit quality is another problem. Although exchanges are the counterparty in exchange-traded derivatives, the growing volume of over-the-counter products requires financial firms to judge the creditworthiness of their partners accurately. And derivative positions are becoming longer-term. Traditionally, those who traded securities, foreign exchange and commodities were skilled at taking short-term risks. As that changes, the chances increase that even a prudent firm will end up, as counterparty to a naive risk manager. Wise firms are monitoring more carefully their exposures to specific counterparties.
A fourth risk is that of illiquidity. Some secondary markets for derivatives have plenty of buyers and sellers. The more tailored and long-term the derivative, however, the scarcer active traders become. Positions that cannot easily be liquidated are harder to value and to hedge.
Then there are legal risks. The legal aspects of derivatives are hazy, as banks were shocked to find after entering into swaps with British local authorities. The contracts were voided by the courts because the authorities had no right to enter into them. Regulators know that all this adds up to potential trouble. Tighter control of derivatives seems inevitable. American regulators have started to rein in where they can what they consider excessively risky products. The SEC has stopped mutual funds from buying some municipal-bond derivatives and is restricting the issue of hybrid bondcum-derivatives to large companies. Yet regulators are still far from knowing how to measure the risks, still less deal with them.
In the meantime, regulators will be looking more closely at the banks' off-balance-sheet assets. The BIS says that these assets (which include derivatives) are more than seven times as large as balance-sheet items at some American banks. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, recently told bankers that they ""had all better take a very, very hard look at off-balance-sheet activities, including the payments, clearance and settlement risks associated with many of those activities. I hope this sounds like a warning, because it is."""

The state's law ensures that it takes creditors years to foreclose on a building. If they persist, they may find that their defaulter invokes the generous protection of New York's bankruptcy courts. On May 19th Olympia & York, the Reichmanns' property company, played tough with bond-holders who had supposed themselves secured on 55 Water Street, a vast New York tower. Across O&Y's empire, lenders are finding that piles of legal documents offer less protection than they once thought.
The Water Street creditors, who hold bonds worth $548m, were told that next year rents from the building would be insufficient to service this debt. Tenants are leaving; by the end of 1993 two-fifths of the building may be empty; by 1994 cash flow is expected to have slowed to $5.2m, while $35.9m of interest is due. The building needs $100m-200m to prepare it for new tenants, and to pay agents to find them. O&Y invited lenders to dig into their own pockets for that. As recently as March, Moody's, a credit-rating agency, had reported that O&Y's troubles should not hurt Water Street's bond-holders.
The lenders can lump it, or they can foreclose. Water Street is a special case, since bond-holders are unlikely to grab a building set to make such losses. Yet lenders to healthier buildings have suffered similar indignities. The Oppenheimer building, part of New York's World Financial Centre, is generating enough rent to service its bonds. The building is registered as a company; its revenues are supposed to go to pay debts before they pass to O&Y, its owner. O&Y has diverted money from it anyway. The sanction of foreclosure is so extreme and cumbersome that it is not credible. The creditors, led by Nomura, have agreed to go without interest payments for the moment.
O&Y has at least half-a-dozen such company-buildings in Canada. Their creditors supposed they would continue to be paid, so long as the buildings were healthy. But on May 14th O&Y invoked the bankruptcy laws to escape this obligation. The bond-holders should eventually get most of their money. But they may have to wait months for it, unless a legal appeal launched on May 21st succeeds in removing these buildings from the courts' protection. Credit-rating agencies are taking no chances. On May 20th Standard & Poor's put the debt of Royal Bank of Canada on credit watch, giving its exposure to O&Y as the reason.
Some property folk say that this episode holds lessons. They talk of lender-appointed trustees collecting rents, so that owners lose their chance to swipe them. Under American law, at least, this arrangement might prove awkward. Rent collectors are deemed liable for maintaining buildings. Imagine an outbreak of legionnaire's disease: the damages could make the diversion of bond payments seem a mild problem.
For the moment, O&Y's creditors are trying to control their losses. A group of bankers that lent $2.5 billion to the parent company may mount their own challenge to the Canadian bankruptcy order. O&Y says that, in return for patience, it offers most lenders a share in the profits of eventual recovery. This will mean different things for different lenders. Japanese banks, for example, do not want equity in O&Y. And since they are not obliged to provide against bad loans, they are willing to let things drift rather than pressing for foreclosure. America's and Canada's regulators insist on prompt writedowns, and their banks are pushing O&Y for information, cash and collateral.
In London the 11 bank lenders to Canary Wharf are more united because their loans are similarly secured. They have still not decided whether to continue backing the project, however. Their procrastination can hardly help it attract new tenants. But it is a banker's job to niggle. Property men, on the other hand, have vision."

In 1971, and again in 1987, sharp cuts in interest rates stoked growth; growth pushed up rents; high rents spurred banks to shower cash on property developers. Both bubbles burst when interest rates rose again. The economy slowed, and with it demand for new offices. The property men found they had built too much. Higher interest rates left many unable to service their loans. What happened next? That is where the 1970s and now are different.
In 1975 and 1976 troubled property companies sold around L1.5 billion-worth of assets to pension and insurance funds. That L1.5 billion represents almost L5.2 billion in today's pounds, or $9.6 billion. It amounted to more than half the market value of all quoted property companies at their pre-crash peak in 1973. Thanks to these investors, property values were rising faster than inflation by 1977.
This time, the funds seem disinclined to repeat that rescue. Their assets have multiplied many times over the past 20 years, so digesting a property crash ought to be easier. Yet, since the top of the property market in 1989, they have made only modest purchases. In 1990 and 1991 they bought, net, a total of L3.4 billion of new property. That represents, in real terms, just half of the property they acquired in 1975-76. And it amounts to just a fifth of the value of quoted property stocks at their peak in 1989.
Why are institutions so reticent? Partly because they have proportionately less new money than they did. Contractual savings were growing faster in the 1970s than now. Pension funds exploded. In 1975 they collected new money equal to 32% of their total assets at the start of the year, according to the WM Company, a research firm; in 1976 they landed a still remarkable 22%. This rush of new money enabled the funds to wade deeply into the property market without vastly increasing the share of their assets in property.
The flood of new money is slowing. Wages are growing much more slowly than in the mid-1970s, and the 1980s bull market has left pension funds brimming with cash. Many firms have taken contribution holidays: the net flow into WM'S universe of pension funds slowed to 3% of assets in 1990 and 1991. Recession has stopped the 1980s boom in sales of new life-insurance policies.
Next, property is less attractive than it was. The building frenzy of the past five years has been even more extravagant than the excesses 15 years earlier. Vacancy rates in City offices went as high as 10.7% in 1975-76. Now they are nearing 20%.
Nobody buying an office building now can count on rents rising. In fact they may fall. The traditional London lease ties the tenant down for 25 years, and provides for rents to be revised only upwards. Last year, however, Herring Baker Harris, a property consultancy, conducted a survey of new City leases. Just one in five tied in the tenant for 25 years without offering more than minor sweeteners. Foreign tenants, largely absent in the 1970s, bridle at the English lease.
Rival investments, by contrast, have grown more attractive. In the 1970s returns on British bonds and equities were out-paced by inflation--a nightmare for investors with real liabilities, such as an obligation to pay workers a proportion of their salary on retirement. The government had not yet begun to issue index-linked gilts. Exchange controls made it hard for investors to buy foreign securities. Only property, with its long leases and upward-only rent reviews, promised a reliable income that would rise with inflation. Adventurous funds bet on it heavily. Imperial Tobacco's pension fund, famous for leading others into equities after the second world war, had half its money in property in the 1960s.
All this changed in the early 1980s. Inflation fell. Index-linked gilts made their debut. Investors began to explore foreign markets. Property, an awkward asset difficult to trade, looked less alluring. Pension funds had 21% of their assets in property in 1981, but only 8% in 1990.
And so, when banks overextended themselves in the late 1980s, the institutions did come to the rescue with another great deleveraging--but this time they avoided property. Instead they rescued quoted companies. These issued L43 billion-worth of new equity in 1989-91, over five times more, in real terms, than British companies issued in 1974-76. Institutions were the biggest group of buyers. That L43 billion would have been more than enough to cancel the entire bank debt of property companies in Britain.
Pension and insurance funds will continue to buy property, but they will be selective. Anything without a tenant, or in a poor location, is virtually unsellable. Optimists protest that yields are at historic highs; indeed, at 9.2%, they are pushing up against gilt yields. Yet for London offices, at least, there seems no guarantee that yields will ever fall. Perhaps it is past yields, not today's, that were aberrant, reflecting the warped world of exchange controls and inflation.
Banks are therefore stuck with the consequences of inflating the property bubble. They have succeeded in reducing their loans to property only slowly, from L40.2 billion to L39.2 billion in the year to February. At times a third of these loans were behind in their repayments; but few banks have managed to seize property and sell it. Will this teach them a lesson?"

Less than a month ago the finance ministry stated that bad debts at the 11 city (big commercial) banks, three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks totaled Y8 trillion ($57 billion) at the end of March. (Bad debts were defined as loans on which interest had not been paid for at least six months.) A senior finance-ministry official added at a mind-numbing briefing for foreign journalists last week that eventual loan losses might not be more than Y2 trillion-3 trillion. Unauthorised leaks from an internal study made by the Bank of Japan late last year have since made those estimates look far too small, and many officials look rather foolish.
The study came to two conclusions. First, the central bank's own estimate of the likely peak in bad debts was Y29 trillion--though exactly when that peak was to occur was not specified. Out of these bad debts, Y11 trillion were reckoned to be on city banks' books and another Y10 trillion split evenly between the long-term credit banks and the trust banks. Second, the banks themselves thought that many more of their loans were at risk. Adding these to the estimate of bad debts, the total for suspect domestic debt in the system may be as much as Y56 trillion for all banks.
The publicity given to these figures has irked the Bank of Japan. The bank has been at pains to point out that it has not officially endorsed the bankers' Y56 trillion estimate and has launched an investigation to find the source of the leak. Fretting central bankers should relax. Investors lost confidence long ago. Many, like those who sold bank shares short late last year, have for some time believed that problem debts might top even Y56 trillion. Bank shares have not slipped greatly since the leaks, for their price already reflected the information.
Two questions now matter. The first is whether bad debts will prove to be even larger than the alarmingly high figures now in the public domain. The answer depends largely on the property market. The second issue is whether, with time, banks can earn their way out from under their bad debts. That, at any rate, is the strategy they propose to adopt; the banks are extremely reluctant to write off loans.
David Atkinson, a financial analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, reckons that banks should be able to manage their way through--provided, crucially and perhaps improbably, that they do not break ranks and start dumping collateral. Assuming gloomily, that Japanese banks receive no interest on Y56 trillion of doubtful loans, it will cost them Y2.5 trillion to carry the deadweight, at their current average cost of money (4.5%). Assuming, also gloomily, that the three groups of big banks have to shoulder all the lost income themselves, that burden would wipe about 70 basis points (seven-tenths of one percentage point) off the spreads on their loans, which totalled Y355 trillion at the end of September 1991. Since banks earn roughly two percentage points on their loans against costs of 1.2 points, this worst case would still leave them marginally profitable.
So thin a margin of comfort suggests that Japanese banks will need to charge borrowers more for money, and that the cost of capital will rise markedly for Japanese companies. This has unpleasant implications for the many firms that will have to refinance expiring warrant issues in the next two years, unless the Tokyo stockmarket recovers sharply. Certainly few companies will be able to follow the example of Toyota, which this week raised $1 billion on fine terms, in the world's largest international corporate-bond issue ever. With an $800m warrant issue due to expire in July, the car maker's share price is now well below the exercise price of Y2,009. Nomura International, joint lead underwriter for the issue, says that the number of Japanese companies which could launch a Eurodollar issue on similar terms can be counted on one hand. Among them is Matsushita. The electronics company announced its own $1 billion bond issue on May 21st."

After the scandals over Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), a new law to toughen the oversight of foreign banks, and proposed new rules to implement that law, have alarmed foreign bankers. Efforts by Democrats to draw attention to the CIA'S shady dealings with foreign banks during the Reagan and Bush administrations may soon give them further cause to worry.
As part of its banking reforms last year, Congress passed the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act (FBSEA). This required foreign banks to be more closely supervised, but left the Federal Reserve to draw up detailed rules. Last month the Fed published proposed regulations and asked for comments by June 5th. Foreign bankers--and some Fed governors--think the rules are too tough and will scare away foreign banks from commercial lending in America.
The biggest change in the FBSEA is that all foreign banks now come under the authority of the Fed, as well as of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or a state supervisor. Foreign bankers fear the new burdens that this multiplication of supervisors is already bringing. Scandal-free foreign banks say they have been under closer scrutiny for months; even routine applications take far longer than before, they say, and demand more paperwork. The Fed is hiring 250 new examiners to look only at foreign banks.
Approval by the Fed (as well as a licence from the OCC or state supervisor) is now required before a foreign bank can establish a new American branch or office. The Fed recently blocked an application by the Banco Nacional de Mexico to open a branch in Florida, though state regulators had approved it last year. The new act says that the Fed may not give permission unless it is satisfied that the foreign bank's worldwide activities are adequately supervised by its authorities at home; the proposed rules place the burden of proof on the bank. Even when they try, few developing-country governments manage to regulate foreign branches of their banks effectively. If the Fed insists on being told about any part of a parent bank's international operations, including those now covered by national bank-secrecy laws, banks in some rich countries will find it equally difficult to comply.
Under the new law, a foreign bank must also get the Fed's blessing before taking an equity stake of more than 5% in an American bank; the old limit was 10%. In an even more controversial change, it must also create a separately incorporated American subsidiary before it can take federally-insured deposits from the public. (Foreign-bank branches that were previously allowed to take insured deposits are exempted.)
This last requirement is more than inconvenient red tape. It will reduce foreign banks' capacity to lend. A bank's lending limit will be determined by the capital of its American subsidiary rather than by the capital of the whole bank, as is now the case. It is not clear whether Congress intended its measure to extend to uninsured wholesale money, too. Regulators, foreign bankers believe, have already lowered their confidential ratings of foreign banks, anticipating that their capital bases will shrink.
America has been a growing market for foreign banks. They have more than doubled their lending there in the past decade to $203 billion last year, or one-third of all bank lending. As regulatory demands and declining credit ratings have caused American banks to retrench, foreign banks (especially higher-rated ones) have filled the gap. At first Japanese banks did so eagerly; lately they have trimmed their lending. Then European banks stepped forward, along with banks from Australia and developing countries such as Taiwan, Brazil and Mexico.
The new and proposed restrictions make foreign banks wonder whether an American banking licence is worth the bother. Some no longer consider an American presence to be essential. Those that still want to be in America--and they are many--are asking whether it might be better to enter in the guise of a securities firm or insurance company rather than as a commercial bank.
For some, an attempt by Democratic congressmen to extend American arms-export laws to foreign banks may help settle the issue. Legislation before the House of Representatives would require regulators to withhold or revoke the licences of foreign banks that violate restrictions in American law on financing trade in arms and weapons-related technology. It would also forbid banks of which foreign governments own more than 25% to do any business in America except limited trade finance.
Behind this draft law, which is strongly opposed by the Fed, lies state-owned BNL's illicit financing of sales of arms to Iraq. Did Republican administrations tell regulators to look the other way when foreign banks were doing work for the CIA? Democrats in Congress want a formal investigation to tell them. With elections looming, this may open a chasm into which many foreign banks, virtuous or otherwise, could tumble."

The French did not expect to find themselves on the ropes so soon, however. On May 19th a German regional court said that the bosses of AMB could refuse to register the voting rights on the shares in it that AGF had acquired. AGF, which suspects that its state-owned status counted against it, says it will appeal against the ruling.
This decision concludes the latest round in a battle that began last year, when AGF paid FFr3.5 billion ($620m)for a quarter of AMB's shares. The French firm wanted to ensure AMB's co-operation, thus gaining a foothold in the world's third-largest insurance market. But Wolf Dieter Baumgartl, AMB's boss, was not in co-operative mood. Invoking a defence in the company's statutes, he limited AGF's voting rights to just 9%. Infuriated, Michel Albert, AGF's chief executive, sent for his lawyers.
Why is AMB so determined to resist AGF's advances? Its reluctance seems strange, since it was AMB that first suggested a possible partnership, in 1990. The answer is that Mr Baumgartl suspects Mr Albert of wanting outright control of his firm. ""We invited him [Albert] to a dinner party, and he appears to have taken the view that it is a Roman orgy,"" says Piers von Simson of S.G. Warburg, the merchant bank advising AMB.
As proof of AGF's hostile intentions, AMB claims that in previous negotiations the French refused to limit themselves to any particular stake. AGF wanted the right to vet anybody seeking a big stake in the company, they say. They also claim the French demanded that the shares of all AMB's subsidiaries be put into a trust and not sold without its prior agreement.
AGF, however, maintains that it simply wants to exchange shares with AMB in a deal similar to the one being hatched by Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Germany's Dresdner Bank. As well as working together abroad, AGF thinks the two should work together to sell reinsurance and cover for industrial risk in Germany. It has its eyes on AMB's direct-marketing activities too. In reply, the Germans point out that AGF's reinsurance and industrial-risk operations are already in the red.
In spite of this resistance, AGF does not intend to give up. Instead, it is betting that two things will make AMB's management change its mind. The first is an audit by Price Waterhouse, an accountancy firm, of several suspect deals between AMB and La Fondiaria, its Italian ally, which is due to be delivered to AMB's shareholders in July. AMB may have subsidised the Italian insurer's purchase of some of its shares. As a result, the Italians now control a fifth of the German firm.
The second key to a solution could be the Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft (BFG), AMB's ailing banking unit. AGF says that Credit Lyonnais, a state-owned French bank, is interested in buying a stake in the BFG, but negotiations cannot begin until the spat over voting rights has been resolved. AMB is unlikely to be tempted so soon into abandoning its victory in the courts, however--which means that the next round of this Franco-German battle is likely to end up there too."

The Association Tripartite Bourse, which groups the Zurich, Geneva and Basle exchanges, said it was ditching a blueprint drawn up by Andersen Consulting: it was too risky, the association said, both financially and technically. In May the bourses said they would try again, this time without Andersen.
The exchanges plan to work with SOFFE, the automated Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange. They aim to devise an electronic system based on one developed for Australia's stock exchanges, which itself borrowed from SOFFE. If all goes well, the new system should be working in 1994 and in full swing in 1996. That might still enable Switzerland to claim a global first in wholly automated securities and derivatives trading.
In 1988 SOFFE was the first of several futures markets to establish automated trading and clearing. Electronic trading (computerised matching of buyers and sellers) is spreading around the world. The Swiss want to go further. They want to automate dealing in all securities--bonds, shares and other paper--and to provide more versatile computer-trading work-stations.
These stations present the biggest technical challenge for EBS designers. They would allow traders to see and analyse all sorts of market information, as well as eventually to trade derivatives and the underlying securities simultaneously. They would link with banks' own internal computer systems; this matters because all securities trades in Switzerland are routed through the banks. Thus a bank customer's order to buy shares (which could itself be transmitted to the bank by computer) might wing its way into the EBS without a pen or telephone being lifted. This should cut dealing costs, especially for smaller customers.
The bourses expect to spend around SFr75m on the new electronic trading system--not counting what banks, most of which support the change, will have to spend to develop their own compatible systems. Smaller traders in Zurich show less enthusiasm; they have just celebrated the opening of a new SFr90m stock-exchange building with traditional ""open outcry"" trading floors. Yet in the longer term Zurich stands to benefit from the new plan.
Lately the city has been losing business to foreign financial centres. Neatly a fifth of the trading in leading Swiss shares now takes place on London's screen-based SEAQ (Stock Exchange Automated Quotation) International. Heavy stamp duties are partly to blame; these will be lowered if voters approve in a referendum in September. Poor liquidity and lack of transparency have also deterred potential customers.
A proposed federal law to tighten regulation and investor protection should make the markets more attractive--but the new EBS would help, too. True, it might halt the increasing concentration of securities trading within Switzerland on Zurich, which has led to the closure of four small regional bourses and threatens even Basle and Geneva. But Zurich would find that effect more than outweighed if Switzerland could stay in the front rank of financial centres and begin to attract new international business. For that, most financial folk reckon, electronic trading is just as essential as the regulatory reforms."

Share prices in America, Britain, France and Germany began to move a bit more in tandem towards the end of the 1980s; not so, or not obviously, those in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Are Asian prices guided by different rules from those that are knitting together markets elsewhere?
A study by Stephen Brown of New York University and Toshiyuki Otsuki of the International University of Japan sheds some new light on the question*. Stockmarkets on the eastern rim of the Pacific are in fact better integrated into the global capital market than many of those in Europe, its authors reckon.
They start from the assumption that investors are compensated for bearing risk. Though this sounds obvious enough, it is in fact the central message of one of the most important recent contributions to financial economics--the arbitrage-pricing theory (APT) thought up by Stephen Ross of Yale. This, at its simplest, says that if an investor earns a higher-than-normal return on an investment, it is only because he is taking a higher-than-normal risk. Arbitrage--buying and selling by other investors--competes away any return above the reward for extra risk-bearing.
What is far from obvious is whether stockmarkets everywhere are affected by the same global risks; and, if they are, what proportion of the total riskiness of each market is due to global pressures. This is what Mr Brown and his colleague set out to test.
First they worked out the main reasons why an American investing in the FT-Actuaries World Index (a composite of 21 national markets) between March 1981 and March 1991 might not have received the returns that history suggested. They found four sorts of surprises which they termed ""global risk factors"": changes in the dollar's value against other currencies; changes in the gap between American and world interest rates; unexplained seasonal factors; and ""global market risk"", a catch-all for the unexpected returns on the world index that were not explained by the other three factors. Market risk includes, importantly, unpredictable changes in investor sentiment.
The authors then turned their model on national equity markets, to, see how far their four factors explained the returns to American investors. Global risks accounted for 84% of unexpected changes in returns on the S&P 500, and nearly as much (81%) in Tokyo. Global factors were less important in other bits of the Pacific Rim, explaining around 40% of changes in Malaysia and Singapore, and about 30% in Australia and Hong Kong. They were almost equally important in Italy (39%), France (38%) and Germany (36%). When global factors do affect Pacific markets, however, they tend to push share prices far harder than in America.
Messrs Brown and Otsuki calculated how large a premium (over the return on American Treasury bills) an American investor would need to earn in each share market to compensate him for carrying securities riskier than those government securities. Between 1981 and 1989 an American investor required a premium averaging 6.4% a year to invest in American shares, 15.7% to invest in Singapore and 19.2% to buy shares in Tokyo.
The finding that risk premiums are lower on equity investments at home is unsurprising for these are less exposed to exchange-rate risks. More interesting is the fact that share prices in both Japan and Singapore are more sensitive than those in America to surprise changes in global investor sentiment; uneasy world investors are apt to unload more in East Asia than in New York. In this respect the Asian markets are more integrated into the global framework than America's, not less. As the chart shows, however, the reward for bearing risk in them is about enough--in Singapore and Hong Kong--to compensate for their extra riskiness. (Chart omitted)
The notable exception is Japan. An American investing in Tokyo in the 1980s earned, in dollars, an average of 11.2% a year more than he would have collected on Treasury bills. That is well short of the premium of 19.2% which the study's authors reckon reflected the risk of investing in shares there. Those who timed their moves deftly made big money in the Tokyo stockmarket. But those who settled in for the longer haul did not do as well as they should have expected to do.
* ""Risk Premia in Pacific-Rim Capital Markets."" By Stephen Brown and Toshiyuki Otsuki. New York University Working Paper, May 1992"
23-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224146424/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/52?accountid=14657,"When, in 1990, a group of physicists announced that they could easily produce carbon molecules that looked like soccer balls by zapping rods of graphite with a large electric current, they brought more than just a new substance into the world. The 60-carbon-atom molecule--C60--is named buckminsterfullerene in honour of Buckminster Fuller, pioneer of the geodesic dome, and known as the buckyball to its ever-growing retinue of admirers. It has opened the way into an entirely new field of chemistry. Eager exploration of this new terrain has already produced more than 1,000 papers, and the number of possible applications is still unknown.
To appreciate the novelty, first consider carbon's other pure forms. In a diamond each atom is tied tightly to four others by chemical bonds. In graphite the atoms lie in sheets of hexagons, with each atom bound to three others. These chicken-wire sheets sit in stacks, sliding past each other easily, which makes graphite a great lubricant.
Buckyballs are made when very hot carbon atoms and fragments of graphite bang into each other; The graphite fragments are warped because the atoms at the frayed edges of the sheet, eager to bind to something, reach out for each other. If a single carbon atom chances to bump into the edge at that point, it can join with two loose ends to form a pentagon. Pentagons will tend to make the surface more curved.
A sheet of hexagons will tend to lie flat; a mixture of pentagons and hexagons will not. If the conditions are just right, the growing fragment will be able to adjust itself so that the pentagons stay away from each other--adjacent pentagons are unstable--and the surface will curl up until it eventually closes, leaving no bare edge at all. The spherical C60 buckyball is the most common end-product, because this familiar pattern--known as a truncated icosahedron, and familiar to everyone who has seen the pentagons and hexagons on a soccer ball--is the smallest in which all the pentagons can be kept apart by hexagons. Smaller arrangements, ""buckybabies"" of as few as 32 atoms, have been made, but because they contain adjacent pentagons they are much less stable. If more hexagon are added, larger molecules can be made which keep the pentagons even farther apart. Researchers can produce C70, C76 and C78 routinely. In principle, they can make ludicrously large bucky behemoths like C960.
Since it is easy to make buckyballs and their different-sized relatives (generically known as fullerenes), it might seem surprising that they were not discovered earlier. The reason appears to be that normally, when bits of carbon burn, there are other molecules such as hydrogen around, which react with the curling fragments and stunt their growth. The first evidence of buckyballs came only in the mid-1980s when Harold Kroto at Sussex University and Richard Smalley and his colleagues at Rice University in Houston zapped graphite with powerful lasers. Only after Wolfgang Kratschmer at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelburg and Donald Huffman at the University of Arizona found how to make them with just graphite and electricity did useful quantities of the stuff become available. Now buckyball start-ups like SES Research in Houston, Texas, will supply you with one milligram of pure C60 for $2, with a discount for orders over a gram; a gram of raw soot from which to get your own buckyballs costs a mere $9.50. Eventually researchers hope, industrial-scale production could bring the price of pure C60 down to a few dollars a kilogram.
OLD TRICKS FOR NEW MOLECULES
Once you have them, what do you do with them? The classical techniques of chemistry have been slow finding answers. Buckyballs are hard to interest in the hurly-burly of chemical reactions, preferring to stand, self-satisfied, to one side. The carbon atoms in buckyballs are all tied up--there is no obvious way to attach anything to them.
Nevertheless, chemical ingenuity has met with some success. It is possible to add an extra atom of carbon to the outside of a fullerene, thus forming a fulleroid. That gives you a handle to which you can attach other molecular species. Fred Wudl and his colleagues at the University of California in Santa Barbara have synthesised 18 new substances in this way.
A more ambitious goal is to replace some of the carbon atoms in the buckyball shell with atoms of other species. Last month Baochuan Guo and colleagues at Pennsylvania State University announced they had found clusters containing 12 carbon atoms and 8 titanium atoms. These 20 atoms could fit together to form a solid made of 12 pentagons and no hexagons. The researchers think that the metal atoms may make it easier for the carbon bonds to form stable pentagons. If this guess is right, the implication is profound: the fullerene family may be part of a far larger clan.
Solid-state physicists are making strides that are no less impressive. They have found that solid materials made out of buckyballs have some surprising properties. When the molecules crystallise, they fit together like a stack of oranges at a greengrocer's, the balls held together by weak forces like those between sheets of graphite. A clump of buckyballs can be squeezed to 70% of its original volume at a pressure of 3,000 atmospheres; decompress it and it just springs back to its original shape. If pushed too close together, though, carbon atoms in neighbouring balls begin to repel each other strongly; the material becomes harder than diamond. Push quickly and very hard, and it actually becomes diamond, a transformation that could be of interest to industry.
The weak chemical forces between buckyballs are this material's great drawback. These forces can be disrupted by thermal vibrations at quite low temperatures. At only 300degC or so, a solid lump of buckyballs starts to evaporate--as do hopes of using the stuff as a lubricant, like graphite. Temperatures tend to be high where lubrication is needed.
Put some metallic grit in this failed lubricant, though, then chill it down, and something wonderful happens. Last year Art Hebard and his colleagues at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey found that a mixture of buckyballs and potassium, cooled to -255degC, became a superconductor: electric currents passed through it without any resistance. Peter Stephens at the University of New York at Stony Brook and his co-workers soon confirmed that in this superconducting structure the metal atoms were sitting in between the buckyballs, as if an artistic greengrocer had squeezed apricots into the gaps between his oranges.
Mixing other metals with their buckyballs, researchers have achieved superconducting temperatures as high as -230degC--fast approaching the current record for any superconductor. It appears that with every extra tenth of a millionth of a millimetre the balls are pushed apart by the metal atoms, the maximum temperature increases by a hefty 55degC. This relationship implies that a superconductor that works at room temperature--for which there could be a vast number of uses--may be achievable. But recent results from America and Japan are making scientists properly sceptical about any such straight-line extrapolations. And there is another snag; the new superconductors burn to a crisp when exposed to air.
APPLY WITH CAUTION
Scientists are fascinated by the fullerenes' possibilities. Almost too fascinated: in their excitement, some talk of far-fetched, and even silly, applications. Despite that, some buckyball work will soon be of genuine interest to industry, which is already devoting a good deal of time and money to the subject.
One potential application uses the buckyball's less symmetrical big brother, C70. A group in Illinois has shown that a thin layer of C70 on a silicon surface can spur on the growth of a diamond film when exposed to hot methane and hydrogen: the diamond film is produced a billion times faster with the C70 seeds than without. Such diamond films can harden tool surfaces, or be used to insulate microelectronic circuits from each other. And it is also possible, though not necessarily practical, to make diamonds from fullerenes directly.
Fullerene films have other intriguing properties. In March scientists at Hughes Research Laboratories in California reported that C60 and C7O, dissolved in a mixture of other chemicals, had a remarkable response to light: however much shines in, the same amount comes out. Substances like this, that become more opaque in brighter light, are called optical limiters. They can protect sensitive detectors; and they can help to process optical information, levelling peaks in signals. The C6O-based limiter--which Hughes is trying to reproduce in the form of a thin film--works with much dimmer light than most optical limiters, a great advantage.
Du Pont's Central Research Laboratory in Delaware has found another useful property. Add C60 and C7O to the right polymer and you get an excellent photoconductor--a material that coducts electricity only when exposed to light, and which is used in devices that make electronic images. With large fullerenes it might be possible to produce a photoconductor that works in the infra-red part of the spectrum, something not currently available.
Many other applications are under investigation. Some, attractive at first sight, are less so on a closer look. Take the idea of putting drugs inside fullerenes to get them to a particular part of the body safely. It sounds fine, and researchers have already shown that metal atoms can be trapped in fullerenes if they are present in the extremely hot vapour from which the fullerenes have been made. The new record for this sort of packaging belongs to a Japanese team. It has just managed to produce C82 molecules with three atoms of the metal scandium in each of them. To wrap a drug, though, would be harder--and to unwrap it is, as yet, impossible. Also, nobody knows what harm, if any, fullerenes do in the body. Since graphite is quite safe, there is no need to panic about this, but it is clearly important to find out.
Growing so fast, the field can afford a few outlandish predictions--especially since it is never clear which will be the duds, and which will make somebody a fortune, or win them a Nobel prize, or both. Almost the only thing all the experts can agree on is that most of what is now known, or presumed, or at least rumoured, will be out of date in a few months' time--exactly the sort of situation that makes science fun and fruitful.
TUBULAR BALLS
Sometimes the best place to look for novelties is the spot that everybody else has ignored. While researchers everywhere have been electrocuting carbon rods and sifting through the resulting soot for fullerenes, Sumio Iijima at NEC Fundamental Research Laboratories looked at the rods instead. Putting their burnt ends under his electron microscope, he observed a criss-cross pattern of stange, tube-like objects, each only a few millionths of a millimetre in diameter but sometimes as much as a thousand times longer than that. They were sheets of graphite rolled up like the leaves in a cigar.
Reproducing these carbon microtubes has proved a lot trickier than making fullerenes. But Dr Iijima and his colleagues have pressed on undaunted. They have traced the tubes to their roots, which appear to be protrusions on large, oddly shaped, multi-layered fullerenes--soot, in other words. The tubes grow not as a set of rings stuck one to the next but as a continuous spiral, looking a little like a corkscrew. Loose carbon atoms naturally stick to the end of this spiral, allowing the tube to continue its winding growth. Theorists predict that the pitch of the corkscrew determines the tube's electrical properties; tubes can be insulators, conductors or semiconductors.
The NEC team has come up with a simple explanation for how the tube changes shape, sometimes spreading out into a funnel, sometimes changing direction abruptly. In graphite, carbon lies in flat sheets of hexagons. If one hexagon on such a surface is replaced with a pentagon, the surface can no longer stay flat. It forms a dip, with the pentagon at the bottom. The effect is like cutting a wedge out of a flat circle and joining the edges, thereby making a cone. Add enough pentagons, and the dips come together to form a hollow ball--which is how fullerenes are made.
Introduce instead a seven-sided flaw and you can bend the surface in another way, to form a saddle rather than a cone. It turns out that these defects, produced by adding pentagons and heptagons to a growing sheet of hexagons, are all it takes to explain the odd shapes Dr Iijima's group has seen.
If a heptagonal defect suddenly crops up in the spiralling growth of a tube of hexagons, the tube will splay outwards like a funnel. A pentagon defect a bit further along will bend the funnel back into a cylinder, but now with a bigger diameter. In theory a few pentagons and heptagons can make a limitless variety of tube forms. In this topological game ther appears to be just one unbreakable rule: for the tube to be a closed surface, without gaps or flaws, there must be 12 more pentagons than there are heptagons. A simplest way to satisfy that constraint: no heptagons but 12 pentagons.
Although they look so different, the tubes are, in fact, much like the balls. Take a fullerene, cut it in half, and insert a cylindrical graphite section to make an enormously long carbon sausage: you have a tube. Dr Iijima's group have confirmed this by following the tubes to their extremities and finding a half-fullerene cap on the end. To the Japanese, this termination has a particularly pleasing asthetic quality. it is topologically identical to the structure of a woven bamboo basket known as a zaru. Japanese craftsmen have long known the trick of adding six pentagons in their otherwise hexagonal weave, in order to bend the material into a cupped shape. Whether similar craft can make carbon tubes useful remains to be seen."

They are things that nature already makes, provided in new abundance or tweaked in some useful way. In order to create things that nature never thought of, some biotechnologists are now trying to copy nature's method of design--natural selection--instead of its products. The idea is simple: alternating cycles of selection and amplification. Or call it trial and error. This is just what occurs naturally, as creatures breed and the fit survive. The unnatural version is, however, rather quicker.
The first product of this sort of test-tube evolution is now heading for the market. It is an anti-clotting drug made from DNA, the molecule on which genetic information is stored as sequences of chemical letters. Researchers at Gilead Sciences, a company in California, decided to use a DNA sequence as a drug in its own right, with no regard to its genetic message. They did so because DNA is easy to work with, and because it is easy to make innumerable copies of the same sequence of DNA using a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The target for their DNA was thrombin, a protein normally present in blood that plays an essential role in clotting. They threw bits of DNA--10 trillion DNA molecules with random sequences--at thrombin molecules, found the ones which stuck, copied them, and did it all again. After just five cycles, the scientists had identified 32 similar but distinct types of DNA molecule that stuck tightly to thrombin, and not to other things. From these, they chose the one sequence in 10 trillion they intend to test as a drug.
Sticking to thrombin, and stopping it from working, is not enough to make the drug a success in the clinic, admits Gilead's president Michael Riordan. The drug may prove toxic in some way, or ineffectual in the bloodstream. It is unlikely that the compound, whose first use might be in bypass surgery, could reach the market before 1997, and it could easily take much longer. The potential market, though, is vast. Optimists have already provided Gilead with a lot of money; the company raised nearly $90m in its initial offering of shares to the public in January.
Gilead's approach is intriguing, but it does not quite mimic evolution. All the variety is there at the beginning; the selection merely singles out the pre-existing best. Real evolution requires mutation, to allow one generation's best to become better. Gerald Joyce of Scripps Institute in San Diego, California, is trying to recreate that ability. Dr Joyce announced early this year that he and his colleagues had succeeded in using a molecule evolved in the laboratory to ""vaccinate"" a bacterium against infection by a phage (a virus that preys on bacteria).
Dr Joyce's ""vaccine"" is based on a molecule that cuts up a specific DNA sequence. This molecular guillotine is made out of DNA'S sister, RNA, and is called a ribozyme. Dr Joyce used a ribozyme found in a single-celled creature called Tetrahymena thermophilia; it is normally used to trim other RNA molecules, but can also, at a pinch, cut up the DNA of a phage.
Like Gilead, Dr Joyce began with lots of ribozyme molecules--something like 10 trillion. Then he selected some for their ability to cut up DNA under favourable conditions, however slowly and inefficiently. When he had found the best DNA-cutters, he introduced mutations into their structures, then copied them with a process like PCR, and selected the best again. After half a dozen generations, he says, the best ribozyme's ability to cut DNA had improved by a factor of 60. When Dr Joyce put the ribozyme most deadly to DNA into bacteria, he found that phages could no longer infect the bugs.
Ribozymes like Dr Joyce's might one day be used to protect plants or animals--or even human beings--against infection with viruses. Several difficulties would first have to be overcome. Since RNA is a very unstable molecule, the ribozymes would need a lot of protection to survive inside a cell for a long time. And though it is easy to introduce ribozymes into bacteria, getting them into the cells of large plants and animals can be difficult. Dozens of research groups around the world are currently working on just that.
Many more are looking at other ways to mimic evolution in order to make unnatural products. Natural selection may seem a cheat to scientists who want to make discoveries through sheer deductive brilliance--just as it unsettles those who want to see in the universe evidence of a conscious design. But if it delivers the goods, it will be used."

In 1950 Owen Lattimore was called the ""top Soviet spy"" in the United States by Joseph McCarthy, a senator who was building a career by finding ""traitors"" in the government. McCarthy was a rogue; at the peak of his success a lot of people in Washington knew he was a rogue and were not surprised when his defaming methods were later discredited. Yet he was believed. Millions of Americans were convinced that Senator Joe had uncovered something rotten. The cold war had been declared and the opening battles were being fought. Stalin was still alive and the Russians could any day swallow the bit of Europe they did not already have. The previous war had its Quislings, its Lavals. The new war must have some too. Lattimore could be one of them.
Robert Newman's book sets out to prove that Lattimore was a loyal American who was made a scapegoat. He proves his case easily, and could have done so in far fewer than 669 pages. But in doing so, in documenting each detail of Lattimore's career with sleuth-like persistence, he conveys, perhaps inadvertently, a feeling that Lattimore was fated to end up as McCarthy's victim. There is a growing sense of horror that the destiny of this clever, thoughtful but guileless man is going to be the inquisition.
Lattimore grew up in China. His father, a language teacher, moved his family from America to Shanghai when Lattimore was one year old. As a young man, in the 1920s, Lattimore worked for an insurance company, travelling around China, doing business and acquiring a knowledge of the country's politics, economics, banditry, landlordism and peasant unrest.
He wrote books and articles for American consumption, and built up a reputation as a China specialist. Generous hand-outs from the deep pockets of academic institutions helped him to have what seems to have been an agreeable life travelling around Asia in the 1930s. He met Mao Zedong and decided that the communists were more democratic than Chiang Kaishek's Nationalists, and that they were not mere tools of the Soviet Union. A spell at Johns Hopkins University furthered his reputation as the master-guide to China. In 1941 President Roosevelt sent Lattimore back to China to be political adviser to Chiang, in effect America's link to the Chinese government.
When in 1950 McCarthy called Lattimore ""the architect"" of America's policy in East Asia, it made a sort of sense. Americans were looking for someone to blame for the fall of China to communism the previous year. They were soppy about China, indeed still are. The American missionary was a heroic figure in books and films, converting the grateful peasant to Christian ways; America had a mission to foster the Chinese into the modern world. Americans had followed with fascination China's fight against the Japanese invaders, if only through the exploits of the Flying Tigers, a group of American mercenaries. Why had America allowed the communists to take over?
America's Asian policy had little coherence at that time, let alone an ""architect"". But someone had to be blamed. Lattimore, moving easily between the camps of Mao and Roosevelt, must be the one. Even John Kennedy found it useful in his early days as a politician to take the populist line that Lattimore had lost China to the communists. Lattimore's vast writings were examined to see whether he had written anything at anytime that coincided with communist thinking, and ""linkages"" were thought to have been spotted. Incredibly, the FBI's file on Lattimore amounted to 38,900 pages.
Lattimore's public pillorying lasted for more than five years before he was formally cleared of lying about his past. In Britain he found sanctuary and employment at Leeds University, and when he returned to America McCarthyism was over. He died at 88, a respected scholar. But the belief that he was a communist, or at least a sympathiser, persisted for many years after his McCarthyite ordeal. When the word got round that he was visiting Mongolia he was accused in an American newspaper of trying to encourage the Mongols to dominate the world, as they had under Genghis Khan. Oh my.
The trouble with America in the 1950s was not the presence of ""traitors"" in government, but that the country went through a brief and vindictive spell of panic. One consequence was that any idea which departed from orthodoxy could be construed as heretical. Not only were Lattimore and other liberals being threatened with the pyre, but many of their former colleagues shunned them for fear of being found guilty by association. This fear also permeated the far bloodier purge trials in the Soviet Union.
The American judiciary, which is slow but tends to creep to a correct decision, did eventually see off the persecutors in many of the cases, including Lattimore's. But by then the careers of some of America's best people had been interrupted, as Lattimore's was, or ruined. The human condition being what it is, these times seem bound to happen again. The public mood will be ""characterised by insanity"", as Lattimore's lawyer called the McCarthy period, and again the innocent will suffer.
Even had Lattimore been a tool of the communists, probably nothing he could have done, written or advised would have had the slightest effect on events in China. What happened there was part of what Tolstoy called the inexplicable march of history. But foolishly, and entirely humanly, it is thought necessary to blame someone for the world's misfortunes."

AGAINST EXCESS. By Mark Kleiman. Basic Books; 474 pages; $26
The mantra of America's anti-drug warriors is ""Just say no"". The message of these two thoughtful books is something much more like: ""Not now thanks, I'm driving."" Both accept that it makes no sense to discuss illegal drugs without considering the legal ones too. Both explain that each drug, legal or illegal, has its own risks. Both admit an inconvenient fact for anti-drug campaigners: most mind-changing substances are ingested for pleasure, by people who by no means make a habit of it.
The books concentrate on the domestic drug problems of the United States, which are probably worse than, and certainly different from, everybody else's. Crime in America, drug-related or not, is more lethal than in other rich countries. Matters are made worse in America by widening income disparities, by laws that make it easy to buy guns and by absurd policies on alcohol. States barely tax the stuff yet make it illegal to sell a can of beer to a 19-year-old.
Many non-Americans may be tempted to leave Americans to sort out their own mess. That is impossible. Drugs are part of the leisure and entertainment business, where the United States both sets world fashions and is the world's largest market.
Messrs Zimring and Hawkins regard drug problems as a ""chronic disease"" of American culture. They say that it cannot probably be cured, but that the harm it does might be largely reduced by fine-tuned policies that fall short of prohibition. The argument is reasonable, but applies only to America's peculiar policies and practices on drugs; outsiders can hardly join this debate, especially when it is conducted in the impenetrable jargon of sociologists.
Mark Kleiman is in a different class, thinking sharply and writing beautifully. He considers his country's problems not as a social administrator but as a puritan philosopher who, while knowing it to be impossible, would really like to do away with all mind-changing drugs, including drink, whose manifold pleasures he observes without sharing. Even the puritan Mr Kleiman cannot bring himself to see much wrong with marijuana. He commends and describes, without actually advocating, a system of ""revocable personal licences"" to buy small supplies of high-quality weed.
""One of the most important drug-policy issues"", says Mr Kleiman, ""is the level of tobacco taxes."" Dead right. Economists will enjoy, but not necessarily agree with, Mr Kleiman's intricate reasons for believing that subsidies to tobacco growers actually raise the price of the weed, so slightly reduce its consumption. They will be intrigued by the passage on markets for illicit drugs entitled ""The Multiplicative Pass-Through Model"". Mr Kleiman has reservations about it. He is, in other words, far too clever to be quite convinced even by his own best arguments, each of which, short and elegant, comes with a built-in self-refutation, to make his book an excellent if testing read.
Mr Kleiman is not impressed by the argument of this newspaper and others--that the least bad way to manage mankind's propensity for abusing the brain is by legalisation, discouragement, taxation and control. But that is the direction to which his discourse ineluctably leads."

And it is this earlier London that Peter Ackroyd evokes*--damp, decayed, and teeming with marginalised poor.
Although ""English Music"" opens in the immediate aftermath of the first world war, its atmosphere is part Dickens, part Holmes--the smell and feel of want and decay, sputtering gaslight, deep shadow, and phantasmal, flitting human presences in the streets. Its narrator, Timothy Harcombe, the son of a ""healer"" who practises his morally dubious craft of a Sunday evening in a seedy church hall, has all the impressionable fearfulness of a David Copperfield.
The young Harcombe soon discovers that he has visionary gifts of his own--in fact, his dreams are invaded by them, and these visions are often fantastic re-imaginings of the favourite stories his father reads to him at bedtime in their cramped rooms in Hackney Square: ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Robinson Crusoe"" and the tales of Sherlock Holmes.
Clement Harcombe practises his healing arts upon all who come by; and in those whom he heals he inspires a fierce loyalty, a loyalty shared by his own son who regards him as something of a god. Unfortunately, this belief does not extend as far as the child's grandparents, who remove Timothy to rural Wiltshire for the sake of the good air and the more wholesome education to be had at a local school there.
Father and son meet again, but only intermittently. The elder Harcombe's fortunes decline to such an extent that he is forced to take a job as a magician in a travelling circus; but realisation dawns upon Timothy, now grown to be a young man, that the ""magic"" practised in the past may not in fact have differed much from what his father is engaged in now.
Chapters of fantasy and reality alternate throughout the book as Ackroyd moves through the literary styles of some of his great English forebears--Defoe, Richardson, Blake and others. As in his earlier books, he is leading the reader by the hand through the English literary inheritance; but he is also reminding him that there is no such thing as a present cut off from the past. Literature and language are like sheets of tracing paper placed one upon another--every layer is visible to the naked eye if one looks hard enough.

The Russians, with all their new freedoms, are still making noisy, pessimistic films with everybody soaked in mud. The French, after their grand slam in 1991, offered little of interest this year. The Italians had one good film: Gianni Amelio's ""Il Ladro di Bambini"" (""Stolen Children""), which won the Jury Grand Prize.
The Americans and the Scandinavians brought in the largest crowds with several semi-blockbusters, headed by Robert Altman's ""The Player"". This American film, which won Mr Altman the award of best director, sticks some barbs into Hollywood and has a suitably cynical ending.
Tim Robbins, named best actor for his role as an odious Hollywood mogul in ""The Player"", had a dual role in Cannes. He was also in town as the director of his first film, ""Bob Roberts"", which attacks dirty politics as hard as Mr Altman's film attacks Tinseltown. Mr Robbins himself plays a folk singer with conservative views who runs for senator in Pennsylvania. The film follows his riotous political meeting in several brilliantly shot scenes that fill the screen with bustling, hysterical movement. The standing ovation it won was almost as noisy as the meetings in the film.
The spirit of Ingmar Bergman hovered fitfully over several Scandinavian entries that involved both players and technical crews brought up in his stables. ""Oxen"" (""The Ox""), directed and shot by Sven Nykvist, was probably the most beautiful film on show, with amazing colours and with textures which looked like 3D without the glasses. It is a study of poor people in the last century, and it centres on a man jailed for life for killing an ox. Mr Nykvist achieves a marvellous contrast between verdant country scenes and prison scenes shot in dull, metallic colours.
Mr Bergman actually wrote the script for Bille August's Danish entry, ""Den Goda Viljan"" (""The Best Intentions""), the winner of the Golden Palm for the best film. It is a portrait of Mr Bergman's parents in the early 1900s and of their complex and passionate relationship. Almost inevitably, it looks and feels a little like ""Fanny and Alexander"", with its many characters and beautiful interior decorations. Pernilla August, Bille's wife, was a worthy winner of the best actress award for her role as Mr Bergman's mother.
In every festival there is usually one film that stands out from the rest. This year it was Victor Erice's Spanish entry, ""El Sol del Membrillo"" (""The Dream of Light""), the winner of the international critics award. To say that it is mainly about an artist, Antonio Lopez, trying to paint a quince tree in his garden gives little idea of its sensual and aesthetic pleasure.
The detailed painting scenes are exquisitely framed, often interwoven with complex dissolves and fades. They draw the viewer imperceptibly into the act of creation. Toward the end, the camera moves indoors to watch the artist's wife painting a still life of Lopez, and the film concludes with magical shots of empty rooms and the darkened garden swept by wind and rains. These scenes owe something to Yasujiro Ozu, a Japanese film maker whom Mr Erice much admires. It is encouraging to learn that a British distributor has dared to take this beautiful and difficult film for commercial release."

Well born, well schooled, well tailored, well connected, and even reasonably well off, Joe Alsop looked an improbable recruit to the reporter's trade when the intervention of an august relative got him a job on the New York Herald Tribune in the depths of the Great Depression. It turned out, however, that Joe could write. To that quality he added a sharp eye, the necessary ability to tell what mattered from what did not, and the even more necessary physical stamina. So Alsop quickly became an excellent reporter, one of the best of his time, as is shown today by the irresistibly vivid, beautifully executed vignettes of Washington past that abound in this memoir of his working life.
Although Alsop cannot quite be said to have written the memoir himself, it breathes his personality, his personal as well as his writing style, to a striking degree. What happened was that when he stopped writing for publication in 1982, seven years before his death, his health deteriorated, and eventually he grew too weak for any big autobiographical effort. So he engaged a younger writer, Adam Platt, to organise his material into this book. Mr Platt has done it beautifully. The narrative starts with Alsop's childhood and ends with the death of President Kennedy, a friend to whom Alsop was devoted. After that the Alsop newspaper column continued for another nine years, an unhappy time during which the columnist, a strident supporter of the Vietnam war, found the new currents of American feeling strange and adverse. To this period the book devotes only a brief epilogue, by Mr Platt.
The narrative proper covers the Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy presidencies. It describes two points at which Alsop felt, not wrongly, that nothing would be the same again for the American nation. They were the acceptance by the Truman administration of America's leading role in world politics, and the assassination of Kennedy.
Before the second world war, as a well-placed reporter of domestic politics, Alsop could enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of a political city living its own relaxed, informal life, not yet stifled by self-importance, worries about security, featherbedding, communications technology and the elaboration of routines. In retrospect he dwells fondly on the outsized political personalities that flourished in those conditions, so unlike those candidates he saw on television in 1988, who, to him, ""all appeared to have acquired their faces and their hair from the same fashionable supplier"".
In time Peter's principle, which governs those making their way in the world, elevated the first-class reporter into a middling columnist. Between these two phases in Alsop's professional life came the second world war, which gave him his extraordinary experiences as a somewhat irregular military officer in and around China. Even in the later phase, devoted in large part to the supply of punditry on foreign, and especially East Asian, affairs, Alsop's writing came back to life when he took his typewriter out of Washington and became a reporter again. A curmudgeon in the heat of argument, Alsop in tranquillity was a warm and generous man."

Marlene Dietrich, the Prussian screen diva and husky singer most famous for her roles in films directed by Josef Von Sternberg, including ""The Blue Angel"", ""Morocco"" and ""Shanghai Express"", was returned to her home town to be buried. This represented a late change in venue. The actress, who died in her flat in Paris on May 6th at the age of 90, had said: ""I want to be buried in France, leave my heart in England, and to Germany--nothing."" Only in her final months did Dietrich change her mind.
Her rejection of Germany was reciprocated. Many Germans, particularly Berliners, resented Dietrich's ""treachery"" during the war, when she became an American citizen and starred in concerts to entertain allied forces at the front and to improve their morale. In the eyes of her critics, she added to her treachery when she returned to Berlin after the war in enemy uniform.
Many of the same people were readier to forgive Willy Brandt, a future mayor of the western part of the city, who also returned home in enemy uniform. He had, they said, made good his ""mistake"" by returning to stay. Dietrich did not. She maintained that her Germany, the one she knew and loved, had disappeared with the Nazis. When she visited Berlin in 1960 she was met by demonstrators chanting ""Marlene Go Home"". Hardly surprisingly, she never set foot in Germany again.
Even in death, the unease over Dietrich's past would not go away. Among Berliners there was a feeling of shame over the way the city had treated her. Once the news broke that the actress was to be buried in Berlin after all, the city government tried its best to make amends for past snubs.
But it became apparent that some resentment still lingers against Dietrich. Letters to newspapers questioned the right of the actress (""the foreigner"") to be buried in Berlin at all. There were reports that her open grave had been spat upon, and that neo-Nazi groups would try to break up the funeral.
Fortunately, it all went well. Dietrich gave her last performance as a true star. Her coffin was carried on an open topped black Cadillac (not a Mercedes or BMW) and traffic was brought to a stand-still. The crowds who turned out to see her final home-coming came with tokens of mourning and reconciliation.
""She was a Berliner and deserves to be buried as a Berliner,"" said one woman. ""She was right to leave Germany, more people should have done so."" The words on the wreath from the Green Party expressed much the same sentiments: ""You were the real Germany."""

""Madonna of the Yarnwinder"", a new exhibition at the National Gallery of Scotland (NGS), could change this. With five ""Leonardos"" of that name on show at the Edinburgh gallery, the question proposed by the show's curator, Martin Kemp (who is, disappointingly, neither deer-stalkered nor pipe-smoking), is a plural version of Conan Doyle's perennial question: whodunthem?
One ""Madonna of the Yarnwinder"" comes from the collection of the Duke of Buccleuch. Another belongs to the NGS. The remaining three are on loan from private collections. In the best Sherlock Holmes tradition, the answer to the question of which, if any, of the five are by Leonardo turns out to be complex.
Three of the ""Madonnas""--including, sportingly, the NGS's own--are easily dismissed as later copies. That, however, still leaves two. As would-be patrons discovered to their frustration, Leonardo was both a slow worker and prone to keep the works that pleased him when he eventually finished them. As a result, only a handful of collections can lay claim to genuine Leonardos. Even two Leonardo ""Madonnas of the Yarnwinder"" is one too many.
Mindful of this, Mr Kemp has bombarded the remaining pair--the Buccleuch and the ""Madonna"" from a private collection in New York--with the arsenal of high-tech weaponry of the modern art-historical sleuth. As he had hoped, the Buccleuch, the favourite, reveals under x-ray some signs of pentimenti: alterations on canvas regarded as typical of Leonardo's working practice. The Virgin's foot has been moved, for example, as has her thumb.
As Mr Kemp had not hoped, however, so does the New York picture: the Christ child's leg has been altered, among other things. ""The existence of two Virgins with significant penimenti is precisely not what is meant to occur,"" notes Mr Kemp. Nor does old-fashioned, eyeglass connoisseurship offer any help: the early provenance of neither picture is known, and both are stylistically convincing.
Giving the ending away may be bad form, but in this case the denouement is a happy one. Mr Kemp concludes that both ""Madonnas of the Yarnwinder"" are by Leonardo: the Buccleuch from the artist's early workshop, the more diaphanous New York picture from his later one. But the ominous word ""workshop"" itself provokes historiographic agonising.
In common with most Renaissance masters, Leonardo's brush-strokes tended to be applied by assistants. ""Are we necessarily seeking an answer to the right question?"" asks Mr Kemp. ""What do we mean by a Leonardo original?"" At what point, in other words, does a Leonardo become a ""Leonardo"", or vice versa? Not so elementary, my dear Watson."

Half a century after the second world war, people are gingerly coming to grips with the uncomfortable idea that good stuff can be produced by bad people. They are also acknowledging that not all the creative people who continued to live and work under the Nazis were wicked. Some were naive, some confused, others determined to do the best they could to sustain their country's culture in awful circumstances.
Music and history buffs are the gainers. After being thrilled by wartime records of Arturo Toscanini backing the allied cause with Verdi's ""Hymn to the Nations"" and the prisoners' chorus from Beethoven's ""Fidelio"", they are now getting a chance to hear recordings from the other side.
Some are second rate. A new collection of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra's recordings of Johann Strauss's waltzes, from Deutsche Grammophon (serial number 435 335-2), starts in the 1930s with conductors like Georg Szell and Bruno Walter, who were then bundled off to exile. Their German replacements in the war years doggedly ran through the champagne repertoire--""Light of Heart"", ""A Musical Joke"" and ""Pleasure Train""--while a dozen Jewish members of the orchestra were being sent to death camps. And EMI's recent worthy compilation, ""50 Years of Mozart Singing on Record"" (EMI CD 7637502), contains, along with more famous voices, that of Marcel Wittrisch, identified by the EMI notes as ""Hitler's favorite tenor"".
A more valuable find is a 1942-44 collection of radio broadcasts in which Wilhelm Furtwangler led the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. The records were looted by Soviet troops in 1945, and not returned until 1987. The ten compact discs (Deutsche Grammophon 427 774-2 to 427 783-2) are outstanding pieces of music. Recent biographers have concluded that Furtwangler was a just man who believed that, no matter how beastly the behaviour of the Germans under Hitler, German art would survive. He set out to save his Jewish and anti-Nazi musicians as long as he could, and to give astounding performances of Beethoven's fifth symphony (427 775-2) and of Schumann's piano concerto with Walter Gieseking as the soloist (427 779-2). A performance of the St Matthew Passion conducted by Gunther Ramin in Leipzig in 1941, which has been reprinted by Calig Records in Munich (CAL 50859/60 is another triumph.
If music under the Nazis is being re-examined, little attempt is yet being made to do the same for other arts. Peter Adam argues, in a new book*, that in looking at works of visual art produced under Hitler it is impossible to divorce aesthetics from the political context. Anyway, many of the works are not available for public view. The American government has kept 800 of the most inflammatory, confiscated after the second world war, in a Washington vault.
If the works illustrated in Mr Adam's book are a fair representation of what was produced under the Nazis, the world is not missing much. Some of the architecture Hitler admired belongs in the first rank. Some paintings, especially of people in a rural setting, would raise few eyebrows in an art gallery if they were mislabelled as Scandinavian or Dutch. But most of the pictures and sculptures Mr Adam reproduces are sentimental, unoriginal; in fact, plain dull.

* Are Germans turning away from the idea of monetary union and a united Europe?
* Will averting turmoil to the east become Germany's foreign-policy priority, at the expense of its western interests?
* Now that it is one and fully sovereign, will Germany play a bigger part in the world--in defence and at the United Nations, for example--or will internal problems ensure it keeps its head down?
BLISS IT WAS
D-mark became legal tender in East Germany. A tottering socialist economy collapsed into the arms of its rich capitalist kin. Unification was to be a corporate takeover. The turnaround needed hard, technical work of the kind Germans excel at. Producers of Mercedes and Volkswagens would soon sort out the makers of Wartburgs and Trabis. Western Germany's 61m people enjoyed a GDP per head of DM 38,000 ($23,500) a year. These could comfortably nurse along 17m easterners with a GDP per head of DM13,000 until they were able to pay their own way. Bodelsdorf would simply have to postpone that third public swimming pool. Just as envious neighbours crowed that West Germany's economy was puffed out, growth of the GDP averaging 4% a year in 1988-90 showed its formidable reserve-strength.
When five refashioned eastern Lander joined the Federal Republic of Germany on October 3rd 1990, the German Democratic Republic vanished like a pantomime dragon. From real existing socialism there was nothing, politically, to save. Western Germany could supply whatever democracy needed. No matter that many Ossi democrats proved duds. The kit came with western politicians. To eastern calls for a new constitution, there was a quick western answer. The federal republic's had worked well for 40 years. Federalism would ensure that Ossis had an eastern voice.
Foreign relations also brought a miraculous surprise. What price would the Soviet Union ask for German unity? lt had more than 350,000 troops in East Germany. Back in 1952 Stalin had wanted German neutrality. That was too high for West Germany's first chancellor, Konrod Adenauer. It would be too high for its current one, Helmut Kohl, as he at once made clear. In the event the Soviet Union meekly agreed to united Germany's membership of NATO and a full troop withdrawal by the end of 1994. In terms of a western anchor, the Germanies became one for next to nothing (though unity cost Germany a packet of aid to Russia).
A turbocharged western economy. A resilient democracy. Firm international moorings. These three things defined a fixed triangle that the addition of poor, failed East Germany was not about to bend out of shape. Uniting the Germanies meant westernising the east, not Ossifying the west.
That more or less was the view of the optimists, a tireless Chancellor Kohl at their head. In 13 whirlwind months after the Berlin Wall was opened on November 9th 1989, he fought two elections, one to persuade East German voters to back capitalism, the other to convince western Germans to support unity. He made countless visits and almost daily telephone calls to western, Soviet and East European leaders in order to win their acceptance or allay their doubts. The pace might have killed, certainly defeated, a less single-minded chancellor.
Mr. Kohl laid stress on the goal--a smoothly united Germany with ""the landscape of the new Lander in bloom"", a phrase he must now regret. He minimised the costs and the problems of reaching that goal--read my Lippen, no new taxes, a promise soon broken. But who can say that at the time he was wrong? Without his drive and confidence, Germany's historic chance might have slipped.
Even now, when one Ossi worker in three is out of a job or on short time, when Germany's budget is plunging deep into deficit and when its famous worker-management consensus is cracking, the view Mr Kohl and the optimists took remains correct--about the future. Where they economised with the truth was the cost of getting there. A sanguine view of united Germany is surely right. But there are three big qualifications.
It was a mistake to think that westernising eastern Germany could leave the western part unchanged. There is no immaculate absorption. Unity is two-way. Integrating eastern Germany means far bigger changes in the economy, institutions and attitudes of the rich part of Germany than envisaged: chances to Germany's public finances. to its vast subsidy system, to wage expectations, to welfare services, to the balance of its federal system, to the make-up of the Bundesbank, to the political parties and, if the bureaucrats of Bonn ever stir themselves, to its once and future capital, Berlin.
Second, the wider context of unity matters. The collapse of communism and the end of the cold war have rubbed out one of post-war Germany's mental gridlines. Communism, or rather anti-communism, was one of three things defining West Germany's sense of itself and its place in the world, the others being a strong democracy and a stable D-mark. For all its human and economic waste, the Iron Curtain not only comfortably froze West Germany's eastern frontier. It also saved today's Germans from decisions about the aims and uses of national power. These they must face, mostly for the first time.
Lastly, nerves count. A safe landing is hard to doubt. But many nails will get bitten on the way. Turbulence in Germany means jumpiness among its neighbours, and extra chances for misunderstanding and over-reaction. All at a time when a solid, outward-turned Germany is being looked to by its European partners (a) to provide Europe with a hard-currency discipline for monetary union, (b) to be Eastern Europe's main stabiliser; and (c) to do new peacekeeping and security jobs outside Europe.

BLISS IT WAS
But first, it bears recalling how worry-free unification looked two years ago. Only with those early hopes in mind can Germany's sweeping reaction (or is it over-reaction?) be properly gauged.
On July 1st 1990, the day of monetary union, the D-mark became legal tender in East Germany. A tottering socialist economy collapsed into the arms of its rich capitalist kin. Unification was to be a corporate takeover. The turnaround needed hard, technical work of the kind Germans excel at. Producers of Mercedes and Volkswagens would soon sort out the makers of Wartburgs and Trabis. Western Germany's 61m people enjoyed a GDP per head of DM 38,000 ($23,500) a year.

""We had one of the healthiest economies,"" says Hans Tietmeyer, the hard-headed vice-president of the Bundesbank, almost wistfully. Sometime last spring the great machine began to splutter. Unification tax rises snapped shoppers' purses shut. Recession in America and the rest of Europe shrank German exports. The backwardness and decay of the eastern economy sank in and the government in Bonn began to realise the true costs of propping it up until ""self-sustaining recovery"" could replace western hand-outs. The date for eastern take-offkept receding. The sums grew and grew.
Last year government transfers to the new Lander were around DM170 billion, and they paid roughly DM30 billion in taxes, according to the Bundesbank. Net shift to the east: DM140 billion. This year the transfers could be around DM215 billion with DM35 billion paid in eastern taxes. Net shift: DM180 billion. A bare quarter is for investment. Most is going from disgruntled Wessi taxpayers more or less directly into the pockets of hard-up Ossis, for pensions, health care, welfare or the dole. As benchmarks, DM180 billion is the equivalent of more than 6% of GNP or roughly a quarter of total public spending.
By a not-so-odd coincidence, Germany's public-sector deficit this year is expected to be around DM180 billion. This monster's size is not obvious as much of it is below water. Under Germany's thorough-going federalism, the Lander and Gemeinden (communes) account for rather more public spending than the federal government. Also, the government has put a lot of unity spending into separate funds: the Unity Eund, the Treuhand (the agency privatising state-run industries of the eastern Lander), and the debt-processing fund which took over East Germany's liabilities.
The social-security budget, expected to tip into deficit this year, as well as the new debt of the federal post office and railways, should also be counted. Those would push the total public-spending deficit in 1992 towards DM200 billion. By year end Germany's stock of public debt will be around DM1.4 trillion, 46% of GNP. If unity spending goes on at these levels, that could soar to DM1.8 trillion, or over 51% of GNP by 1995.
That would be well below the current average debt-GNP ratio of the G7 countries (60%), which is also the debt ceiling the European Community set at Maastricht as one test for joining a future currency union. But that is scant comfort if debt is growing. America may offer a warning. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, American consumers binged on imports and its government binged on weapons without the tax money to pay for them. America stopped being an overall lender of capital to the rest of the world and became a borrower. Despite Germany's strengths as an exporter and saver, if those public-debt estimates are right, Germany risks starting down America's debt road.
Oskar Lafontaine, a leader of the Social Democrats, is gloating. At the election in December 1990, he warned voters what they were in for. Just Oskar trying to spoil the chancellor's parade, people said. Perhaps he was. But Christian Democrats also began to ring the alarm. The premier of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, a transplanted Wessi, calculated that western Germany would have to transfer to the east a minimum of DM100 billion a year for ten years or more. True, Mr Biedenkopf likes tweaking the chancellor. But then the Bundesbank joined in. Its March report warned the government that big transfers to the eastern Lander could not go on without massive cuts elsewhere in public spending. It made clear that interest rates would not fall without cuts in public borrowing.
Critics say that Chancellor Kohl, worn out by the exertions of unity, missed the chance last year to dampen eastern expectations and to ask for sacrifices from westerners. After his triumph at the general election in December 1990, he did raise taxes: a temporary 7.5% surcharge on income tax (to end in mid-1992) and higher duties on insurance premiums, petrol and cigarettes. A one percentage-point rise in the top rate of VAT, to 15% from January next year, was proposed. Yet the eastern drain on the treasury was still misjudged. The chancellor beamed at the future rather than explaining the cost of Germany's ticket there.
The optimists are not without replies. Against this glum picture must be set:
* The latent strengths of the eastern economy, about to rebound with 10% growth this year (though from a collapsed floor).
* The expected pick-up in eastern tax revenues as jobs are created.
* The boost to Wessi firms from Ossi spending.
* Signs that western transfers, too massive to be spent, are going into Ossi savings.
* The danger of straight-line projection from murky data. Pundits once said the East German economy was (relatively) strong. With equal certitude they now say East German figures were sham. Cost estimates for putting the eastern economy right also need caution.
Even if all of that is true, Mr Kohl does at last seem to have accepted that paying the bill for unity cannot be postponed. Spending and subsidy cuts are in train, though securing rigour from the Lander and localities will be hard. Whether the unions have concluded the same as Mr Kohl, and whether he and Germany's bosses can hold the line on pay, is less clear. A disruptive public-workers' strike has already extracted more generous terms than the government had wanted.
The bill for unity and this year's pay claims put Germany's ""social-market"" economy on trial. This has thrived on an enlightened partnership between management and organised labour. If the German model is to survive and prosper, the government has to persuade not just public-sector but industrial workers that unity has a cost and that inflationary wage settlements will make it worse. Failure will mean higher prices and interest rates, further wage demands and more strikes. Success will make it easier for the government to tackle other public-spending lobbies and to persuade Ossis that sacrifices are needed from them too, in the form of lower wage expectations and smaller public transfers. The pain cannot be dodged. If the government does not spread it, the Bundesbank will."

The premier of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, a transplanted Wessi, calculated that western Germany would have to transfer to the east a minimum of DM100 billion a year for ten years or more. True, Mr Biedenkopf likes tweaking the chancellor. But then the Bundesbank joined in. Its March report warned the government that big transfers to the eastern Lander could not go on without massive cuts elsewhere in public spending. It made clear that interest rates would not fall without cuts in public borrowing.
Critics say that Chancellor Kohl, worn out by the exertions of unity, missed the chance last year to dampen eastern expectations and to ask for sacrifices from westerners. After his triumph at the general election in December 1990, he did raise taxes: a temporary 7.5% surcharge on income tax (to end in mid-1992) and higher duties on insurance premiums, petrol and cigarettes. A one percentage-point rise in the top rate of VAT, to 15% from January next year, was proposed. Yet the eastern drain on the treasury was still misjudged. The chancellor beamed at the future rather than explaining the cost of Germany's ticket there.
The optimists are not without replies. Against this glum picture must be set:
* The latent strengths of the eastern economy, about to rebound with 10% growth this year (though from a collapsed floor).
* The expected pick-up in eastern tax revenues as jobs are created.
* The boost to Wessi firms from Ossi spending.
* Signs that western transfers, too massive to be spent, are going into Ossi savings.
* The danger of straight-line projection from murky data. Pundits once said the East German economy was (relatively) strong. With equal certitude they now say East German figures were sham. Cost estimates for putting the eastern economy right also need caution.
Even if all of that is true, Mr Kohl does at last seem to have accepted that paying the bill for unity cannot be postponed. Spending and subsidy cuts are in train, though securing rigour from the Lander and localities will be hard. Whether the unions have concluded the same as Mr Kohl, and whether he and Germany's bosses can hold the line on pay, is less clear. A disruptive public-workers' strike has already extracted more generous terms than the government had wanted.
The bill for unity and this year's pay claims put Germany's ""social-market"" economy on trial. This has thrived on an enlightened partnership between management and organised labour. If the German model is to survive and prosper, the government has to persuade not just public-sector but industrial workers that unity has a cost and that inflationary wage settlements will make it worse. Failure will mean higher prices and interest rates, further wage demands and more strikes. Success will make it easier for the government to tackle other public-spending lobbies and to persuade Ossis that sacrifices are needed from them too, in the form of lower wage expectations and smaller public transfers. The pain cannot be dodged. If the government does not spread it, the Bundesbank will."

Of the crash's three main causes, the first was widely expected. On monetary union, Ostmarks--the East German currency--were swapped for D-marks at rates of 1:1 or 2:1 depending on the transaction. The average rate worked out at around 1.8, according to the Bundesbank. It had wanted 2:1 or 3:1, but bowed to force majeure. Add generous-seeming but job-killing wage contracts granted in the hope of stemming the flow of workers from east to west, and a lot of east German firms were paying three or four times in wages what they could hope to earn in sales. By mid-1991 many east German wages were already half of western levels. A fifth of eastern workers are on contracts that call for equal wages with western counterparts by 1994.
The second reason for collapse will be familiar to anyone who has unwrapped something as simple as an East German sugar cube: the shoddiness of most goods. The exceptions--Meissen china, Bluthner pianos, printing presses from Leipzig, railway carriages from Dessau, for example--were of no interest to everyday shoppers. Once common western wares were to be had, few Ossis wanted clumpy, badly packed eastern ones, however cheap. Wessis bought them as souvenirs.
The most devastating cause was the vanishing of foreign markets with the collapse of Comecon--the trading arrangement of Soviet and East European states which had taken about two-fifths of East Germany's exports. Horst Teltschik, Mr Kohl's former foreign-policy adviser, recalls begging East German and Russian officials to send details of export contracts so that at least some of this trade could be preserved. But amid the muddle of central planning no one at the centre had details of hundreds of separate trade deals.
NEEDED, NOT LOVED
The government points bravely to encouraging signs in the new Lander. Growth in building has picked up, and in some areas the slump in jobs may be ending. But stabilising an economy is one thing. Bringing it capitalism is another. The centre of the operation is the Treuhand, housed in Hermann Goering's old Luftwaffe building on Leipzigerstrasse in the eastern part of Berlin. In the columned lobby is a telling marriage of new and old: smiling receptionists at computer screens, and a clock without hands.
The Treuhand has more than 3,000 employees. The long white corridors look less suited to entrepreneurs than to monastic scribes or Prussian clerks. Investors complain that the Treuhand makes paperwork, foreigners say it favours Germans, unions claim that it is destroying jobs. Politicians are glad for it to take the blame.
To radical privatisers, a bureaucracy bringing capitalism to eastern Germany sounds a contradiction in terms. Guinther Rexrodt, a Treuhand director, defends the agency: ""I know of no practical or intellectually coherent alternative,"" he says. Nor, despite complaints, do most Germans.
Of its three jobs--privatising, restructuring and closing down--only the first makes money. Even here, a good price is one concern among many. The Treuhand also wants to know how many jobs and how much investment buyers will promise. The Treuhand was responsible, at the start, for 4m jobs. It has sold around 6,000 enterprises, employing 1m workers. Private investors have, the Treuhand says, pledged DM140 billion in investment. The Treuhand still has 6,000 firms on its hands; employing about 1.6m. Of these, it hopes to sell two-thirds or so. The remaining 1.4m workers out of the original 4m are, in roughly equal numbers, out of work, in re-training, in private jobs or commuting to the west for work.
The Treuhand inherited more than DM100 billion in debts on which it must pay interest. Its portfolio contains the bulkier, less attractive properties. Nobody knows how much the Treuhand may have to pay to clean up pollution left by its charges.
The Treuhand's present chief is Birgit Breuel, a the chancellor's from Lower Saxony. She took over after assassins killed Detlev Rohwedder, a former steel boss. Mrs Breuel would like to see the Treuhand's work done by 1994. The quicker it is, the sooner those debts will stop piling up.
WAITING FOR TAKE-OFF
As private industry grows, the Treuhand will occupy less of the view. Since unification some 200,000 small private firms have been started in the new Lander, despite woeful delays at the understaffed Federal Property Office in Berlin. It has a backlog of around 2.5m unsettled claims for the compensation or return of state property to previous owners. Colourful change is already apparent, much of it to do with that German obsession, the car: dealerships with fluttering pennants, petrol stations like the lobbies of expensive motels.
German industry is making this year around DM40 billion-worth of investment in the new Lander. Given predictable headaches and a poor outlook for quick profits, much of that might seem more for patriotism than for gain. Another example of the bankers, businessmen and politicians who run Deutschland Incorporated deciding what is good for Germany? The investors, who take a long view, have no doubts about profit to come.
* The car industry is in the van. Volkswagen is committing DM5 billion to a giant new plant in Saxony. Daimler-Benz plans a truck plant near Berlin. Opel will produce in Thuringia.
* BASF, one of Germany's ""Big Three"" chemical companies, has poured DM500m into modernising the Schwarzheide synthetics plant in Brandenbug and, despite early trouble, is staying. Bayer is spending the same sum on a new factory in Saxony-Anhalt.
* Heinz Durr, the bustling head of AEG who a year ago took over Germany's united and thus doubly indebted state railways, wants a free hand to modernise eastern rolling stock and track. First step: to get the railways made into a joint-stock company, though still state-owned. At present any investment of more than DM5m needs ministerial approval. Railway workers are civil servants, with special privileges and job protection.
If Mr Durr succeeds (and the Bundesrat agrees), it will be an example of something Mr Kohl's people say gets too little notice. ""Germany will be modernised from the east,"" according to Volker Kuhe, who was until April general-secretary of the Christian Democrats, is now defence minister, and would like one day to be chancellor. As an example, he cites branch banking, which in parts of western Germany sleeps on in the pre-electronic age.
There are no snap answers about western help for the eastern Lander. But these points seem clear:
(1) What counts as success in integrating the two economies must be redefined. It makes no sense to treat it as bringing average Ossi living standards up to Wessi ones in the next ten, perhaps even 20 years. If the chancellor has left the impression that this is a policy goal, it ought to be dispelled. Assume the western German economy grows in the next ten years by around 2-3% annually. The new Lander would have to grow at a stupendous yearly rate of 15% to equalise living standards. Even in the wonder decade of the 1950s, the West German economy grew by an average of ""only"" 7.5% a year.
(2) Some areas, such as Potsdam-Berlin and Dresden-Leipzig, are likely to flourish quickly, seeding other parts of eastern Germany, and making possible cuts in state transfers. But a lot of eastern Germany will stay poor and need help.
(3) Even if rapid catch-up were likely, resistance in western Germany to subsidising the new Lander would grow. Meinhard Miegel, a political economist brimming with ideas who directs the Institut fur Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft in Bonn, puts it pungently: ""Wessis go to North Africa for spring holidays and find Ossis on the beach. Lots of Ossis already have new cars. It took western Germans ten years or more after the second world war to take their first foreign holiday or get a car.""
(4) Eastern unemployment may have begun to spread the message with Ossi union branches that wage contracts guaranteeing equality with westerners regardless of productivity can destroy jobs.
(5) Fear of Ossis flooding westwards unless paid to stay put is overdone. Western union branches and Mr Kohl were at one about ""taking the D-mark to the east, not the east to the D-mark"" in the chancellor's well-known phrase. But granting Ossis equal pay may, perversely, encourage movement. Studies suggest that, in driving young Ossis to move west, the push of unemployment may matter more than the pull of high wages."

It then grew by 70% in the 1960s, 35% in the 1970s and 20% in the 1980s. At that rate, it will grow 12% in the 1990s, 7% in the first decade of the new century and then start to shrink. Economics by extrapolation is a mistake. But nor can past success be counted on to repeat itself. West Germany's economy, despite slowing growth, has performed well. Yet other economies are now getting better faster. Can Germany's next 40 years be as stable and prosperous as the previous ones?
A strict free-marketeer would declare the German economy, like the bumble-bee, theoretically incapable of flight. The bill of complaint is well-known: giant, bank-owned industries unbothered by shareholders, secure from predators and heedless of profit; an industrial base limited to heavy engineering, bulk chemicals and cars, with scant high-tech and underdeveloped financial services; well-trained and well-paid workers, who sit on oversight boards, take long, expensive holidays and expect immigrants to do the shoddy jobs; consensus and social peace bought with high taxes for a cradle-to-grave welfare system begun under Bismarck (an idea he pinched to dish the Socialists).
The German economy's riposte to this ancient caricature is to fly. Gloom about Germany's economy is cyclical. In 1975, after the first big oil-price rise, the German government was spending almost half of what Germans produced. The government deficit was around 6% of GNP, the worst in the West (save for Ireland and Italy). Inflation was an un-German 6%. Souls were searched. Helmut Schmidt, a hard-money Social Democrat, backed the Bundesbank in squeezing out inflation. Industry slashed fuel use. The reward was four virtuous years (1976-79) of shrinking government, mostly falling inflation and economic growth of near 4% a year. The misery of the early 1970s was forgotten. Brusque Mr Schmidt was hailed as a miracle-worker.
In 1979 the second oil shock brought back inflation, public deficits, slow or no growth and woe. In 1980 the economy barely grew. In 1982 it shrank by 1.1%. The liberals deserted Mr Schmidt (the anti-nuclear movement was only one of his problems). Mr Kohl became chancellor, promising a free-market Wende, or turn, that would shake up a pampered and over-regulated economy.
Since its 1988-90 spurt, health worries about Germany's economy have returned, and even more sharply with this spring's strikes. Bosses who had hoped for more swingeing free-marketry from Mr Kohl are piping up again about flagging German competitiveness: mounting labour costs, high subsidies, big government, burdensome taxes, and heavy state pension and health provision for an ageing population. Businessmen are saying that the label ""German made"" will replace ""Made in Germany"" as investment moves abroad, unless Germany becomes friendlier to business.
German bosses do not entirely blame government and workers. The big industrial firms are belatedly putting their own houses in order. The three steel giants, Krupp, Thyssen and Salzgitter, on noting that other European countries have at most one steel producer, are thinking of alliances. Krupp has already taken over Hoesch. Germany's big car makers are choosing one of two mains roads to survival in a harsher world market: diversification (Daimler-Benz and BMW) or global vehicle-maker (Volkswagen). Siemens, after a colossal management shake-out, is trying at last to live up to its name as a giant of high-tech.
Germany's machine-tool industry looks much as Germany did before Napoleon tried, with only partial success, to impose French order on its conquered principalities. There are hundreds of smallish engineering firms run by autocratic bosses who know their business to the last millimetre and pfennig. Their goods are ultra-modern and computer-guided. They cost the earth, look beautiful, arrive on time and are impeccably serviced. The snag is competitors from Asia are making cheaper equipment almost as good. The bosses of Germany's narrow-minded Mittelstand--mid-sized industry--are having to learn salesmanship. That sometimes means teaming up: not easy if distrusting your next-door competitor is second nature.
Germany's financial centre at Frankfurt is also modernising itself Unification has meant a push to find cheaper, smoother ways to market that ballooning government debt. In once-opaque markets, insider trading is now deemed scandalous and better oversight is demanded. The prospect of monetary union and a more open market in financial services across Europe is sharpening Frankfurt's urge to compete, and to be the site of Europe's central bank. It is keen, for example, to win back business in financial futures and blue-chip German securities lost to London.
THE TROUBLE WITH NOT WORRYING
A hypochondriac claims to be cured. ""You know,"" he tells his doctor with a frown, ""Sometimes I think I don't worry about my health enough."" Norbert Walter, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, has a theory that Germans thrive on creative panic. It is when they are not worried that things are bad. This is not because complacency risks nasty surprises but because it is disquiet that gets Germans going. In recent months, apprehension about Germany's competitiveness has fused with concern about Germany's public finances. If Mr Walter is right, this storm cloud of anxiety ought soon to discharge itself in action.
The costs of unity make tackling Germany's supply-side problems urgent. There are five of them.
LABOUR COSTS. On cinema screens, squeezed between ads for rum and for life insurance, viewers in Germany this spring could see a cartoon paid for by the employers' federation. As years flash by in millions, a small creature rapidly evolves as fish, reptile, ape, caveman, Goth, peasant and, finally, a carpenter. The man with the saw then strides up a red graph-line showing Germany's rocketing post-war prosperity. Around 1990 the red line flattens out, the carpenter sits down and begins to saw off the bit he is on. Early this year both public-sector and industrial unions gave notice that they wanted pay increases this year well above the 4-6% that bosses and the Bundesbank say is the limit and they made clear that they would strike to back their claims.
Bosses complain that German workers are too fond of leaving early, stretching holidays and falling sick on Fridays. Evidence for this is sketchy. But labour productivity in Germany grew by 1.6% a year in 1979-90, scarcely better than most western competitors, whom it used to outstrip. A survey published in March this year by IFO, a Munich-based research firm, suggests that many smaller manufacturing companies are less enchanted with the Standort Deutschland--the German industrial base--than they were. The change, though, seems to be that workers elsewhere in Europe work harder than before, not that Germans have got lazier. Whatever the cause, around a third of the firms polled were cutting jobs in Germany or diverting some production abroad.
SUBSIDIES. In a parting shot as France's prime minister, Edith Cresson claimed last March that German industry was now more heavily subsidised than France's. The hand-out junkies are the coal and steel industry and Germany's farmers. Subsidies for energy-saving and a clean environment are also heavy. The government once promised to take shears to subsidies, which on one reckoning are equivalent to almost 6% of GNP. It has used nail-clippers. Subsidies are regionally concentrated: industry in the Ruhr, farmers in Bavaria, which give both Social Democrats and conservatives a stake in them. The Lander subsidise to lure industry.
STATE-OWNED INDUSTRIES. The state has sold its stakes in groups such as Veba (energy), Volkswagen (cars), Viag (metals and chemicals), and Salzgitter (steel and engineering). The remaining state holdings are small. An issue made urgent by unity is the future of the ""untouchables"": the Bundespost (constitutionally protected from sale but split in 1989 into the Post, Postbank and Deutsche Telekom, which could be opened to share capital); and Lufthansa (whose government share has already dropped from 80% to 50%), and the railways.
TAXATION. Germans complain that income taxes, even after four years of cuts ending in 1990, are too high. Next to Britain's or America's, German marginal rates are steep. The public-debt monster looks almost certain to make further cuts hard, and to delay proposed cuts in corporation tax.
SOCIAL SECURITY. Contributions were due to go up even before unity. Pensions, the dole and health contributions account for around a third of wage costs. In 1965 a third of West Germans were under 25. In 2000 only a quarter will be, and a fifth of them will be over 60. Someone will have to work to pay pensions and sickness benefits. In theory, those foreigners so many Germans fear should help here. In the meantime, costs must be controlled. Unemployment-insurance premiums are being raised. Pensions are to be reckoned, from next year, on net, not gross, pay. Some free health provision is being cut. The unity crunch means more cuts to come."

Germany's financial centre at Frankfurt is also modernising itself Unification has meant a push to find cheaper, smoother ways to market that ballooning government debt. In once-opaque markets, insider trading is now deemed scandalous and better oversight is demanded. The prospect of monetary union and a more open market in financial services across Europe is sharpening Frankfurt's urge to compete, and to be the site of Europe's central bank. It is keen, for example, to win back business in financial futures and blue-chip German securities lost to London.
THE TROUBLE WITH NOT WORRYING
A hypochondriac claims to be cured. ""You know,"" he tells his doctor with a frown, ""Sometimes I think I don't worry about my health enough."" Norbert Walter, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, has a theory that Germans thrive on creative panic. It is when they are not worried that things are bad. This is not because complacency risks nasty surprises but because it is disquiet that gets Germans going. In recent months, apprehension about Germany's competitiveness has fused with concern about Germany's public finances. If Mr Walter is right, this storm cloud of anxiety ought soon to discharge itself in action.
The costs of unity make tackling Germany's supply-side problems urgent. There are five of them.
LABOUR COSTS. On cinema screens, squeezed between ads for rum and for life insurance, viewers in Germany this spring could see a cartoon paid for by the employers' federation. As years flash by in millions, a small creature rapidly evolves as fish, reptile, ape, caveman, Goth, peasant and, finally, a carpenter. The man with the saw then strides up a red graph-line showing Germany's rocketing post-war prosperity. Around 1990 the red line flattens out, the carpenter sits down and begins to saw off the bit he is on. Early this year both public-sector and industrial unions gave notice that they wanted pay increases this year well above the 4-6% that bosses and the Bundesbank say is the limit and they made clear that they would strike to back their claims.
Bosses complain that German workers are too fond of leaving early, stretching holidays and falling sick on Fridays. Evidence for this is sketchy. But labour productivity in Germany grew by 1.6% a year in 1979-90, scarcely better than most western competitors, whom it used to outstrip. A survey published in March this year by IFO, a Munich-based research firm, suggests that many smaller manufacturing companies are less enchanted with the Standort Deutschland--the German industrial base--than they were. The change, though, seems to be that workers elsewhere in Europe work harder than before, not that Germans have got lazier. Whatever the cause, around a third of the firms polled were cutting jobs in Germany or diverting some production abroad.
SUBSIDIES. In a parting shot as France's prime minister, Edith Cresson claimed last March that German industry was now more heavily subsidised than France's. The hand-out junkies are the coal and steel industry and Germany's farmers. Subsidies for energy-saving and a clean environment are also heavy. The government once promised to take shears to subsidies, which on one reckoning are equivalent to almost 6% of GNP. It has used nail-clippers. Subsidies are regionally concentrated: industry in the Ruhr, farmers in Bavaria, which give both Social Democrats and conservatives a stake in them. The Lander subsidise to lure industry.
STATE-OWNED INDUSTRIES. The state has sold its stakes in groups such as Veba (energy), Volkswagen (cars), Viag (metals and chemicals), and Salzgitter (steel and engineering). The remaining state holdings are small. An issue made urgent by unity is the future of the ""untouchables"": the Bundespost (constitutionally protected from sale but split in 1989 into the Post, Postbank and Deutsche Telekom, which could be opened to share capital); and Lufthansa (whose government share has already dropped from 80% to 50%), and the railways.
TAXATION. Germans complain that income taxes, even after four years of cuts ending in 1990, are too high. Next to Britain's or America's, German marginal rates are steep. The public-debt monster looks almost certain to make further cuts hard, and to delay proposed cuts in corporation tax.
SOCIAL SECURITY. Contributions were due to go up even before unity. Pensions, the dole and health contributions account for around a third of wage costs. In 1965 a third of West Germans were under 25. In 2000 only a quarter will be, and a fifth of them will be over 60. Someone will have to work to pay pensions and sickness benefits. In theory, those foreigners so many Germans fear should help here. In the meantime, costs must be controlled. Unemployment-insurance premiums are being raised. Pensions are to be reckoned, from next year, on net, not gross, pay. Some free health provision is being cut. The unity crunch means more cuts to come."

What tend to get forgotten are the stormy agitatos in between, no doubt because of their disturbing (and distorted) echoes of Gemmany's past. In 1949-66 conservatives governed Germany (from 1961 with the Free Democrats or liberals); in 1969-82 it was the Social Democrats' turn, in coalition with liberals from the start; conservatives returned in 1982, with the liberals again, who had once more changed sides. At either end of these stable periods came times of anxiety and upheaval. Germany is entering one such now. It should not be assumed this will last or get worse.
The government of Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first chancellor, almost fell before it got started. It went on to guide the Wirtschaftswunder, entrench the division of the Germanies and anchor the federal republic in the West. The grand coalition of conservatives and Social Democrats that followed (1966-69) was plagued by extra-parliamentary opposition from left and right as well as by the first stirrings of political terror. (So scared were Germany's main parties that in 1972, undemocratically, they banned suspected radicals from taking public jobs as teachers, engine-drivers or postmen.) Yet early in the 1970s came foreign-policy breakthrough for Germany in Europe, East and West. When the Social Democrat-led coalition came unstuck in 1982 after a serious recession, Germany was a battleground between green-clad policemen and anti-nuclear demonstrators. Was Germany turning neutral? Had it lost its will? With there turn of prosperity and detente, the peace campaigners were as forgotten as the NATO missiles they opposed.
The players in Germany's current political bank are out of key. The coalition of Christian Democrats and liberals, which has governed since 1982, is openly strained. The Social Democrats, who dominate the upper house, have taken to harrying and delay, especially on matters concerning the Lander (just about anything these days) and on constitutional questions. Politics in the eastern Lander is preoccupied with the past. Three of four Christian Democrat premiers in the new Lander are Wessis. The one Social Democrat is an Ossi, Manfred Stolpe, the premier of Brandenburg, and he is under a cloud for self-confessed links with the Stasi. In western Germany, the Christian Democrat loss in Baden-Wurttemberg left only their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, in clear control in any of the 11 old Lander. Mr Kohl's popularity is at a low. Not surprisingly, Bonn has frothed for weeks with the question of whether Mr Kohl's government could survive until the general election due in 1994 or whether it was not time for a grand coalition.
It is not just because the national soccer team must defend the World Cup in two years' time that 1994 is a big year for Germans. The parliament will choose Germany's president in May. Elections for the European parliament follow in June. Then comes a general election in the autumn. The five new Lander as well as Bavaria, Berlin and Lower Saxony will hold state elections in the course of the year. In January--assuming due ratification of the Maastricht agreement--the second stage of Europe's monetary union will have begun. The D-mark and Germany's public borrowing will be under watch by monetary officials of the European Community. In the second half of 1994 Germany will take over the six-month presidency of the EC from Greece. The main agenda, as the German government sees it: empowering the European Parliament and devising a European foreign and defence policy. It makes Mr Kohl's unity year look easy.
ANNUS MIRABILIS OR HORRIBILIS?
Between now and then is a pause with no big election on the calendar, which Mr Kohl's advisers candidly describe as his make-or-break chance. Germans will always remember him as the chancellor of unity. They may yet boot him out because of the bill--if he does not meanwhile declare victory and take a statesmanlike retirement from German politics. To hope for survival and re-election, the Christian Democrats have a daunting list of chores. These are to:
* Grapple with Germany's public-finance mess, probably with the Social Democrats' help.
* Handle pay strikes in the western Lander and unemployment marches in the new ones.
* Attend to the alienation and sense of defeat in the New Lander. Mr Kohl, like nearly everyone else, expected eastern Germany to be Social Democratic soil. In 1990 Ossis thumpingly backed the conservatives. Four of the five new Lander have Christian Democrat premiers. A stinging backlash could come in 1994.
* Answer public fears about the flood of refugees into Germany, one reason for the success of far-right extremists at state elections in the Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein in April.
* Push through changes to the Bundesbank required by German unity and by economic and monetary union (EMU) in Europe.
* Steady wavering German support for the EC and shepherd the parliament towards ratification of the Maastricht agreement by the year's end.
* Open a national debate about a new federalism. In 1995 there must be a new Finanzausgleich, which redistributes public money from rich to poor Lander. This ""revenue-sharing"" is the financial heart of German federalism. Unity means it must be completely re-worked.
* Be ready for trouble beyond Germany's eastern borders. A soldiers coup in Poland? The stormy break-up of Czechoslovakia?
* Rely less on Germany's chequebook in foreign policy and get the constitution changed to let German soldiers take part in military or peacekeeping operations outside Germany's NATO area.
Given this list, Mr Kohl's government could use help. The hard issues--taxes, public spending, subsidies, refugees, Europe--cut across party lines and the drawbacks of a grand coalition--a formal alliance between Christian and Social Democrats--may be greater than the advantages. Yet, in whatever form, the government probably does need the co-operation of the Social Democrats. Whether it can really count on it is another question.
Like most European parties of the left (Spain's Socialists may be an exception), Germany's Social Democrats have lost their way. Who really leads them is anybody's guess. Their best hope for power, many argue, is a conservative fiasco. Why rescue Mr Kohl? On the other hand, pressure for consensus in Germany is strong, especially at a time like the present. The deputy leader of the Social Democrats, Wolfgang Thierse, a quiet, red-haired Ossi, insists that his party will not play the spoiler.
BIG PARTIES UNDER PRESSURE
Small parties have been eating into big ones for some time. In 1980 the main three parties got 98% of the national vote. In 1990 they got 88%. That may not seem much. But in German politics, even decimals matter. A decade ago, 60% of voters were loyal to one party or another. Only 24% were floaters, switching from election to election. Now 44% are committed and 43% float.
The Social Democrats are the most obvious victims. They won a record 45.8% of the vote in 1972 and, aside from a tiny increase in 1980, have lost ground ever since. In 1990 they won 33.5%, perilously close to the 30% bar below which voters may decide a party is not a primary challenger for power. Mr Lafontaine's febrile search for new ideas mainly underscores the party's lack of them. Like other left-wing parties in Europe, it long ago became a party not so much of the industrial working class as of teachers and public officials.
This all might matter less if the party could hit on an appealing candidate. Worthy Johannes Rau, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, tried and failed (1987). Next came Mr Lafontaine, bravely recovered from an assassination attempt (1990). Some colleagues, tired of Mr Lafontaine's Gallic cleverness (he is premier of Saarland, which borders France), prefer Bjorn Engholm, premier of Schleswig-Holstein. Seldom without a pipe, he exudes Baltic earnestness. The snag is he does not look a sure vote-winner. In the Land election last month, his party held its majority by one seat.
Lack of fresh talent afflicts the liberals and the Christian Democrats as well. Though small in number, the liberals are, or at least see themselves as, a fixture. Their share of the vote has ranged from 12.8% in 1961 to 5.8% in 1969, when they almost failed to clear the 5% threshold for winning seats in parliament. They lost ground in the 1980s, undercut in part by the Greens, who favour a more environment-friendly and less materialistic life. But the liberals rebounded in 1990, winning 11%.
Two things have helped them survive. One is mixed parentage. The Free Democrats combine two strains in German liberalism: laisser-faire economics on the one hand, and anti-militarism and social reform on the other. This makes them an ideal swing party, able to ally with right and left. Purists despise them. But many Germans see them as essential to temper the power of their bigger rivals. Despite strains with the conservatives, the liberals and Social Democrats would not make a majority in the present Bundestag. After the next election, they might join up once more.
But do the liberals have the candidates? Their other secret has been strong and enduring leaders: Hans-Dietrich Genscher, foreign secretary for 18 years and Germany's most popular politician, and Otto Lambsdorff, an ex-economics minister and formidable orator. Mr Genscher, 65 and in less than perfect health, stunned everyone by announcing at the end of April that he would resign within the month. Even before this news rocked the party, there was talk that Count Lambsdorff might soon step down as party chairman. Evidence that both Mr Genscher and Count Lambsdorff are tired was Mr Genscher's bungled succession. Liberal members of parliament rejected as foreign minister Mr Genscher's hand-picked successor and chose instead Klaus Kinkel. Another coming man, who has taken Mr Genscher's other job as deputy chancellor, is Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister. He is an ex-teacher with a flair for publicity and parachuting. Colleagues wonder if he has the gravitas.
The Christian Democrats' leader, by contrast, seems not to need a parachute. He has walked off cliffs and never fallen, at least till now. An old party boss from the Rhineland-Palatinate, Mr Kohl combines the job of chancellor and party chairman. Despite his triumphs, the party is restless. It has lost members. As a patronage machine, it is failing grossly to deliver in the western Lander. Under Mr Kohl, it has won three general elections in a row. But its national share of the vote has fallen each time. The lack of visible heirs is not itself a safety net for Mr Kohl. Until Margaret Thatcher went, who outside Britain had heard of John Major? Besides Volker Ruhe, the other man who would like Mr Kohl's job is Wolfgang Schauble, the Christian Democrats' leader in the Bundestag. An attack by a deranged gunman put him in a wheelchair, probably for life, but did not dull his combative edge.
THE GOBLINS OF EXTREMISM
The far-right Republicans, led by an ex-ss officer, Franz Schonhuber, shocked Germany in 1989 by winning seats in the Berlin senate. Then they faded. German unity, it was said, had been achieved without ugly nationalism. This was spoken too soon. In Bremen last September, the anti-foreigner Deutsche Volksunion (German People's Union) campaigning on the slogan ""Germany for the Germans"" won 6.2%. In Baden-Wurttemberg last month, the Kepublicans won 10.9% of the vote and in Schleswig-Holstein the German People's Union got 6.3%.
Mr Kohl's government called it a protest vote about the large number of refugees claiming political asylum in Germany. In a sense it was. Yet anything that smacks of nationalism, let alone fascism, echoes louder in Germany than elsewhere. These results also expressed fears and resentments about German unity and European union: West Germany was voiceless but at least cosy; now the cosiness has gone and, having got back its voice, Germany is at once going to lose it again in a chorus of Latins and Englishmen.
Germany's constitution guarantees asylum to the victims of oppression. Refugees are admitted without question at the frontier. Courts then hear their cases. They reject all but around 5%. Yet, once in, many refugees stay, though nobody knows how many. It is the entry numbers that make headlines. Last year alone more than 250,000 asylum-seekers, including 75,000 from Yugoslavia, 40,000 from Romania and 24,000 from Turkey, came to Germany. More are expected this year.
Without much success, the government is trying to speed up the review procedures. It wants asylum applications made before refugees board aircraft bound for Germany, but there are legal problems. It has sought support from Social Democrats, so far refused, to refine the constitutional protection of refugees. This is to appease the right and to bring German law into line with the Schengen agreement on internal European frontiers, which involves not accepting refugees whom others refuse.
The row over asylum-seekers masks a deeper issue, Germany's tangled ideas on immigration. In this it is not alone. But it makes things harder for itself in defining nationality by ancestry. This is sometimes explained by geography: Germany, which borders nine nations, has no natural frontiers with which to distinguish itself. Yet making kinship rather than place of birth or voluntary decision a test of citizenship has odd consequences. A Russian who speaks no German but whose grandfather was German has a right to return to Germany to live as a citizen. A Turk who has lived, worked and paid taxes in Germany for years and who is fluent in German, is, in the eyes of the law and of most Germans, a foreigner (although the rules have been relaxed to allow certain foreigners who have lived in Germany for 15 years or more to become citizens if they apply before 1995).
Defining citizenship principally by blood is not, as often implied, a peculiarity of central European tribalism. Ireland and Italy, for example, define nationality in the same way. Where Germany differs is in the large number of ethnic Germans who want to come to live there and in the even larger number of well-rooted non-Germans who already do but who are not accepted as citizens. Last year almost 150,000 people claiming German ties settled from the ex-Soviet Union and 40,000 from Poland. In West Germany in 1989 there 5m foreigners all told. Like Ossis they need to be better integrated into German society than most of them are. But as non-citizens many must also feel they have fallen again to the bottom of the pile.
Neo-Nazi skinhead gangs, meanwhile, have attacked refugee hostels in eastern and western Germany. The authorities are trying to protect refugees in wired-off, barracks-like housing, which reminds some people of concentration camps.
In thinking about the German far right it is hard to steer between emollience and over-excitement:
--One voter in ten on a low turn-out in a state election is not an electoral earthquake.
--Perhaps not. But remember what the French neo-fascist, Jean-Marie Le Pen says: his supporters speak aloud what others think.
--That's what extremists always want thought, and what the mainstream ought never to fall for. Besides, it's Austria, not Germany, where a handsome neo-fascist--Jorg Haider--is riding high.
--Wasn't Hitler Austrian? Anyway, you must have heard of Ewald Althans, a 25-year-old German? He says, ""I need no gun; I am the weapon,"" and aims to unite Germany's neo-Nazis.
--Well, now I have. But, if he wants to get anywhere, first he'll have to change his name.
--Just like Hitler did.
--Now you're not being serious.
Mr Schonhuber claims that in 1994 the Republicans will clear the 5% bar and win seats in the Bundestag. As the far right has never done so, this sounds an idle boast. The Greens, by contrast, do look likely to return to parliament. Mr Manfred Lahnstein, a former Social Democrat minister and now a director of Bertelsmann, Europe's (and maybe the world's) biggest media and publishing group, has a wise word on Germany's moody political climate: ""It's not two or three thousand skinheads that bother me,"" he says, ""It's Germany's middle class if they lose confidence in the money in their pocket."""

Last year alone more than 250,000 asylum-seekers, including 75,000 from Yugoslavia, 40,000 from Romania and 24,000 from Turkey, came to Germany. More are expected this year.
Without much success, the government is trying to speed up the review procedures. It wants asylum applications made before refugees board aircraft bound for Germany, but there are legal problems. It has sought support from Social Democrats, so far refused, to refine the constitutional protection of refugees. This is to appease the right and to bring German law into line with the Schengen agreement on internal European frontiers, which involves not accepting refugees whom others refuse.
The row over asylum-seekers masks a deeper issue, Germany's tangled ideas on immigration. In this it is not alone. But it makes things harder for itself in defining nationality by ancestry. This is sometimes explained by geography: Germany, which borders nine nations, has no natural frontiers with which to distinguish itself. Yet making kinship rather than place of birth or voluntary decision a test of citizenship has odd consequences. A Russian who speaks no German but whose grandfather was German has a right to return to Germany to live as a citizen. A Turk who has lived, worked and paid taxes in Germany for years and who is fluent in German, is, in the eyes of the law and of most Germans, a foreigner (although the rules have been relaxed to allow certain foreigners who have lived in Germany for 15 years or more to become citizens if they apply before 1995).
Defining citizenship principally by blood is not, as often implied, a peculiarity of central European tribalism. Ireland and Italy, for example, define nationality in the same way. Where Germany differs is in the large number of ethnic Germans who want to come to live there and in the even larger number of well-rooted non-Germans who already do but who are not accepted as citizens. Last year almost 150,000 people claiming German ties settled from the ex-Soviet Union and 40,000 from Poland. In West Germany in 1989 there 5m foreigners all told. Like Ossis they need to be better integrated into German society than most of them are. But as non-citizens many must also feel they have fallen again to the bottom of the pile.
Neo-Nazi skinhead gangs, meanwhile, have attacked refugee hostels in eastern and western Germany. The authorities are trying to protect refugees in wired-off, barracks-like housing, which reminds some people of concentration camps.
In thinking about the German far right it is hard to steer between emollience and over-excitement:
--One voter in ten on a low turn-out in a state election is not an electoral earthquake.
--Perhaps not. But remember what the French neo-fascist, Jean-Marie Le Pen says: his supporters speak aloud what others think.
--That's what extremists always want thought, and what the mainstream ought never to fall for. Besides, it's Austria, not Germany, where a handsome neo-fascist--Jorg Haider--is riding high.
--Wasn't Hitler Austrian? Anyway, you must have heard of Ewald Althans, a 25-year-old German? He says, ""I need no gun; I am the weapon,"" and aims to unite Germany's neo-Nazis.
--Well, now I have. But, if he wants to get anywhere, first he'll have to change his name.
--Just like Hitler did.
--Now you're not being serious.
Mr Schonhuber claims that in 1994 the Republicans will clear the 5% bar and win seats in the Bundestag. As the far right has never done so, this sounds an idle boast. The Greens, by contrast, do look likely to return to parliament. Mr Manfred Lahnstein, a former Social Democrat minister and now a director of Bertelsmann, Europe's (and maybe the world's) biggest media and publishing group, has a wise word on Germany's moody political climate: ""It's not two or three thousand skinheads that bother me,"" he says, ""It's Germany's middle class if they lose confidence in the money in their pocket."""

For a defeated, divided and semi-sovereign country, the appeal of a united Europe was obvious. German aggression started, or helped start, three European wars between 1870 and 1945. What better way than the European Community to bind Germany to its neighbours, to calm their fears of future aggression and to re-channel German national pride?
When, in the 1950s, Adenauer pressed for European unity, the Social Democrats at first resisted. European unity, they feared would surely put paid to the German sort. When hope of unifying Germany became a piety, Social Democrats, too, embraced the EC. Unlike the British, who have quarrelled about the Community since it began, Germans, right and left, have taken it for granted--until now. Is sovereign Germany turning its back on the Community?
As a trio of world powers, most Europeans would prefer America, Japan and the EC to America, Japan and Germany. So, despite the worries, would most Germans. Opinion polls suggest neither a swing away from the EC nor unquestioning support. Germany's federal system makes it easier for Germans than for citizens of centralised Britain and France to grasp what the next steps towards a more federal Europe, due after 1996, really mean.
Yet the prospect of actually taking them was bound to provoke reaction and doubt. The government is going to have to explain, really for the first time, why European unity is in Germany's national interest. That is no bad thing. The question is not ""Germany in the new EC or out?"", but how Germany will use its weight within and what kind of Community it will be.
To Mr Kohl and Mr Genscher, German unity made the European sort all the more urgent: to allay British and French fears, to offer a mooring for the new eastern democracies and to give unified Germany itself an unambiguous framework. The first western leader Mr Kohl told about his breakthrough on German unity with Mikhail Gorbachev in February 1990 was the president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors. In the run-up to Maastricht, the Germans forced the pace. Britain and France hesitated.
Concerns in Germany about the EC are not new. They are simply getting a fuller hearing. Besides the fate of the D-mark, these include the EC's budget, of which Germany pays 28%. One way to slash costs (and improve the EC's relations with America) would be to limit or scrap farm subsidies. But Germany's farmers, thanks to a constituency carve-up favouring the countryside, speak louder than their numbers merit. Another German fear is that cheaper, dirtier EC countries will steal away investment and jobs--though when examples are asked for, faces normally go blank.
To those in charge of Germany's European policy, the timetable looks as follows. Barring accidents, parliament will ratify the Maastricht agreement by the end of the year. Under pressure from the Lander, it may attach a rider asking for a second look in 1996--the moment for the EC's next big leap forward. In early 1993 Austria, Finland and Sweden will negotiate to join. A ""small"" institutional fix will be needed. When votes in the council of ministers are re-jigged, Germany, as now, will have the same voting strength as Britain, France and Italy. The European Parliament, being representative is different. When its seats are shared out anew, Germany, because of its size, will for the first time get more seats than the other big three--assuming France agrees. The EC will then prepare for Maastricht II, in 1996.
By then, it is hoped, the security job the EC seeks will be clearer, and hoary NATO problems can be finessed. France will have drawn closer to NATO, as Europe does more of NATO's work and American troops in Germany dwindle (without disappearing). The heart of this will be military co-operation between the French, Germans and British. After Maastricht II, rich westerners who missed the first chance to join an expanded EC will apply. So will the less indigent East Europeans--assuming they are still democracies.
Too tidy? No doubt. But Germans prefer overneat timetables to none at all. With that calendar or something like it few mainstream German politicians would disagree. Anti-European backwoodsmen in Mr Kohl's party are currently a minor threat. The liberals will presumably continue to tread in the steps of Mr Genscher, Germany's leading European patriot. Even the Social Democrats are coming round. Mr Lafontaine's recent effort to rally them against the Maastricht agreement was an embarrassing flop. An element of faith does colour the attitudes of older German leaders to the EC. Younger politicians are less respectful and more questioning. But, twisting though it is, most Germans see no alternative to the Community road.
THE DARK EASTERN WOODS
What Germany's western friends often perversely see as a choice--ties with them or ties with the East--is for Germany no choice at all. It needs both. Those anxiously recalling the pacts which Bismarck (Imperial Germany), Stresemann (the Weimar republic) and Ribbentrop (Nazi Germany) struck with Russia can put their diplomatic histories away. Today's German government insists that the framework for its ties with the East must be the West's two main alliances, the EC and NATO. Coping with the East, that is, cannot be allowed to weaken Germany's friendship with France or America. That sounds fine. But can this complex equation really be solved?
The East may appear to others to be Germany's sphere of influence. To Germans in glum moods it looms more as a source of chaos, cash demands and refugees. That is why Mr Kohl's government thinks that East Europeans must urgently be made to feel sure of a place in the Community. As with Spain and Portugal in the 1970s, the idea is to steady frail democracies with the clear target of membership, even if actually joining takes a long time. The German government makes a strict geographic divide. Europe, in its eyes, stops at the Bug river--Poland's border with the Ukraine--and, bar perhaps the Baltic states, the countries of the ex-Soviet Union are not candidate Europeans.
To the question whether the EC could survive this widening in recognisable form, there is in the chancellor's office a confident answer: the EC will become more a cluster of well-linked clubs, like the interlocking rings on the Olympic flag, than a castle surrounded by outlying circles of applicants and associates. Easterners need not wait for full membership to be involved. One idea, for example, would be to draw Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland into EC foreign-policy discussions.
Germany's presence in the East is everywhere visible. Since 1989 Germany alone has provided Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union with more than half the West's aid and is the region's biggest foreign investor. German constitutional lawyers, churches, political parties and language institutes are also involved. So are the Lander: for example, Bavaria with Bohemia, and Saxony with Silesia. Set against Germany's western interests, this is trifling. More than two-thirds of Germany's exports go to West European countries or America. Last year it sold to all of Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union as much as it sold to Austria. Figures like that do not calm western worriers. In 20 years, when the benefits from the East flow, will Germany still care about the West?
HAVING IT BOTH WAYS
Germans are used to feeling damned if they do and damned if they don't. Germany is pressed to do more in the world. When it does, ugly-stepsister allies accuse it of assertiveness. Recent examples? Germany's push for European recognition of Croat and Slovenia or last December's jump in German interest rates. When Germany does not act--as in the Gulfwar--its allies complain of introversion.
Nor is it only allies who complain. Germans themselves are arguing about these things, as they have done for years. But now Germany is free to act. Or is it? External constraints on the use of national power are gone. Internal--legal and, more importantly, mental--ones remain. The government, for example, wants a constitutional change allowing German soldiers to be sent for peacekeeping or military uses outside NATO countries, as America and Britain would like, and faces opposition from Social Democrats, who would prefer them sent only for peacekeeping. On the other hand, the government seems reluctant to press for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. It does not want to displace Britain and France or close off the chance of an EC seat (distant as that may look). Yet, as the UN's say grows, Germany's absence from its top body will look ever odder."

Foreign visitor: ""That sounds like German perfectionism. Think of France's problems, or Britain's."" Noted editor, with a sharp laugh: ""We don't compare Germany to Britain."" Finding a yardstick for Germany is hard, and not just for foreigners. In the tale of the Schonleben household, which of the five villains are stage ones and which real?
Unity costs. Modernising the eastern Lander is a passing burden that will become a lasting one if Germany fails to tackle its public-sector deficit: by cutting subsidies, limiting new spending and improving the cost-efficiency of its welfare services. This means reform, not revolution. At the same time, westerners cannot be made to take the whole burden. Eastern expectations must also be lowered.
Germany needs a new Finanzausgleich or federal revenue-sharing in 1995. The current system would leave poor western Lander subsidising eastern ones. This may be the moment to re-draw Germany's federal map, creating fewer, more balanced Lander. One idea, due to Meinhard Miegel, is shown in the map on the right.(Map omitted) There may be others. Stronger eastern Lander with revived, historic cities could be a source of Ossi pride.
The end of East Germany was a relief, but also a defeat. Wessis are scathing about eastern gaucheness, slowness and conformity. Ossis speak with bitter humour of living in a Besetzungszone, an occupation zone. Money is not all that is needed to bring eastern and western Germany together. Symbols and people matter. Delay in moving the government to Berlin, for example, is a false saving. It should get there fast, and the city should find a dynamic mayor. More eastern faces at the top of Germany's parties--an Ossi president in 1994 even--would also help. The hounders of Ossi politicians who, like the vast majority of their fellow countrymen, chose prudence over valour in dealings with the Stasi will, it must be hoped, soon tire.
Xenophobia and the far right. The Germans running Germany grew up in the shadow of what their parents and grandparents condoned. Their history gives them direct knowledge of where nationalism and racism can lead. Germany-firsters and neo-fascists are a minority. But xenophobia may spread unless big parties persuade its sufferers, on the one hand, that Germany's borders are not an unpoliced sieve and, on the other, that keeping out all foreigners, even if possible, would be wrong.
Europe, the East and the wider world. Most Germans see no alternative to the EC. But they are more open than before about how it grows from here. They do not want to be its milk-cow. Germans, like others, resent being made the object of special burdens and impositions.
Nor do they want to be made to choose between Eastern and Western Europe or between France and America. Geography condemns Germany to face several ways. Americans of all people should understand this. German eagerness to make its eastern approaches through its western alliances could weaken unless its western friends pay more of the eastern bills. At the Munich summit of the rich G7 countries in July, where Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union will be the main issue, a new burden-sharing argument may emerge: who in the West does most to help the East? In time Germany is likely to be ready to use its troops outside Europe: first for humanitarian missions, then for peacekeeping, and last for military operations sanctioned by the United Nations. Hectoring from NATO allies will not really speed this process up.
Predictions about Germany before unity were so wildly wrong that judgments about it now, including these ones, must be handled with care. The source of uncertainty, though, needs pinpointing. Sovereign Germany is going be less reticent and less tactful. This does not mean it will be less predictable. The division of Germany resulted from Hitler's war and Stalin's victory. Its unification came about because communism fell, a chain of events begun in Moscow, not in Berlin or Bonn.
That collapse has created a vacuum in the East whose consequences westerners are only beginning to glimpse, though Germans quicker than most. Nobody can be sure how an international framework created for a divided Europe will serve the new one. Yet those who liken Germany's place in Europe now to its position in 1871 or 1919 miss crucial differences. Germany then was either undemocratic or aggrieved, and nuclear weapons had not been invented. The present generation of Germans are keener to be creators than upsetters of a rich and stable continent."

While they are at the Earth summit, they will sign a treaty on climate change, better known as global warming. They will hail this as a triumph. In fact, the treaty is deflecting attention from other, more mundane problems that have been around for longer and do more damage to development and the environment than global warming is likely to do. The most crucial of these is population growth, an issue on the fringes of the Rio agenda.
One reason for this neglect is that global warming is fashionable, and tantalising. Five years ago only a handful of meteorologists had heard of it. Now its complex causes and uncertain effects intrigue scientists of every stripe (see our survey after page 54). Besides, some environmentalists appear to see in global warming the revenge they have long expected nature to take on humanity for economic growth and technology. On the whole, rich countries have managed to make their environments cleaner and safer while growing ever richer. Now, argue gleeful greens, the limits to growth are at last in sight.
In fact, the main certainty about global warming is that its consequences are uncertain and far off, whereas the measures needed to prevent it are immediate and (in some cases) costly. But much of the damage that could result from climate change in the next century is occurring right now, and it has nothing to do with carbon dioxide. Deserts are advancing, forests are vanishing, crops are failing, species are becoming extinct. The root cause of this damage is a combination of population growth and poverty in the third world. These are the gravest threats to environment and development, the twin themes of the Earth summit. Tackling them matters far more for man's future than preventing global warming.
BEGIN AT HOME
Population growth can be slowed down only if the countries in which it is occurring are persuaded that it is a bane, not a boon. Some are still ambivalent, as are those western economists who argue that more people will bring more investment and innovation, just as they did in Victorian times. Such arguments misunderstand the scale and speed of what is happening.
By the middle of the next century, world population will almost certainly have doubled. Before it eventually levels off, it may have quadrupled. Most of these extra people will be crowded into the third world, mainly in the countries that already find it hardest to provide food, water, jobs and health care for their people. By 2050 Bangladesh, which now has 113m people, may have 245m. Its population density, already almost double that of Holland, would then be 1,700 people per square kilometre (4,400 per square mile). Nigeria, with roughly the same population as Bangladesh today, may have about 440m people by mid-century.
Countries that are rich and skilfully run can accommodate large populations, living cheek by jowl. But apart from a few city-states--Singapore, Hong Kong, Bermuda--no society has ever managed people living as tightly packed as the citizens of Java or Rwanda will be in 60 years' time. Today only a handful of countries (South Korea, Holland, Bangladesh) have more than 400 people per square kilometre. By the middle of the next century, as the World Bank's latest World Development Report points out, one-third of humanity will probably live in countries with these densities. Many of them will be crammed into cities that will make today's versions seem almost cosy. Keeping these monsteropolises quiet will become the main preoccupation of third-world politicians.
Rapid population growth is a brake on economic development. For example, if Nigeria is to provide all its people with clean drinking water by 2030, it must quadruple the number of connections to the water supply in cities and increase them almost ninefold in the countryside. If Indians are to increase the amount of cereal they eat by 40%, taking them up to a decent diet, they will have to quadruple the amount of fertiliser they use. Crop yields can be increased enough in most countries to provide people with as much to eat as they have now, but only if irrigation, fertilisers and farming techniques are applied at least as efficiently as in America. A few countries will not have even that option. Bangladesh will get enough food only if, like Hong Kong, it converts its peasants into factory workers and becomes in effect the world's largest city-state.
Population growth also threatens the environment. As numbers increase, traditional farming methods become corrupted. Land can no longer be left fallow between crops; cultivation extends up fragile hillsides, so the rain floods down and the soil erodes; the forests, grasslands and swamps in which the world's dwindling wildlife survives are cleared, whether or not they can sustain agriculture. An estimated 60% of third-world deforestation is caused not by logging but by land-hunger. Population pressure will confront many poor countries with a choice between (a) using farmland more intensively, which involves the risk of pesticide pollution and soil exhaustion; and (b) using more land, which carries the risk of desertification (an ugly word for an ugly business).
Yet many third-world leaders are wary of first-world efforts to persuade them to curb fertility. They suspect that the affluent north is mainly terrified by the prospect of hordes of swarthy immigrants, and more concerned for the future of the elephant than for the lives of black and brown babies. Even if that were true, third-world governments have a duty to their own citizens to give them the same right to choose the size of their families as people in rich countries already enjoy.
At present, roughly 300m couples worldwide say they want family-planning services but cannot get them. In Bolivia and Ghana, for example, 35% of couples complain that they do not have the contraception they want. Simply by providing a more user-friendly and reliable service, fertility can be reduced. It is particularly important to offer privacy, confidentiality and security of supply. In Kenya, the provision of a much better service has boosted the use of contraception from 17% of couples to 27% in a mere five years; in Bangladesh, the result has been a two-point fall in the fertility rate, with two-fifths of Bangladeshi couples using contraceptives.
But access to contraception is not the only determinant of family size. Japan's contraceptive use is roughly that of Costa Rica; its fertility rate is less than half. In the mid-19th century fertility in America, where land was plentiful, was one-third higher than in France, where the law divided farms into ever-tinier holdings. Though contraception matters, so do attitudes. For people to want to have fewer children, the incomes of the poor must increase and child mortality must decline.
Above all, women need schools and jobs. Studies by the World Bank have shown that, when women have no secondary education, they have on average seven children; if even 40% of women have been to secondary school, family size drops to three children. Better-educated women have healthier babies, too. If they are farmers, they are better at managing the environment on which their livelihoods depend. And they are more likely to find employment, financial independence and thus the sexual independence they need to decide how many babies to bear. Educating women may be less intellectually challenging than keeping the planet cool, but few investments do more for development and the environment."

Suddenly, after nearly a year of war in the Balkans, the outside world is starting to talk tough to Serbia. A fortnight ago the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution instructing Serbia to withdraw its forces from Bosnia & Hercegovina. In Lisbon last weekend James Baker, the American secretary of state, said that anyone arguing against outside action to stop the war was ""on the wrong wavelength"". On May 25th John Major, the British prime minister, said plainly for the first time that Serbia was to blame for the continued fighting. The European Community and the United Nations are drawing up plans for trade sanctions against Serbia (see page 49). If these fail, Mr Baker says, it could become necessary to consider military measures as well.
All this may seem a little late. The fighting has already killed at least 6,000 people and turned more than 1m into refugees. Where Yugoslavia used to be, four new countries--Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia & Hercegovina--have acquired or will soon acquire their own flags and seats at the United Nations. A fifth, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, claims to be the lawful successor to the old Yugoslavia. But this fifth bit is different. The other four were willing to inherit the borders they had when they were separate republics in a federal state. Serbia is the base from which ex-Yugoslavia's biggest tribe uses its military power to grab as much land as it can. Why have the Serbs been allowed to get away with it?
The short answer is that no other country or group of countries has cared enough about the Balkans to risk intervening in the one way that might have brought about a decisive end to the present fighting: that is to say, with overwhelming military force. As a result, the world has looked on impotently while the Serbs bombarded first Vukovar, then Dubrovnik and now Sarajevo. The war has cruelly exposed the flaws and weaknesses of the European Community, the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe, NATO, the United Nations and all the other institutions that have been tempted this past year to set themselves up as guardians of international peace and the new world order. What a contrast to the terrible swift sword that fell upon Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. And no wonder more and more people have started to demand a replay of Desert Storm in the Balkans.
No wonder; but a bad idea nonetheless. Operation Balkan Storm may be worth talking about, if tough talk plus economic sanctions help persuade President Slobodan Milosevic to give up his fight for a Greater Serbia. But the idea that a UN or NATO army will otherwise barge into the Balkans to set matters right had better remain a bluff. On two counts--one moral, the other practical--the parallel with the Gulf is dangerously wrong.
In the Gulf, first of all, the attribution of blame was straightforward. One country grabbing another presents a simpler case, morally and legally, than one country breaking into a multitude of warring bits. Though it is unfashionable to say so, the Serbs had a case. Serbs who went to bed one evening as a majority in a state called Yugoslavia and woke up a day later as a minority in a state called Croatia, with no agreement on how their rights would be protected in the new state, had at least some grounds for complaint. True, Mr Milosevic's Serb nationalism helped decide Croatia to go it alone. And true, over recent months the moral picture has become clearer: Mr Milosevic's aim to carve a Greater Serbia out of ex-Yugoslavia has become steadily more blatant, his means steadily more ruthless. At the same time, however, the practical arguments against military intervention have multiplied.
LINES IN THE QUAGMIRE
The armies of Desert Storm had a politically intelligible mission: to evict an invader and restore the status quo. In the Balkans hardly anybody, least of all the victims of Serbian aggression, thinks it is possible to glue Yugoslavia back together again. Nor, even if it were possible, would they want to try. One of the paradoxes of this war is that although it is the Serbs who have had the better of the fighting, it is the breakaway republics that have achieved the bigger political victory. What is at stake now is not whether Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia & Hercegovina get self-determination: they have it, or soon will. The issue is whether Serbia succeeds in attaching to its territories those bits of the new states where Serbs can claim to be, or make themselves into, a majority.
Is it feasible to send an international army to resurrect the pre-war borders, now that more than 1m people have already been uprooted? The experience of the UN peacekeepers in Croatia is a guide to the size of the task. When Serbia and Croatia ran out of puff after six months of fighting, the UN inserted 14,000 men to monitor the ceasefire. Guarding a ceasefire when enemies have indeed ceased firing is the sort of peacekeeping job the UN is supposed to be good at. The force in Croatia is one of the biggest the UN has ever assembled. Yet it has still not stamped out the process of ""ethnic cleansing"" (pogroms and expulsions) by which the Serbs are tightening their grip on captured Croatian territory. Few if any refugees have returned to their homes, and there is no glimmer of agreement between Croatia and Serbia about borders.
In Croatia the peacekeepers went in with the consent of the parties at war, to monitor an established ceasefire. They are already overstretched. Sending UN or NATO soldiers into boiling Bosnia, to re-establish and then police borders straddled by warring tribes and militias, would be a huge gamble. It would certainly require scores of thousands of troops, ready to kill and be killed.
And what then? The map of Yugoslavia made little ethnic sense. Nor, tragically, do its constituent parts. The peacekeepers might impose calm, only to preside over an armed stalemate like the one that has prevailed for nearly 20 years in partitioned Cyprus, or 70 years in partitioned Ireland. At worst, military intervention could end in a bloodbath, enlarging the war it was designed to end. Better, for now, to rely on economic sanctions to restrain Serb ambitions."

Like Mr Perot, outside directors have moved on to higher things. GM's tied their boss's hands in April. In Britain outside directors, with big shareholders' backing, recently removed the chairmen of the Burton Group, a retailer, and of Barclays Bank. Desperate times require desperate remedies, it is argued; falling profits and dividends have made giant-killers of once passive Jacks. Yet some shareholders' increased determination to play a role in running the companies they own looks less cyclical than that suggests. A report on May 27th by a group of Britain's financial great and good proposes some ways to help them, but not enough (see page 76).
The report from Sir Adrian Cadbury and his committee was prompted by public concern over a string of unexpected collapses of recently audited firms and over big rises in executive pay. Its brief was therefore the financial aspects of corporate governance. But its roots lie deeper, in fears on both sides of the Atlantic that the absence of committed owners is sapping corporate performance. Since Anglo-American capitalism outgrew owner-management early this century, the interests of those who own a company and those who run it have seemed ever harder to align. That was clearest in the hostile takeovers of the 1980s, which pitted bosses keen to keep their jobs against shareholders intent on maximising profits. Escalating executive pay has heightened those antagonisms. Proxy battles in American annual general meetings this spring are a sign of shareholders' determination to be heard.
Another trend has helped to bring corporate governance to the fore. The increasing concentration of shares in the hands of investing institutions, and the shift among fund managers towards investing proportionately in the companies that make up share indices, is locking big shareholders into longer-term stakes. Especially in America, investors who once dumped shares in disgust if they were cross with a company's management are now more inclined to try to change its strategy.
In principle, shareholders have two main controls over managers: the company's board and the company's auditors. The board is supposed to look after their interests; non-executive directors, especially, are expected to do so. Auditors are supposed to tell shareholders whether a company's account of itself is broadly correct. Neither control is working properly. Boards are dominated by the company's bosses; non-executive directors, though approved by shareholders, are nominated by the chief executives they are meant to monitor. Auditors, too, are far closer to a company's managers, who supply the information they need, than to shareholders; other sorts of lucrative work, such as management consultancy and tax planning, may hang on the auditors' relationship with managers.
TO KNOW MORE IS TO CHANGE MORE
The Cadbury committee's attempts to improve both sorts of control are exceptionable only in their mildness. Companies should have enough good and truly independent non-executive directors for their views to carry weight. They should have committees dominated by outsiders to set executive directors' pay and to nominate new board members. An audit committee consisting entirely of outsiders should oversee the company's financial condition and maintain contact with auditors. There should be greater disclosure of top people's pay; directors should be appointed by shareholders every three years; and non-executive directors should be allowed to consult outside experts at company expense. Companies should disclose the non-audit work they commission from their auditors worldwide. And interim financial statements should be more comprehensive and reliable.
A few of these proposed changes might receive the backing of law. For the rest, companies listed on the London Stock Exchange would be required to say how far they were putting them into practice. Then, it is hoped, market pressure would shame reluctant firms into conformity.
Cadbury is broadly convincing on fuller disclosure and cleaner relations with auditors. But there are limits to accountancy. In the real world it is difficult for auditors to catch problems while there is still time to solve them; only rarely do they catch fraud. The root of poor corporate performance is usually failed strategy, or incompetent management, or both. Remedying these ills leads back to the boardroom.
Here the Cadbury report is less convincing--though not because its recommendations are wrong. Most represent best current practice in Britain and America, and have long been advocated by institutional investors. That is the trouble: more than half of Britain's big companies already have audit committees and many also have committees to set executive pay. One recent study suggests that firms with remuneration committees actually pay their bosses more than the others, and in ways no more likely to spur performance. Audit committees have been a condition of listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1978, and remuneration committees are almost universal. Yet excesses are, if anything, greater in America.
Neither Cadbury nor most other thinkers on the subject have tackled the crucial issue: how, and whether, to put share voting muscle behind board members. Institutions have fought shy of committing themselves to manning the boards of the hundreds of companies in which they own tiny fractions; nor is it likely, in any case, that fund managers are well equipped to run businesses. At the margin, though, ideas are springing up to harness institutions' financial muscle to seasoned managers' skills. In America financial entrepreneurs are persuading institutions to contribute to funds that will take a few big stakes and intervene actively in companies' management. There is talk in America and Britain of how institutions could pool their shares in companies and nominate an outside director or two on the strength of it.
These would be worthwhile experiments. But corporate governance is doomed to remain a messy compromise. Decades of modern capitalism have yielded no perfect model; nor will decades more."

It took the killing of Italy's most prominent politician, Aldo Moro, by the Red Brigades in 1978 to make Italians realise that they had to beat political terrorism or watch democracy decay. The killing of Italy's most prominent crime-fighter, Giovanni Falcone, by the Mafia last weekend faces them with a similar choice. Even before this murder, there were signs that many Italians had already come to see that a much more determined effort was needed to combat the Mafia and its mainland cousins, the Camorra and the 'Ndragheta. The composition of the next government--the first task of Italy's new president (see page 51)--will give some clues as to whether the country's politicians are at last coming round to the same view.
It may seem odd to suggest that a criminal organisation, even one as ruthless as the Mafia, poses a threat to democracy; and odder still that politicians should not be the first to meet it. Yet Mr Falcone's murder was not just a common-or-garden gangster's crime. It was a political act, designed to show that the Mafia, not the civil authorities, are in charge in Sicily. Worse, it was a political act different only in its egregiousness from many others tolerated by Italian politicians. Patronage and corruption have become so much a part of Italian political life that many politicians can no longer tell the difference between right and wrong. Even those with honest instincts, by operating a spoils system of politics, have been corrupted. In tolerating small crimes, politicians have grown powerless to stop big crimes. Thus has democracy been debauched.
THE COMPLAISANT SOCIETY
In all democracies the line between keeping in touch with the voters (a Good Thing) and buying their votes (a Bad Thing) is blurred. Grants aimed at interest groups, more money for the health service, a reprieve for an unneeded military base, even
pre-election tax cut are all considered a regrettable but not-too-shocking part of the political game. They are bribes, but bribes that are perhaps worth paying if they make some bigger achievement possible. Besides, the opposition will always expose them and, if they are unduly scandalous, the voters can always vote the government out.
So it is in Italy as elsewhere--except that in Italy there are differences. First, the state is ubiquitous. Not only does it provide (at least in theory) all the usual services, but it also owns an unusually large proportion of industry, and of television. The scope for political interference and patronage, if not outright corruption, is thus huge.
Second, a culture of cheating has been allowed to take root. Taxes are not paid (especially by professionals), regulations are not kept, pensions are paid to phoney invalids, the black economy thrives. At the same time contracts for public works, especially in the poor south, are given in the knowledge that part of the money will go to the Mafia or other criminals.
Third, the political system has come to be run for the benefit of the parties, not the voters. The party bigwigs, not the locals, choose the candidates for each constituency, who then owe their primary allegiance to the party bosses, not the electorate. The bosses then get together across party lines to share out the rewards. In local governments they may also take turns in accepting kickbacks from municipal suppliers, a system that has recently come to light in all its grubbiness in Milan.
Fourth, and most important, there is no opposition, at least not an opposition capable of forming an alternative government. After each election, the parties simply take it in turns to shuffle portfolios. Every one of Italy's 50 post-war governments has been dominated by the Christian Democrats.
For all these reasons, the degree of corruption in Italian politics is greater than that in most modern democracies. This corruption has bred such cosy relations between some politicians and the Mafia that many voters have started to protest. Opposition to corruption and misgovernment from Rome was the central plank of the Lombard League which, together with its northern allies, won 9% of the national vote (20% in Lombardy) in the general election in April. It was fuelled not just by the scandal in Milan but also by the March shooting--almost certainly by the Mafia--of Salvo Lima, a Sicilian Christian Democrat who had been able to deliver votes by the bucketful for Giulio Andreotti, Italy's prime minister.
The four parties of the governing coalition, and especially the Socialists and the Christian Democrats, were unambiguously rebuked by the voters in the election. Since then, however, their leaders have tried to carry on business as usual, pretending that nothing has happened. While Rome fiddled, Italy burnt: the public debt mounted, and the Mafia plotted.
Mr Andreotti did not go to the funeral this week of Mr Falcone and those who died with him: public outrage in Sicily was too great. Giovanni Spadolini, the acting president, did attend, and despite his unblemished record was duly abused by the mourners. The reason is that those who are in the front line against the Mafia no longer see much distinction between the criminals they hunt and the politicians, almost all politicians, in Rome. On too many occasions those in authority have been found wanting: they have moved police when they were becoming effective, they have undermined investigations, they have failed to give support. If not actually in cahoots with the Mafia, the politicians have allowed it to prosper.
It will take a huge national effort to defeat the Mafia and cleanse Italian political life. One, however, cannot be done without the other. If the killing of Mr Falcone hastens that realisation, it will not have been all bad."

That neglect is a mistake. For businessmen it could prove a disaster. Nobody today needs reminding of Japan's weight as market or competitor. With China and now India well placed for a sustained burst of economic speed, large swathes of Asia may in another 20 years be home to several more Japans. Businessmen who do not start thinking about this now will be repeating the error made in the 1960s by American car makers, who thought Japanese competitors too weak to be a threat, and Japanese consumers too poor to be an opportunity.
Arithmetic tells much of the story. The countries between Afghanistan in the west, Japan in the east, Korea in the north and New Zealand in the south contain 3 billion people, around 55% of all mankind. Around 1970, economic growth in the region's developing countries began to accelerate. Between 1973 and 1987, real GDP in Asia went up by 6-1/4% a year, nearly twice the rate in Latin America and more than double what the rich industrial countries could manage. Despite the recent worldwide slowdown, growth in developing Asia has hardly flickered. With saving high, investment strong, populations young and intra-Asian trade now bigger than trans-Pacific trade, there is every chance that many countries will do even better in future. China and India, with 2 billion people between them and economic reforms under way, have the potential to grow at rates approaching 10% a year--a feat China actually accomplished in the ten years after 1978.
Countries that seem implausible places to do business because of their low average incomes suddenly look large and inviting when those averages are put in perspective. Indonesia's income per head, for instance, is only $550. But the richest 10% of Indonesians spend about as much as the average consumer in Portugal--and there are 19m such Indonesians, as opposed to only 10m Portuguese. Many of Asia's markets are not merely already big, but growing fast. Asia now buys half the world's output of semiconductors (a share equally divided between Japan and the rest of the region), generates 16% of the world's property and casualty insurance premiums, buys 40% of the world's televisions. And Asia should interest businessmen not just as a market, but also as a place to learn. Its consumers are demanding, the competition is fierce, and the tastes of its young populations change quickly. Asia sharpens companies for doing business elsewhere.
NO FREE NOODLES
This week we begin an occasional series of articles on multinationals in Asia (see page 63). Some of these will be about home-grown Asian multinationals that the West will be seeing more of, but most will be about western companies coming to grips with the region. Their experiences offer a challenge for others wishing to follow; a challenge, and a warning.
The challenge is to deal with such a vast, and vastly diverse, area. Asia has three or four main cultures and several smaller ones, hundreds of languages, myriad blood-lines and every imaginable climate. It may indeed make sense to split the region in some ways: most western multinationals put Japan in a class of its own. For all this diversity, however, Asia is a unity. Otherwise, the difference between its economic performance and that of other regions over the past 20 years would not have been so striking. Nor would India now be looking to Seoul and Taipei for its economic model, instead of to Moscow and the Fabian Society, its beacons in the 1950s. Some companies are making surprising progress in marketing to all of Asia. A Hong Kong venture called STAR-TV is building up a huge audience (though as yet no profit to speak of) beaming television throughout Asia by satellite. In India alone, 20m people tune in to STAR at some time or other.
The size of the region poses particular difficulties for management. Any global company must decide how much autonomy to give its outposts, how to judge their performance, how to define lines of authority based both on products and on geography. These difficulties are magnified in Asia. Its distance from headquarters in America or Europe is huge, the time-difference exhausting: ask an Asian manager accustomed to being telephoned at 2 am in Hong Kong, because it is 6 pm in London and a decision needs to be made. The conflicts between the demands of marketing (which must be local) and those of production (often, the more global the better) are also greater in Asia, because lines of supply are longer and social and economic conditions are even more diverse. Companies try to meet the management challenge in a multitude of ways; but handling it correctly is crucial.
And the warning? Get in soon. Almost all western successes in Asia have been built on an early commitment to the place, usually well before profits are made, and a consistent accumulation thereafter of contacts, sales and--most important--local people to work for you and rise through your ranks. Asian business, especially the large part of it under Chinese cultural sway, is based far more than business in the West on personal contacts and trust. One day this will fade. One day it will be possible to arrive in Asia through an acquisition rather than a local pedigree; but, except in Japan, that will not happen in the next 20 years. If that seems too far to look ahead, remember what happened to those American car makers who, in the 1960s, saw no cause to fear Japan."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224171072/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/6?accountid=14657,"""A nation should never prevent another nation from trading with it, except for very great reasons,"" wrote Montesquieu in ""L'Esprit des Lois"". The American government would do well to remember his advice as it considers the proposed sale of the missile business of Texas-based LTV, a bankrupt conglomerate, to Thomson-CSF, the defence arm of Thomson, a state-owned French conglomerate. The LTV deal, which is billed as the biggest-ever foreign takeover of an American defence company, is being vetted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee has until July 20th to send its recommendations to George Bush. Common sense has already deserted the debate over what that advice should be.
As a result, if the administration blocks the takeover, it will probably be for the wrong reasons. Rather than making a hardheaded economic assessment of the LTV affair, America is indulging in an ill-tempered debate over the threat foreign ownership poses to national security and the country's industrial base. This is worrying, because the LTV case could deter other foreign firms from buying into America's defence industry. To further that end, some in Congress wish to get their retaliation in first: two American senators, Robert Byrd and Lloyd Bentsen, recently introduced a bill that would prohibit the sale of LTV's defence and aerospace operations to ""any foreign organisation, corporation or individual"".
Their xenophobia is misguided. Faced with cancelled contracts, shrinking order books and exploding R&D costs, American defence companies need all the help they can get to recover from a post-cold-war hangover. A change in American thinking on security matters makes a purely national defence industry look anachronistic, too. In a much-leaked internal document, the Pentagon says America should leave its hegemonic past behind and promote new structures for collective defence. What better way to start than by encouraging cross-border links between arms makers?
Xenophobia aside, Thomson's opponents still argue the LTV deal should be shot down. One reason, they say, is that France sells arms to dodgy regimes. True, the French have armed countries, such as Iraq and Libya, which have a habit of turning their weapons on Americans. But as Irangate and, more recently, Iraqgate have shown, America has erred in the same way (see page 24).(Page 24 Omitted) In any case, if the direction of French arms exports is the chief cause for concern, the American government can safely back Thomson-CSF's bid: LTV, which is planned to become the heart of Thomson's missile business, would remain subject to American export controls.
The real danger, says another anti-Thomson faction, lies elsewhere: the French will milk LTV of its secrets and then sell them to other countries. But the Pentagon could restrict French access to LTV's choicest technologies by, for example, insisting that the top management and board of LTV were American citizens with security clearances. Thomson's opponents also claim that the deal would weaken America's defence industry by shifting subcontracting work and R&D from Texas to France. Yet Thomson-CSF's record in buying civil-electronics firms in America--like that of most inward investors--shows that it has brought more technology and management know-how to its acquisitions than it has taken away.
NATIONALISNG THE WORLD
None of these arguments gives America's government a good reason to deny LTV's creditors the right to sell the firm's defence business to Thomson. There is, however, one such reason, which the debate has so far largely neglected: Thomson is a state-owned company. State-owned businesses, no matter what their nationality, are anti-competitive. Thomson-CSF, in which the French state has a 59% stake, says it is profitable and that it is paying for the LTV acquisition out of its own pocket. But other parts of the Thomson group are desperately in need of more state cash (see page 70). American competitors rightly worry that Thomson-CSF may in future seek help from the French state too. Even if they receive no other support, state firms have access to cheap finance and an implicit state guarantee of their debts. A French nationalisation of LTV would therefore encourage American firms to press for all manner of subsidies to ""level the playing-field"".
If the deal goes ahead, the French government will, in effect, be nationalising one more company. It hardly matters that this company is American rather than French, or that it makes missiles rather than meat pies. What matters is that the takeover will extend public ownership, which is, in itself, a bad thing. Mind you, there is a simple reply to this objection: privatise Thomson-CSF. France's government has always rejected this idea. It argues, as you might guess, that companies in strategic industries such as defence should not be allowed to fall into foreign hands. How the burdens of public ownership befuddle the brain."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224169315/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/7?accountid=14657,"Never was a gadget so misrepresented as the mobile telephone. Sneered at as rich men's toys, the machines are set to become one of the consumer products of the century. Already catching on faster than the first cars, and not far behind video-recorders, they may yet change the way society works as radically as either.
Along the way, mobile telephones have made fools of pundits and regulators, and fat cats of investors. Back in the early 1980s, when the first systems were built, industry watchers reckoned that the machine would find a niche only as a luxury item for hard pressed businessmen. ""It was perceived as an elite thing--you'd only have one of these things if you had a Rolls-Royce,"" says Keith Mallinson, at the London office of the Yankee Group, a consultancy. Governments agreed: to make what they thought risky ventures more attractive, they allowed only one or two companies to operate in each national market.
The guesses turned out to be wildly wrong. Right from the start, subscriber figures soared. Protected from competition by government guarantees against new licences being awarded, some operators made fat profits. Working a cosy duopoly, the two British mobile operators, BT'S Cellnet and Racal's Vodafone, have kept prices and margins high. Vodafone, the better-managed of the two, enjoys 50% operating margins and a 60% return on capital. In six years the firm has turned from a minor unit of a modest electronics firm into Europe's 65th biggest company by market capitalisation.
The industry has shrugged off recession. Though operators moan about rising subscriber ""churn""--meaning lost customers--deserters have been more than made up for by new recruits. In 1991 the American industry saw a net gain of 2.3m new subscribers, a 43% increase. In Europe the increase was 35%. Those are growth rates that true luxury industries would die for, and a sign that mobile telephony no longer is one.
As the new telephony's success becomes apparent, governments are starting to let more operators into the market. Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Holland, South Korea Hong Kong, Australia and Brazil will all see licence auctions this year. In half-a-dozen countries--Britain, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Portugal--licence-winners of previous years are now switching on the networks that they have built.
At the same time, new investors are entering the market. Shelby Bryan, founder of Millicom, an American firm that owns a string of franchises from Moscow to Mauritius, notes ruefully that, whereas a few years ago he faced only a dozen or so rival bidders for each new licence, now there are twice that number. Recently, the Indian government received no fewer than 30 bids in response to its offer of one licence a piece in Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras. Most came from local entrepreneurs. In Eastern Europe, mobile-telephone licences are the most sought-after investment opportunities of the region. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development reports that, though it would like to take equity stakes in new telecoms ventures, its western fellow-investors are so keen to hang on to all the equity for themselves that loans are the only money they will accept.
COMPETITION MAKES THINGS HAPPEN
The best-developed markets for the new telephony are those where two or more operators opened up the market in competition. In countries like America, Britain and Sweden, which all introduced competition in the early-to-middle 1980s, more than 2% of the population have mobile telephones. In equally rich Germany, Italy and Spain, whose second operators have yet to launch, the figures are not half as high.
In Sweden, which has had two rival operators since 1981, 7% of the population already owns a mobile telephone. More than half of all new connections are of mobile telephones, not fixed lines. This year the gap will widen, when a third mobile operator, owned by a consortium led by SAS, Volvo and Vodafone, enters the market.
To defend themselves, Sweden's existing mobile operators are aiming down-market. By offering combinations of cheap access fees and extra-high charges for calls made during working hours, they hope to attract new private users without seeing their present high-paying business users switch to the new tariffs. Tactics like these are already commonplace in America: ask a mobile telephone company for its tariffs, and it hands over a tome 50 pages long.
The British industry is about to undergo a similar change. Two new operators launching next year will reportedly set their prices around 25% below Cellnet's and Vodafone's. Mercury PCN, owned by Cable and Wireless, says it will aim for residential users. Unlike the first systems, which spread out like a spider's web via city centres and motorways, Mercury PCN will expand like an oil slick through London's suburbs. Existing operators are hitting back with clever marketing. The Automobile Association, which runs a breakdown service for motorists, recently started hiring out car-telephones for L9.99 ($18) a month--L15 less than the standard rental. Equipped with just two buttons, the telephones can only call the AA's control centre and the police.
Falls in call prices are dwarfed by falls in equipment prices. As with personal computers--many of whose components they share--cheaper, cleverer electronics are making handsets better value by the month. Already they can be no bigger than a cigarette packet. The remaining constraints on miniaturisation are bulky batteries and the distance between human ear and mouth. ""Telephone jewellery""--small earpieces that pick up their wearers' speech from the vibrations of the jawbone--may get round even that fact of life. British Telecom is already studying such devices.
NO ESCAPE
With hindsight, the mobile telephone's success looks easy to predict. Though most business cards carry three different telephone numbers or more, much of the time the owner is not available at any of them. As a result, fewer than a quarter of business calls reach the person they are meant for at the first attempt. Mobile telephones do away with that problem at a stroke.
Problem, or blessed relief? ""People will be continuously tethered to society--at least to those segments of society with which they tend to interact,"" says Eli Noam, a professor of communications at Columbia University. Some people might find that prospect horrifying. Not most, though. In practice, garrulousness and curiosity tend to win the day, as the history of wire-line telephones shows. In 1898 one A.H. Hastie, head of the British Association for the Protection of Telephone Subscribers, fumed that answering the telephone's imperious ring was as bad as having to ""open one's door to see unwelcome visitors"". He was right, as any victim of telephone selling knows. But the world was too busy anwering its telephone to listen. In 1912 a German psychiatrist told Telephony magazine that the telephone rendered some of his excitable patients hysterical. In 1927 some American sociologists were still fretting that telephone calls, then flooding in at an average of one every 112 days, meant that ""personal isolation--inaccessibility to the demands of others for access to one's attention--is increasingly rare"". Usage soared all the while.
In fact, the choice is not either/or. On wireline networks, the commonest way to filter out unwanted callers is a secretary. With mobile telephones, the network can do the job. Already most systems can divert calls to different numbers, including central voice-mailboxes. Installing such abilities is doubly in the network operator's interest. If a caller tries to ring a mobile telephone that is not connected, he pays no fee. But if he connects to a voice-mailbox, he not only pays for that call but probably stimulates a later return call as well.
Malcolm Ross, an Arthur D. Little consultant, reckons that for mobile telephones to become universal, they must be able to filter calls not just by caller, but by time and place as well. Telephones could be programmed to take calls, for example, from colleagues until 6.30 pm, and after that only from family and friends. Better still, by looking to see where the user is, the network could decide for itself which calls to pass where. Charges on some incoming calls--from a daughter away at college, for example--might go on the user's bill rather than the caller's. Touch screens showing icon-driven menus, like the ones personal computers use, could make it easy to programme telephones to do such things.
All these refinements are already in the laboratories. ""Soon the networks will offer anything their marketing managers ask for,"" says Michael Vadon, head of a London consultancy. ""The question is what people feel comfortable with, what enables them to feel they're in control."" The issue, that is, is no longer which of an alphabet soup of different standards and systems--TACS, GSM, PCN, etc--wins the market, but what kind of services consumers will demand. Marketing men are taking over from engineers as the drivers of the industry.
GOODBYE TO THE MESSENGER
When many more people have mobile telephones in their pockets, how will that change the way they live? For some clues, look at what wire-line telephones have done to society so far.
The telephone made some companies bigger. By doing away with information transport time, it transferred power from regional bosses to headquarters, and let firms grow without suffocating under the weight of their own message-taking. Coincidentally, telephony also helped to spawn the archetypal corporate palace, the skyscraper. In the days of messenger boys, such buildings would have had to use all their floorspace for lift shafts. At the same time, telephony also let firms fragment: head office no longer had to sit on top of the factory.
Mobile telephones are already having similar effects. Noticeably, they help the small businessman. Of Cellnet's customers, over 50% are self-employed, and another 25% work for companies with fewer than 100 employees. Plumbers, builders and the like use mobile telephones to take and make customer calls while out on jobs, a task previously left to their spouses, who are now free to go out to work themselves.
Conversely, in some firms mobile communications have helped centralise control. Bankers at Morgan Stanley's New York office wear pagers always and everywhere, even after hours, so that they can be rung in times of crisis. So do journalists on some daily newspapers. The distinctions between free time and working time, between office and out-of-office, are being blurred. The boss can summon an employee at any time and any place. But equally the employee can claim to be available even while he is out drinking in office hours.
Family behaviour too has been altered. The biggest users of pagers in Hong Kong are what Mr Noam calls ""tele-parents"". After equipping their children with pagers, parents feel happy to let them shop and meet friends alone. For children, junking their pagers has become as important a gesture of independence as buying a moped.
FIXED-LINK FIGHT-BACK
Will mobile telephones replace fixed-link ones? In places starting almost from scratch they are already doing so. In the poor countries of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, existing networks are so small and bad that those who can afford it buy mobile telephones just to make calls at all. That is no accident. Wireline systems are best at providing lots of capacity over a small area, making them a natural fit, albeit a limited one, for the rich, crowded, first world. Radio-based systems excel at providing a little capacity over a wide area, making them an obvious choice for the third world. Mobile networks are cheap and quick to build. Millicom's Mr Bryan reckons he can give a small country initial coverage within two years for $5m or so, and then add extra radio transmitters as the market requires. In poor countries, radio networks are also easier to safeguard against theft (no attractive copper wires) and to repair (no need to send linemen out into the bush.
In countries with good wire-line systems already in place, the economics tilt the other way. While mobile operators are still spending heavily on expanding their coverage, wire-line companies, their initial network investment long written off, can always beat them on price. Many governments increase the imbalance by requiring mobile operators to lease the long-distance lines used to send calls between distant radio masts from the wire-line company, instead of building their own. By charging mobile firms exorbitantly for those lines, a monopoly wire-line operator can put an effective floor under the prices of its mobile competitors.
More constructively, wire-line networks are beginning to mimic some of the features that make mobile telephones attractive. AT&T has just introduced what it calls a ""virtual mobility"" service. For $7 a month, customers can hire personal numbers which follow them throughout the United States. Away from home or office, the user punches in codes to tell the network where he is. From then on, calls to his number are routed to that telephone. Like mobile telephones, this does away with the caller's need to know the location of the person to be reached. The service also allows the customer to decide which calls he wants routed where. As deregulation spreads from the mobile industry--which is where most governments first experimented with it--to the fixed-link one, the wireline operators will no doubt become nimbler at inventing such services.
Even if voice traffic does gradually migrate to radio, that does not mean that wireline networks are condemned to die. On the contrary, they will probably enter a glamorous renaissance. High-capacity--possibly fibre-optic--wires will allow the sort of in-home, multi-media services that still mostly exist only in the imagination--on-line picture and data libraries, dial-up films, interactive game shows and documentaries.
MULTIPLYING MACHINERY
The telephone prophet's favourite pipedream is the ""universal communications system""--the tiny do-it-all unit that connects to any network, at any time and in any way that the user wants it to. That is not likely. Telecommunications deregulation is pushing things emphatically the other way. The tidy one-company, one-country networks that have provided telephony for the past 100 years are quickly being overlaid by a messy but fertile tangle of rival, overlapping systems, each equipped with terminals of its own.
For a glimpse of the telephone's future, look at the cab of the next taxi you take. It is likely to be crammed with communications devices--a two-way data system for taking and sending routine messages to the fleet controller, a voice back-up system for special queries, a mobile telephone for taking calls from private customers, another for passengers to use; plus a credit-card swiper, linked by radio to a verification centre, for taking the fare.
The ordinary citizen could soon be hung around with just as many gadgets. He may already own an ordinary wire-line telephone, a cordless handset and a small mobile telephone. Soon he will instal a permanent cheap-rate car-phone for breakdowns. He will hire a bulkier and more expensive portable for use while abroad, and, when he needs it, a satellite telephone with which to keep in touch while he treks through the Amazon rainforest. All those things are available now, or will be within five years. What comes after them is up to the customer's imagination."

Would that the claim still held. When Congress began legislating for ""mandatory"" spending programmes (otherwise known as entitlements), it also began legislating away its own power to control government spending. It is this which lies at the heart of the federal deficit and of current congressional ills.
For the first 170 years of its existence, the business of Congress was largely to balance its competing commitments (such as providing for defence, a national infrastructure and regulation of commerce) with a finite set of financial resources. That, in essence, is what budgeting used to be about. The rise of social programmes and mandatory spending since the 1960s changed things. As Aaron Wildavsky, an academic, puts it, ""entitlement is, well, entitlement"": a legal obligation by government to pay certain benefits to the eligible, whether it be for health care, for retirement or to compensate for a loss of employment. With that obligation, Congress has surrendered its constraining influence, since entitlements must be paid before all else. Budgeting, in the sense of balancing competing claims, has become redundant for all but a tiny proportion of congressional business. Now government is mainly in the business of writing its citizens cheques.
Entitlement cheques today make up half of America's federal budget, or over $700 billion (up from a tenth of the budget 30 years ago). Even that figure excludes two huge ""mandatory"" programmes. These are the taxpayer's commitment to bail out the depositors of bust banks and thrifts, and his commitment to pay interest on $2.7 trillion of national debt. America's federal debt is itself a main fact and symbol of the country's runaway entitlements. Net interest costs alone, at an annual $200 billion, are the third-largest category of federal spending, behind defence and social security (which mainly includes pensions).
A further quasi-entitlement should be added to the $700 billion, however. Tax breaks towards health care, housing, employment and retirement are revenues forgone by government that have to be made up elsewhere. These breaks are reckoned by the new ""Green Book"" put out by the House Ways and Means Committee to be worth $257 billion for the next fiscal year. Thus, in total, American citizens enjoy a ""right"" to receive almost $1 trillion a year by government transfer.
Entitlements are growing faster than any other part of the federal government, and threaten to grow still faster. Between 1970 and 1990 real spending on entitlements grew by more than 6% a year, while the economy grew by an annual average of 2.7%. Entitlement spending has grown at the expense of other, so-called discretionary spending. This is the area over which Congress at least has budgeting power. Here spending has been fiercely squeezed, growing by around 2% a year in the 20 years to 1990.
Next year social security, at $300 billlon, will overtake defence (a discretionary cost that three decades ago accounted for half the total budget) to become the government's single biggest programme. At least social security is growing by a mere 6%, in real terms. Medicare (health care for the old, costing an annual $130 billion) and Medicaid (health care for the poor, costing $70 billion) are growing at double-digit rates.
A sum of nearly $1 trillion a year might seem justified if widely desired goals were achieved. The most obvious goal, and the one about which few disagree, at least in principle, is the alleviation of unacceptable poverty. Have entitlements worked here?
In 1988 Robert Haveman, an academic at the University of Wisconsin, looked at official poverty rates between 1949 and 1983. Over that period the number of Americans officially described as poor fell from 44% to 24% if the government benefits they received were not counted. When government benefits were included, the number of poor fell from 41% to 15%. Benefits therefore succeeded in easing poverty. The trouble is, poverty is rising again at a time when government is getting meaner to the poor. According to the Green Book, the number of officially poor people grew by nearly 9m between 1979 and 1990. It calculates that cuts in social and welfare programmes accounted for nearly half that growth.
Poverty could be alleviated more cheaply through public transfers if benefits were more selective. But selective programmes risk losing broad public support. As it is, programmes aimed solely at the poor are the system's most rigorous. Almost all--Medicaid, food stamps and family support--are means-tested. Yet means-tested programmes account for just $140 billion a year, one-fifth of all entitlement spending. That is roughly equivalent to the cost of Medicare alone, which is only marginally means-tested.
The biggest programmes are big precisely because much of their benefit goes to the well-off, even if proportionately less of the cost is paid by them. Entitlements have clearly benefited the old. Three-quarters of those in retirement have consumption levels at least as great as during their working years. Up to one-third will have levels that are 130% higher, according to Mr Haveman.
At what cost to the young have these benefits to the old been won? Children under 18 are 50% more likely to live in poverty than the rest of the nation. They are only a tenth as likely as an old person to receive the fruits of government money. Spending on the old rose, in current dollars, from $3,860 per person in 1965 to $11,350 per person in 1990. The outlay per child in 1990 was $1,020. Judged as investments, these priorities look odd."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224175230/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/9?accountid=14657,"For much of this year a quirky, cantankerous, congressman from south Texas, Henry Gonzalez, has stood on an empty House floor reading classified documents into the congressional record. These documents, plus the sleuthing of Mr Gonzalez's House Banking Committee and of some journalists, are creating a picture of the Republican administration's uncomfortably cosy links with Iraq before the Gulf war.
America began sidling up to Iraq almost a decade before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990. As early as 1982 the Reagan administration struck Iraq from its list of terrorist supporting countries. Although America was ostensibly neutral during the Iran-Iraq war, Lawrence Eagleburger, then an under-secretary of state, urged America's state-owned Exim Bank to open a line of credit to Iraq in 1983.
The following year George Bush, then vice-president, called up a college chum who happened to be chairman of the Exim Bank, to plug the idea of a loan guarantee to Iraq. In 1987 Mr Bush called the bank again to promote Mr Hussein. ""Now is the time"", Mr Bush's telephone script runs, ""to begin building a solid relationship with Iraq for the future.""
The most visible blossom on that relationship was the $3.4 billion of loan guarantees granted by the Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) between 1987 and 1990. These were meant to finance Iraqi purchases of American produce. Of the total money guaranteed, $900m had been lent by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banco Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). That bank was raided by federal agents in August 1989. Surprisingly, in addition to the state-guaranteed loans, it transpired that the BNL branch had extended Iraq $2.2 billion in loans, allegedly unauthorised by head office and without the Fed's knowledge. The branch's then-manager, Christopher Drogoul, faces trial this June.
After the raid it became clear that BNL money to Iraq was turning up in the oddest places. An agriculture department memo even suggested that American-guaranteed money for Iraq had been diverted to buy military equipment.
The whole episode was a great inconvenience for the Bush administration, which was pushing for a big aid programme for Mr Hussein during 1990. In October 1989 Mr Bush issued a national security directive, ordering that relations be built up with Iraq as a matter of American policy in the Gulf. That document, still classified, is now much sought-after by Iraqgate sleuths.
Soon afterwards, James Baker, the secretary of state, met Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign secretary, and sought assurances that the Iraqi government was not involved in the BNL affair. Assurances supplied, he urged the agriculture department to resume full-scale guarantees to Iraq. These had been cut sharply after the raid on BNL. The price of cosiness is now nearly $2 billion in CCC loan defaults.
Scandal-mongers see deception, obfuscation and dishonesty at the administration's every turn. On June 2nd the House Judiciary Committee is likely to decide whether to appoint that standby of any proper Washington scandal--an independent counsel."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224169389/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/10?accountid=14657,"On May 21st Ross Perot arrived at Kentucky's domed capitol, in Frankfort. Inside the Capitol's rotunda, a statue of one famous Kentuckian--Jefferson Davis, the president of the confederacy--stares icily at the back of Abraham Lincoln. Around the corner is a bust of Colonel Harland Sanders, of fried-chicken fame (""He changed the eating habits of the world and made Kentucky a household word"").
About 600 supporters of Mr Perot, convinced that their hero would soon be famous enough to have a pedestal of his own, gathered outside the capitol as the Texan businessman delivered the petitions that were needed to put his name on the presidential ballot in November. By Kentucky law, he needed 5,000 such petitions; within a month, Mr Perot's supporters had gathered 40,000 of them. By May 26th he was on the ballot in seven states, and, at a rally planned for May 29th in Orlando, Florida, Mr Perot intended to wrap up the petition drive in another six states. There is little reason to doubt that he will end up on the ballot in all 50 states.
The crowd in Frankfort heard Mr Perot's familiar pledges: that he would run only if ""the people"" wanted him to; that, as president, he would not be isolated in Washington; that (with Lech Walesa) he believed that ""words are plentiful but deeds are precious"". He told the crowd to forget the polls that show him leading both George Bush and Bill Clinton and to prepare for hard work. ""If you lose interest,"" said Mr Perot, ""it's over. I'm not going to pep you up.""
On the evidence of the spring, he will not have to. The Perotists have a genuine grass-roots impatience with politics as usual and seem well able to organise on their champion's behalf. At Frankfort his supporters were overwhelmingly white, older than the crowd you usually see at political rallies and well dressed. Of a random sample of 12 interviewed, ten identified themselves as Republicans; a suggestive snapshot, that confirms what academics have been saying for a month. Mr Perot's ""core"" support--the people who stick the envelopes and stand outside supermarkets with their petitions--are Republicans who are fed up with Mr Bush. They are the kind of people who say, without prompting, that the budget deficit is stealing the future from the mouths of their children and grandchildren.
Idiots they are not. In Washington much has been made of the fact that Mr Perot has, as yet, offered few detailed policies, and that when he tried to explain his plans for cutting the deficit on NBC television, his figures were quickly exploded. In Frankfort it was striking that most people interviewed knew the few things that Mr Perot is already committed to (he is, for example, in favour of a right to have an abortion and of gun control), but were not terribly bothered one way or the other. They were, as one man said, less interested in his policies than his principles. They found him honest and competent, and left it at that.
Although Mr Perot's core supporters may be natural Republicans, his themes have a broad appeal. For those who followed the early days of the Democratic race for the presidential nomination, there is something familiar about the Perot fans. Give them a Yankee twang and they would be virtually indistinguishable from the crowd who, in the winter, propelled Paul Tsongas, a retired senator from Massachusetts, to victory in the New Hampshire and Maryland primaries. Like Mr Perot, Mr Tsongas stressed the non-ideological aspects of his candidacy. Like Mr Perot, Mr Tsongas emphasised the importance of the economy and the primacy of the values of ""business"" (Mr Tsongas's line that you can't be ""pro-jobs and anti-business"" is pure Perot). Like Mr Perot, Mr Tsongas staked out liberal positions on non-economic matters like abortion.
But five weeks after winning in New Hampshire, Mr Tsongas was a spent force. Might Mr Perot, too, collapse? Is he nothing more than proof that nature (or, more accurately, the press) abhors a vacuum--a political vacuum created in equal parts by Mr Clinton's month-long retreat to lick his wounds from the primaries and Mr Bush's near-disappearance as a campaigning force? There are plenty who think so. One well-known academic thinks that, in November, Mr Perot will win less than the 6% that John Anderson achieved as an independent candidate in 1980. Alan Simpson, a Republican senator from Wyoming who is close to Mr Bush, has told the press: ""Give this guy what you've given Bush for 12 years and what you've given Clinton for 12 months and he'll begin to shrivel like squashed vines in the wintertime.""
Those who think that such an analysis gravely underestimates Mr Perot rest their case on three points. First, Mr Tsongas did not self-destruct; he was beaten, in an intensely competitive process, by a more resourceful campaigner. Mr Perot, on the other hand, has the unbounded luxury of running against nobody for the nomination of his ""party""; he has no internal opponents. Sooner or later, naturally, both the Bush and Clinton campaigns will try to ""define"" Mr Perot in the minds of the voters. But this will not be easy, since Mr Perot has skilfully claimed the high moral ground; he told a press conference in Frankfort that he would never stoop to personal criticism of his opponents. Neither the Bush nor the Clinton campaign wants to be accused by the anti-politics-as-usual candidate of running ""negative"" advertisements earlier than strictly necessary.
Second, Mr Perot is richer than the dreams of avarice. This gives him options simply not available to a Tsongas. He might decide, for example, that he has no need either for the staged rally or for 30-second television commercials. Instead, he is quite likely to buy 30-minute chunks of prime-time television, controlled entirely by himself, in which he tells the voters exactly who he is, on his own terms.
Third--remembering the crowd in Frankfort who yelped for blood every time a photographer blocked their view--Mr Perot has cleverly lumped the press in with the political establishment, and is running against the journalists as well as the political insiders. Mr Simpson is not alone in thinking that the steady drip of revelations about Mr Perot's peculiar past will somehow corrupt the pure waters of his campaign. Stories there are aplenty, from his obsession with the fate of American servicemen in South-East Asia to the circumstances in which, shocked by ungodliness on board ship, he sought an early discharge from the navy in the 1950s. But so far they have not had the slightest impact on his support. Part of the reason is that Mr Perot has succeeded where Mr Clinton failed, in portraying the press as interested only in irrelevant personal details rather than in questions of substance. In a way that Mr Clinton, who wants everybody to be his friend, never could be, Mr Perot is aggressive with the members of the press, deflecting their arrows back on to themselves. So far, it has done him nothing but good.
And so the choice is there. Is Mr Perot a springtime wonder, like a baseball rookie called to the big leagues who hits spectacularly before June but is back in the minor leagues by September? Or is he (and are the times) so different that he has rewritten the rules of politics? Is there a real chance that, for the first time since 1824, there will not be an absolute majority for one candidate in the electoral college, with the result that the election is determined, in accordance with the tortured terms of the 12th and 20th amendments to the constitution, in the House of Representatives? In Frankfort the crowd thought that even such an unlikely prospect was tame. They think that Mr Perot can win it all, at the first time of asking, in November, and as spring turns to summer an extraordinary number of other Americans are beginning to think so too."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224165657/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/11?accountid=14657,"George Bush has told the American coast guard to turn back all Haitian boats taking people to Florida, without allowing the passeners any opportunity to plead for asylum. This is the fifth American tactic to stem the flow of refugees since 1981, and it comes oddly from the government which protested so loudly when Hong Kong sent boat people back to Vietnam. But still the desperate Haitians keep coming.
The first tactic was adopted when Jean-Claude Duvalier was still in power in Haiti. The coast guard agreed with Mr Duvalier to intercept would-be refugees in international waters and return them to Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital. The second tactic was to take the Haitians to a detention centre in Florida for processing. The third was tried after a new surge of refugees was provoked by the coup that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide last September. The new plan was to take refugees first to a tent camp at the American naval base at Guantanamo in Cuba for processing. But that proved counter-productive: news that some refugees had been moved on from Guantanamo to Miami for processing encouraged another wave of refugees.
Almost 35,000 Haitians have set sail since the coup, and 170 have drowned. At one point, officials in Guantanamo were interviewing 450 people a day, seeking to sort out people wanting a better life from those ""with a well-founded fear of persecution"".
Last week Guantanamo reached its maximum capacity of 12,500. So a fourth tactic was adopted. The administration announced that in future coast-guard cutters would pick up only boats in distress, leaving sea-worthy vessels to continue the treacherous 600-mile journey to the Florida coast. Haitians were urged to stay at home and not risk drowning. ""In essence they are throwing the Haitians to the sharks,"" said Cheryl Little, a Miami immigration lawyer.
Three days later, on May 24th, Mr Bush rethought and tried the fifth tactic. He ordered the coast guard to pick up all refugees and send them home, whatever their reasons for leaving. Lawyers supporting the would-be refugees accused the administration of violating the Geneva Convention on Refugees, which prohibits the return of refugees if they face political persecution at home. The administration replied that it applied only to refugees on American territory. The lawyers called that a Catch-22 answer, since the coast guard is deliberately preventing the refugees from reaching American territory.
This human misery has drawn attention away from political attempts to restore Mr Aristide to the presidency through a trade embargo on Haiti sponsored by the Organisation of American States (OAS). The coupsters' government is surviving it. A recent meeting of OAS foreign ministers failed to offer any new ideas to resolve the Haitian saga other than tightening the embargo, which in turn will increase the flow of refugees. The OAS wants Haiti's rulers to accept the return of Mr Aristide as president with an independent-minded and reformed communist, Rene Theodore, as his prime minister, plus a strong OAS presence to make sure that human rights are protected. Those in control in Port-au-Prince, however, will not have Mr Aristide back at any price. For Haitians, that price is rising daily."

The race, which attracted an audience of 400,000 on May 24th, is also a celebration of the industrial mid-west, the lesser known cousin of the stereotypical agricultural mid-west.
The city of Indianapolis was once the headquarters of 64 motor manufacturers, and the track was originally built in 1909 to test-drive their cars. Engines from Detroit, steel from Pittsburgh, tyres from Akron, cars from Indianapolis and technology from local engineering colleges built the 500. The first race around the 2-1/2 mile oval took place in 1911. Although there have always been foreign drivers and builders--indeed, all but one of this year's entries were built in Britain--Indy is a race for people with names like Vukovich, Rathmann and Bettenhausen, the sons of immigrants who built the industrial base and tinkered with racing cars in their garages. Although much of its industry has rusted away, Indianapolis, the place and the race, remains as the embodiment of a culture.
Its traditions are handed down from generation to generation. Al Unser, Jr, this year's winner, is the son and nephew of previous winners. There were four members of the Andretti clan in the 1992 field; patriarch Mario, his sons Michael and Jeff, and his nephew John. And in the race for the 20th time was Gary Bettenhausen, who, as he raced down the main straightway, passed the spot where his father was killed in 1961.
Death has always been a part of motor racing and the Indianapolis 500. Over the years 65 people, including 40 drivers, have died in the race. Changes in the cars and the track have made racing much safer; but this year, for the first time in a decade, a driver, Jovy Marcelo of the Philippines, was killed during a relatively slow practice lap. The best often fail at Indianapolis, but come back. Roberto Guerrero nearly died in a crash at Indy, spent weeks in a coma, but this year set a record pole time of just over 232 mph.
The Indianapolis 500 is a ritual as well as a race. As the teams prepared this year, the track was taken over by marching bands, celebrities and past winners in antique cars. Jim Nabors sang, as always, ""Back Home Again in Indians"". The band played ""Taps"" to mark Memorial Day as four Navy jets flew over the track. Mary Hulman, widow of the track owner, rose from her wheelchair and created a new tradition, saying ""Lady and gentlemen, start your engines"", in recognition of Lyn St James, only the second woman to race at Indy. A cheer went up only to be drowned out within a second by the sound of the first engine powered to life, then followed by 32 other cars. As the field pulled away and started the parade lap, Roberto Guerrero's car suddenly lost its grip on the cold track and crashed into the infield wall. It was an omen for the day.
The race was marred by numerous accidents. It is a cruel myth that racing fans love crashes: the truth is that the crowd lamented every accident with audible moans. After his crash on lap ten, the car of Tom Sneva, a former winner, was hauled into the garage area--a $1m piece of junk, the carbon-fibre shell of the car collected like the hide of a dead animal.
Some in the vast crowd were oblivious to the race, treating it mainly as an opportunity to drink. But most were serious fans. Many millions have seen the race on television, but film cannot convey either the vastness of the track that stretches into a blur on the horizon or the speed of the cars, which seem impossibly fast as they rip through the air with a roaring vacuum sound.
Michael Andretti led for most of the race, enduring the sight of his father and brother crashing and being carried off the track. On lap 190, 25 miles before victory, his car gave out. Suddenly, the race was between ""Little Al"" Unser and Scott Goodyear, a Canadian, who had started last, with Goodyear gaining as the crowd screamed. On the final lap on the main straightway Goodyear at last pulled alongside Unser. He finished one quarter of a car length and less than a twentieth of a second behind Unser at the finish line. The green flag had dropped on the closest race in Indy history."

More than $1 billion hangs on the answer to that question, and each side has its champion. In one corner is George Will, a bow-tied conservative columnist. In the other stands Sharon Percy Rockefeller, a former chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Both Mrs Rockefeller and Mr Will insist that they speak on behalf of the common man.
Mr Will started the ball rolling with a newspaper column attacking the idea that the taxpayer should finance the CPB, which is asking Congress for 50% more money for 1993-96. If granted, its request would bring to $1.1 billion the amount it receives from the government. Mr Will argues that public television is ""an upper-middle-class entitlement"", a levy on the many for a few; although it may have needed government support 25 years ago, when it was the lone competitor against the networks in ""serious"" programmes, the advent of several serious cable-television channels has changed all that. Public broadcasters, Mr Will argues, should now be subject to the same market forces as everybody else.
A week later Mrs Rockefeller, who is now president of WETA, a public broadcasting station in Washington, DC, fired back. Public television, she protested, does not appeal only to yuppies. It draws viewers from a cross-section of the population. Moreover, in the 1980s a pilot study, designed to decide whether or not public television could survive in the open market, discovered that it could not.
According to Mrs Rockefeller, this makes government financing--17% of the CPB's budget--essential. In trying to clinch the argument, she noted that public television's 1990 broadcast of Wagner's ""Ring"" was watched by more people ""than had ever seen it live in all the 'Ring' productions since 1876.""
Public television is also under attack, as often before, for its alleged left-wing bias. Earlier this year an unknown number of anonymous senators exercised their privilege to place a ""hold"" on a bill to authorise CPB for another three years, so that they could look more closely at exactly what public broadcasting does and why.
What caught the attention of those senators, and others, were such offerings as ""Tongues Untied"", a documentary about black homosexuals; ""Citizen Dhoruba"", a flattering documentary about a member of the Black Panthers convicted of shooting two New York policemen; and two documentaries by Bill Moyers on the Iran-contra affair, ""The Secret Government"" and ""High Crimes and Misdemeanours"". ""Masterpiece Theatre"", which specialises in English costume dramas solemnly introduced by Alistair Cooke from a book-lined study, was fine by the politicians. But they did not want government money spent on programmes that upset them or their constituents.
Money, rather than outrage, is the real point. The budget deficit obliges politicians to make increasingly difficult choices or to boost public borrowing still further. As Mr Will puts it, ""Does public television have [a stronger] claim on some of the government's scarce resources...than child immunisation, the National Institutes of Health and a thousand competing causes?"" If it does, the burden of argument will now pass to Nancy Reagan's former press secretary, Sheila Tate, who was elected chairman of the CPB on May 19th."

At first, the question seems mad. With each new day comes word of an appearance by the president at a fund-raiser for his bid for re-election. Yet a series of recent conversations with members of both the administration and the Bush campaign reveals a picture of a listless, indecisive man, unable to take the steps that might rescue his tottering reputation. It is not just that the White House lacks leadership and the campaign a strategy--that much has been evident for a while--but that the president's camp fears that its boss lacks the drive to turn things around. Speculation comes easy and cheap: but is something going on?
Ever since the president returned from his ill-starred trip to Asia in January, he has done little that was not either inept or strictly by-the-book. A president ought to speak with prudence and knowledgeable assurance. Mr Bush has managed that only once in five months, on the March morning after the Super Tuesday primaries, when Pat Buchanan, his challenger for the Republican nomination, failed to dent the president's position in the south. For most of the rest of the year, he has looked as happy as Britain's Prince Charles and about as plugged in.
The Memorial Day weekend, for Bush-watchers, brought a new low, and not only because, as the Los Angeles Times put it, the ""usually ebullient vacationer"" when asked how he was doing, said ""about a seven"". There were more subtle signals about.
While Mr Bush spent the holiday in America doing not much more than presiding over an embarrassing flip-flop over Haitian refugees, his old friend and secretary of state, James Baker, was indulging in a whirlwind of activity on the other side of the Atlantic. One minute he was signing nuclear-weapons accords with the successors of the Soviet Union, the next getting tough with the Serbs. For Mr Baker this display of purposeful energy was nothing new, but it was sufficiently removed from the indecisiveness of the president to make the inevitable comparisons embarrassing: and that is new.
This election year has already taken several twists that have caught the president and his advisers badly off guard. Their strategy for re-election, fairly enough, was to appear presidential--to seem above the fray of domestic politics, and to remind a grateful public of the sure-footedness of the commander-in-chief of Desert Storm. They were tripped up three times; by Pat Buchanan, Ross Perot and the citizens of south-central Los Angeles.
Mr Bush's advisers had not anticipated a serious challenger for the Republican nomination. They thought they might have to deal with David Duke, a fringe racist. Instead they got Mr Buchanan--and panicked. No sooner was Mr Buchanan up and running in New Hampshire than Mr Bush was up there too, inarticulate, frenetic, and mouthing the kind of sympathy (""Message: I care"") that he does not deliver well. It was an exercise that demeaned the presidency: almost as bad, it was pointless, since Mr Buchanan never did, nor was ever likely to do, better than the 37% he won in eccentric, recession-mired New Hampshire. He was a minor irritant; a confident, assured president would have treated him as such.
But having helped to create the expectation that the presidency was, after all, up for grabs, the Bush camp then had no response to the candidacy of Mr Perot, the Texan billionaire now running as an independent. Mr Perot is the Bush campaign's worst nightmare. He obviously loathes Mr Bush, a transplant Texan, where Mr Perot is the real thing (these things matter). Though Mr Perot will not attack Mr Bush by name, he says enough about Mr Bush's failings--the snuggling up to Saddam Hussein before 1990, the inability to tackle the deficit--to let his supporters draw their own conclusions. All the early indications are that Mr Perot's core support is also Mr Bush's: moderate, older, Republicans. If he is to distinguish himself from Mr Perot, Mr Bush is going to have to do what he does with least conviction, which is to pretend he is a red-blooded conservative. Running as a conservative, Mr Bush will have to be implacably opposed to abortion: but the pro-choice Republicans are better organised this year than ever before.
Even given the presence of Mr Buchanan and Mr Perot, Mr Bush might have got through 1992 were it not for the third stumble. He might have been all right--the economy is, after all, now ticking along quite nicely--if Something Bad had not happened. But the riots in Los Angeles at the beginning of May were really bad, and Mr Bush's now-tough-now-tender reaction to them has convinced few (large majorities in the polls blame Mr Bush and Ronald Reagan for the state of the cities). Although most Americans do not live in the cities, and so might be presumed to care little about them, the riots alarmed them. They reminded people that 12 years of Republican administrations had failed to cure manifold social ills.
The consequence of those three stumbles is that the presidential election suddenly looks a fight. If, as everyone assumed in 1991, the face was going to be a cakewalk for Mr Bush, then the question at the beginning of this article would not have been worth asking. But in today's circumstances, does a 67-year-old man with Graves disease really want to fight a bitter six-month campaign? Is he so sure in his own mind that he knows what he would want to do with a second term that he will put up with the possible ignominy of such a campaign? Put that way, the question deserves an answer."

If the crowds that took to the streets against him have their way, Thai politics will now change both for ever and for the better.
Their agenda is clear: to punish those responsible for the killing and to reform the structure of power so that such a horror can never recur. That means curbing the power of the army, including its hold on the country's radio and television stations, and strengthening the constitutional authority of civilian institutions.
The case for reform has never been stronger. Thailand suffers neither the external threat of communism nor any internal polarisation of left and right. These were used by the generals as the excuse for their ferocious clampdown on the previous democracy movement in 1976. The troops who opened fire last week were defending generals whose notion of their place in society has become an anachronism.
But to be out-of-date does not guarantee extinction. Although a check on the army's penchant for impromptu political meddling may be needed to restore Thailand's attractions for foreign investors and tourists, weaknesses in the political system may yet help the army to resist.
Indeed, although General Suchinda's demise marks a first step in checking the army, by the time it came his resignation appeased no one. The full death toll is not yet known and fresh revelations of army brutality as investigations continue are fanning the flames of public outrage. Neutral observers believe about 100 died, but the Metropolitan Police Bureau has reported 589 people missing, and many Thais assume most of them are dead.
To make matters worse, the small clique of General Suchinda's closest military associates are still in positions of power. Popular demands that others should share responsibility for the killings are directed at four leaders: the armed forces' supreme commander, the army commander, the commander of troops in the capital and the minister of the interior.
""If they don't go, the demonstrations will continue. People cannot forget what they have seen,"" says a Thai military analyst. Yet they show no sign of stepping down nor any sign of remorse; on the contrary, a message this week from the supreme commander, Marshal Kaset Rojananil, and the army commander, General Issarapong Noonpackdee (who is also General Suchinda's brother-in-law), praised troops for their restraint.
Meanwhile, the political parties seem to many to be as much a part of the problem as the solution. Businessmen say that Thailand will not produce a strong and stable government to revive confidence in the crisis-damaged economy until after fresh elections. The parties, anxious to spare themselves the expense of a new poll only two months after the last, prefer to bargain among themselves for a cabinet reshuffle.
Their self-interest does not inspire confidence. The five-party coalition that backed General Suchinda's accession to the prime ministership is denounced by many as the ""old whisky dictatorship"", implicated in a slaughter that it did nothing to avert. Yet the parties continue to form the government on the basis of a narrow majority in parliament.
The speaker of the lower house on May 26th called on them to step aside in favour of a government of national reconciliation. Unabashed by the popular outcry against them, they have been trying to stay where they are, bringing in one more party to shore up their majority. Failure would let General Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the National Aspiration Party, the biggest opposition group, make his own bid for power.
While the parties manoeuvre, the pressure of popular anger has helped to produce some early efforts at reform. As crowds gathered outside parliament on May 25th to chant ""Where are the murderers?"" a joint session of elected MPs and appointed senators inside passed with unusual speed the first two readings of constitutional amendments to curb some of the army's powers.
The amendments meet some of the demands that brought protesters out against the unelected General Suchinda in the first place. One will restrict the prime ministership to an elected MP; another will reduce the power of the army-dominated Senate to block the will of the lower house. MPs say both amendments will easily pass their third and final readings next week.
This still leaves the contentious matter of the executive decree signed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej and issued by General Suchinda as his last act in power. This gives an amnesty to all soldiers for their role in crushing the demonstrations. Parliament has referred the matter to a constitutional tribunal to determine its validity.
If the tribunal decides the amnesty is valid, MPs and senators will have to vote on whether it should stand. MPs from the ruling coalition--two of the parties are closely linked to the army--plead that scrapping the amnesty may provoke a fresh military crackdown. Many officers had little sympathy for General Suchinda's group and even less for the brutal suppression it produced but they may close ranks against any attempt to take revenge on the army.
Opposition MPs for their part want parliament to appoint an investigating commission, with its findings used as the basis for subsequent prosecutions. Certainly, failure to bring those responsible for the bloodshed to account could generate a fresh round of mass protests. Unhappily, if that led to another confrontation with the army, the outcome would probably be even bloodier than last week's."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224147262/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/16?accountid=14657,"Why, when the state-run press trumpets the calls of China's senior leader, Den Xiaoping, for faster opening to the outside world, should officials in Beijing harass foreign journalists? To the official mind, the answer is obvious. As China opens up, foreign journalists will seek and acquire information they should not have and will use it to foster ""peaceful evolution""--Chinese--speak for western--style democracy.
At a recent meeting on ""the task of keeping secrets"", Qiao Shi, who is both a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and the head of China's secret police, explained that ""after reform and opening began, contact with foreigners grew, and gave rise to a new situation, making demands on our task of keeping secrets...We must make our task of keeping secrets serve the cause of reform and opening and economic construction.""
In other words, foreign journalists wanting to write about ""the cause of reform"" will find their every move monitored by the State Security Bureau--hence the black Mercedes spotted in the rearview mirror or the young pedestrian in jeans and T-shirt operating a camera hidden inside a travel bag. Such monitors proved their worth in the efficient roundup of student activists that followed the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Since no responsible journalist wants to endanger a source, the security men's appearance is one way of limiting contacts between foreigners and Chinese.
Another way is to limit a journalist's freedom to travel. Correspondents based in Beijing are regularly denied permission to travel to even the most open of towns, such as the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Few have ever been allowed to visit the troubled regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. Officials in Beijing require a written list of questions before they will agree to be interviewed.
A third way is to intimidate the journalists directly. The New York Times correspondent, Nicholas Kristof, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry five times during April and May. He was given a ""severe warning"", just one step short of expulsion, and told he had slandered China's government and distorted events.
On April 31st the BBC's correspondent, James Miles, was detained by police for six hours after trying to interview a British member of Parliament who was staging a brief demonstration in Tiananmen Square. When Mr Miles asked which law he had broken, the Foreign Ministry referred him to Article 14 of the regulations governing foreign journalists: ""Foreign journalists and permanent offices of foreign news agencies shall not engage in activities which are incompatible with their status or tasks, or which endanger China's national security, unity or community and public interests."" Warnings under Article 14 were also given to two German reporters.
Perhaps the most ominous incident came on May 17th when plain-clothed agents searched the Washington Post office and interrogated the paper's correspondent, Lena Sun, for three hours while holding her husband and two-year-old son at home without access to their embassy. The agents confiscated papers from Ms Sun's safe, including what they described as ""ten confidential documents"", and gave her a ""severe warning"", again citing Article 14. In China even divorce statistics are officially regarded as state secrets.
At the press conference later given by the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, journalists pressed for a clarification of their position. All Mr Wu would say, time and again, was that ""as long as they abide by Chinese laws and regulations, foreign journalists should have nothing to worry about."" Perhaps Mr Wu had been reading George Orwell."

But at least it became clear this week that the next president of the 7,100-island archipelago will be Fidel Ramos. Mr Ramos, though, has refused to claim victory at this stage. There are rules to be followed in the count, he said, culminating in a proclamation by Congress. He would wait to see if he was the one to be proclaimed.
People tend to regard this attitude as a sign of Mr Ramos's steadiness. Businessmen say he is breaking with the country's excitable past, in which individualism and capriciousness have accompanied poor economic growth. The next six years, they forecast, will be different.
The slow counting has allowed time for claims of cheating to grow. But the Catholic church, the army and most politicians have decided the election was the cleanest in memory. One who disagrees is Miriam Defensor Santiago. When it became clear that, at best, she was going to be the runner-up, she shouted fraud and dashed off a letter to George Bush. She then booked into a luxurious hospital to begin a fast ""to the death"". Far from winning sympathy, she was criticised for inviting foreign intervention in the country's domestic affairs. On its third day she called off the fast.
Right from the start of the count Mr Ramos, a former general and the personal choice of the retiring president, Corazon Aquino, had led the field of seven candidates. Mrs Santiago and Eduardo ""Danding"" Cojuangco took turns in second and third place. The outgoing speaker of the House of Representatives, Ramon Mitra, the widow of ex-President Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda Marcos, and the former Senate president, Jovito Salonga, followed. The incumbent vice-president, Salvador ""Doy"" Laurel, never got his campaign started, and was a dismal tail-ender.
Mr Ramos's share of the vote may look thin for a strong presidency. The population of the Philippines is 64m, with 32m registered voters. The 80% voter turnout yielded about 25m votes. Mr Ramos's tally is expected to be about 25%, giving him just over 6m votes. But as authority and publicity are heaped on the winner, the actual tally will be forgotten. Mrs Santiago's antics have made Mr Ramos look even stronger and wiser. So did those of Mrs Marcos. She looks like getting 10% of the vote, but she took the shine off this respectable showing by claiming she was cheated not only of the election, but also out of a bullet-proof bra, underpants and thousands of pairs of shoes she had left behind in the presidential palace when she fled into exile with Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
Most people have unreservedly accepted Mr Ramos as president. Like almost all Filipinos, he has a nickname, Eddie. Inevitably, that is now Steady Eddie."

Since April 15th, when the former president went into hiding, apparently somewhere in Kabul, at least three men feel they have replaced him in importance.
General Abdul Rashid Dostam was Mr Najibullah's closest ally. His men had fought the mujahideen guerrillas more fiercely than any other government unit since the Soviet troops left the country three years ago. In March the general switched sides. He joined forces with the mujahideen in Mazar-i-Sharif. After that, support for the Najibullah government collapsed; Kabul soon welcomed both General Dostam and the guerrillas.
The general's main new ally is Ahmad Shah Masoud, who gained fame during the civil war as a resourceful commander. Together, General Dostam and Mr Masoud have been preventing the forces of another mujahideen leader, Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, from taking over in Kabul. Mr Hikmatyar was the recipient of huge amounts of aid from Pakistan during the civil war, although the Pakistanis are now starting to feel they have backed the wrong man.
This was the background to this week's developments in Afghanistan. On May 25th Mr Masoud and Mr Hikmatyar signed an accord to end the fighting. In return for Mr Hikmatyar's promise to stop shelling Kabul, Mr Masoud said that he would get General Dostam to take his men out of the capital. Finally, it was agreed to hold a presidential election within six months.
It sounds wonderful. But will it work? Can Mr Masoud, who is now defence minister, keep order in Kabul without General Dostam's men? Probably not. Despite the accord signed this week, Mr Masoud continues to regard Mr Hikmatyar with deep suspicion and believes he will continue to try to seize power for himself in Kabul. Neither is it certain that General Dostam's men will leave. They remain the most powerful force in the country. The previous week Afghanistan's figurehead president, Sibghatullah Mujaddidi, gave the general an extra star and said, in effect, that he had been a supporter of the mujahideen all along, despite killing thousands of them. That may seem odd, but the president was merely acknowledging the general's strength.
As for having a presidential election in six months, this seems like wild optimism, if the voting is to mean anything. Two years was previously thought to be the minimum time in which to prepare an electoral roll and make the other arrangements necessary for an election. Mr Mujaddidi is against an early poll, and said so during a visit to Pakistan on May 27th. He wants to stay as president, and objects to a proposal that he should step down at the end of June.
Afghanistan is, if anything, more divided than it was under Mr Najibullah. The emergence of three strong men, with more in the wings, may be a reflection of the way the country is going.
General Dostam wants Afghanistan to have a federal structure, with divisions in the north, south, west and east, based on the cities of Mazar-i-Sharif, Kandahar and Herat, with Kabul remaining the capital. The divisions could roughly follow tribal lines, with the Pathans in the south, the Hazaras and Uzbeks in the north, the Tajiks in the east and west. The provincial cities have always valued their independence. The mujahideen in Kandahar, who took over the city without fuss, are in no hurry to get involved with the squabbles in Kabul. Gul Agha, a mujahideen commander there, said only, ""We will have relations with Kabul, of course, as long as we are given our rights.""
While the great men argue, the ordinary people are trying to rebuild their lives. For years the government-controlled cities were cut off from the rebel-controlled countryside. The roads are busy again with people visiting relations they may not have seen for a decade. Because of better communications and a stronger currency, prices of food and other goods have fallen by half. Even in Kabul, normality is taking over. Looting has been far less than was predicted after the stripping of Khost last year. Kabul does have a crime wave, but, then, so do many cities elsewhere."

A week later, after a decade of ethnic warfare, assassinations, kidnapping and terrorism, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan ordered the army to go into the southern province of Sindh to ""clean up the mess"". On the face of it, this seems a sensible, even belated, decision. But many Pakistanis, including army officers, are nervous. They are worried that, if the need to restore order is sacrificed to the government's political interests, a worse mess may result.
Anarchy has been spreading in Sindh since 1979, when General Zia ul Haq executed the former prime minister; Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a Sindhi. When growing Sindhi nationalism led to a revolt in 1983, Zia sent the predominantly Punjabi army in to crush the militants. He also quietly encouraged the growth of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which represents Urdu-speaking refugees from India. They had long been at odds with local Sindhis and with the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) of Mr Bhutto. In time political rivalry turned into gun battles between Muhajirs, Sindhis, Pathans and Punjabis.
Bhutto's daughter, Benazir, accuses President Ishaq Khan of having stepped into Zia's boots. He ousted her from the prime ministership in 1990 and installed Jam Sadiq Ali, a PPP turncoat, as chief minister of Sindh. Sadiq terrorised the PPP, heightening the fury of Sindhis. Sindhi nationalism turned into separatism, and hundreds of youths fled to the forests on the banks of the Indus in the interior of the province and became politicised outlaws. By the time Sadiq died two months ago, the state's writ had ceased to run in the countryside.
The president might have taken the opportunity of Sadiq's demise to replace his discredited administration with one that had local support. But he refused to allow Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, a former prime minister, to put together a government in Sindh which would have the backing of Miss Bhutto, the real force in the province. Instead he selected Muzaffar Shah, a nonentity; and now he is sending in the army.
The constitution allows the army to ""come to the aid of civil power"". But the legitimacy of bringing in the army depends on the legitimacy of the civil power; and there is some doubt about that in both Karachi and the capital Islamabad. Many Pakistanis believe that Mr Sharif did not win the 1990 elections fairly. Nor do they see the president as the non-partisan head of state he is supposed to be. And in Karachi the appointed Mr Shah can claim no electoral legitimacy. The army, if used to prop up such a questionable civil power, might antagonise the Sindhis as much as in 1983.
Many army officers are worried by this prospect. They also say they are disturbed by the government's refusal to give the army sweeping powers under Article 245 of the constitution. This provision allows the president to suspend the normal process of law and prevent the judiciary from interfering in the army's operations.
Soldiers everywhere usually want sweeping powers, undisturbed by the prying eyes of judges, and Pakistan's soldiers usually want to run the country. So some suspicion is in order. Yet in this instance Pakistan's soldiers may be right to suspect that the president's refusal to give them carte blanche is a symptom not of the government's concern for civil rights, but of its intention to use the army for political ends.
The explanation lies in the fact that among the separatists and PPP extremists in the province are others connected to the MQM and to the provincial administration. If the army were to march through the province sweeping up all outlaws and terrorists, some of the government's friends might suffer. Without co-operative judges, the government would have difficulty in protecting the lawbreakers who are on its side.
The army is in a difficult position. If it bows to Islamabad and goes after only anti-government Sindhis, its name will be mud in the province. But if it does not, Mr Shah's government may fall, the MQM will probably leave Mr Sharif's coalition in Islamabad and the central government will then be at risk. Does the army really want that?"

On May 22nd Morihiro Hosokawa, the former governor of Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyushu, registered a new political party, the New Japan Party (it sounds better in Japanese). Its aim is to decentralise a government that Mr Hosokawa calls ""rigid, outmoded and yoked to vested interests"". It is unlikely to succeed. But many people in provincial Japan would like to see it try and may well support it in the election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament) on July 26th.
Mr Hosokawa, grandson of a pre-war prime minister and the 18th-generation head of an aristocratic family, must first find some candidates. Household names such as Akio Morita, the founder and chairman of Sony, and various media types have been touted as possible candidates (they have not, it should be added, put themselves forward). With the polls emphasising popular disenchantment with all the main political parties, Mr Hosokawa's new group could easily garner 3m-4m votes--allowing it to take four or five upper-house seats from the Liberal Democrats.
That may not sound much. But it is enough to alarm the ruling party. Three years ago, in the wake of the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal, the Trade Union Confederation set up Rengo-no-Kai to fight the last upper-house election (half of the 252 seats are contested every three years). To the Liberal Democrats' consternation, 11 of the 12 Rengo candidates won hands down, and so helped to deprive the ruling party of the majority it had held in the upper house for the previous 34 years.
Ever since, despite the LDP's comfortable majority in the more powerful lower house, the opposition has been able to frustrate much of the government's legislation. Last year the LDP sacked Toshiki Kaifu, a popular prime minister who might have won the party an upper-house victory, and replaced him with Kiichi Miyazawa. He has since proved so maladroit that the party now knows it will be 1995 at the earliest before it can regain a majority. In the meantime it must make do by greasing palms and making deals.
The opposition parties have mostly gone along with this cosy arrangement. But not the Communists and, more importantly, not Rengo. With a grassroots organisation and 8m paid-up members, the trade unions have refused to be bought off. In the run-up to this year's upper-house election, Rengo has twice trounced the LDP in by-elections--and is expected to gain further upper-house seats come July. Not surprisingly, nobbling Rengo has become the Liberal Democrats' obsession.
Is Mr Hosokawa's party a Rengo in the making? Politically, they could not be further apart. The 54-year-old Mr Hosokawa was an LDP member of the upper house for 12 years before spending eight years as governor of his ancestral prefecture. Many believe the aristocrat has blundered by arrogantly turning against his old friends and political allies. ""As lord of the manor,"" say LDP stalwarts, ""he wants to ride in the palanquin.""
Maybe so, but in its short existence, Mr Hosokawa's party has attracted plenty of well-wishers from outside the LDP. Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the small but respected Democratic Socialist Party, has praised Mr Hosokawa for breaking away from the political mainstream. So has Osamu Shibuya, leader of the New Wave ginger group within the Social Democratic Party. Both opposition groups say they are prepared to work closely with Mr Hosokawa's party if he gets some of his candidates into parliament. The Buddhist-affiliated Komeito (Clean Government Party) is less sure. With financial scandals of its own to hide, the Komeito is as worried as the LDP about the electoral damage that a prissily clean party like Mr Hosokawa's may inflict.
Some suspicious folk meanwhile maintain that the New Japan Party is really nothing more than a secret Liberal Democratic plot to thwart Rengo. Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and one of the triumvirate that runs the LDP, is an old friend of Mr Hosokawa's. Rumours persist that the two of them are colluding to deny Rengo the support that it might otherwise expect in this July's poll. But conspiracy theories come ten-a-penny in Tokyo, and this one--even if correct--still leaves the Liberal Democrats in a bind."

Theoretically, yes. Australia's population has doubled over the past 40 years and is growing twice as fast as the rest of the OECD's. It took 70 years from the first European settlement in 1788 to reach a population of 1m. The most recent million took only 46 months, and over half of them were immigrants--mostly from Asia.
Against this background, Gerry Hand, the minister for immigration, announced in mid-May that the number of immigrants to be admitted in the financial year beginning on July 1st 1992 will be 80,000, down from 111,000 the previous year, and from the 145,300 who arrived in 1988-89. The only surprise, he argues, is that the cut did not happen sooner, given that a tenth of Australia's workers have no jobs and the economy has only recently begun to emerge from a 15-month recession.
For its part, the opposition Liberal Party wants a ""more realistic immigration programme"", which means a still sharper cut in the numbers admitted. It also wants immigrants with skills to be preferred to those who happen to have relations in Australia.
That suggestion may make economic sense, but the ruling Labor Party is tuned to politics. Within the 80,000 quota, it has reserved 45,000 places for relations; 24,000 for people with needed skills; and the rest for humanitarian cases. Recent immigrants have found work mainly in unionised manufacturing industries, particularly textiles and cars. Union members want a guarantee that the rest of their families will be allowed into Australia; their shop stewards want a source of new recruits. This explains why the unions, on which Labor depends, support immigration during the recession.
Some other Australians, however, want to stop immigration. Environmental groups argue that Australia has inadequate water supplies for a population much greater than its present 17.3m. Fringe groups, among them the neo-Nazi Australian Nationalist Movement, based in Perth, and the League of Rights, argue that immigration is bad if it means more Asians.
The striking thing, however, is that even a whiff of racism can hurt a mainstream politician's career. In 1988 John Howard lost the Liberal leadership after publishing ""One Australia"", which argued that the pace of immigration was too fast.
Today Mr Howard insists that he has never opposed Asian immigration. What he does not like is the government's policy of ""multi-culturalism"", which includes paying for the interpreters in Sydney: ""I don't like hyphenated Australians and I do not think it should be conscious national policy to encourage ethnic differences."" Mr Hand says the money is piffling and the policy works. At this year's Yugoslav festival in Victoria, Slovenes, Serbs, Croats and Macedonians behaved as the ""best of mates"".
The minister may be right. In 1984 Geoffrey Blainey, an Australian historian, predicted growing resentment at a ""myriad of little things"": the smell of goat's meat, noodles drying on the clothes-line and phlegm on the footpath. Instead, most Australians seem intent on enjoying the better food the immigrants have brought with them."

Israel has not mounted a spectacular military operation against any of its many enemies there. Over the past fortnight, it is true, Hizbullah, the ""Party of God"", has launched more attacks than usual on Israeli positions in South Lebanon. The Israelis have also stepped up their raids across the border. But there has been nothing really big; nothing, that is to say, to match the explosion at Israel's embassy in Buenos Aires in March.
A lot of Middle-East watchers feel jumpy. To understand why, it is necessary to go back more than three months to February 16th, when Israeli helicopters ambushed a convoy taking Sheikh Abbas Mussawi, a leader of Hizbullah, away from a political rally in Jibchit, on the edge of the ""security zone"" Israel maintains inside Lebanon (see map).(Map Omitted) The sheikh was killed, along with his wife, son and bodyguards.
Like its Iranian mentor, Hizbullah considers itself permanently at war with Israel, but seems to have treated the murder of its top man as the crossing of a red line. Vowing revenge, it took a first helping right away, by firing hundreds of rockets into northern Israel. Israel responded by sending infantry into the villages of Yaatar and Kafra. After two days of fighting, the rocket barrages stopped, possibly because the Syrians, who keep an army in Lebanon, were afraid that the fighting might spread.
The Israelis, however, were not yet off the hook. On March 17th unidentified bombers blew up Israel's embassy in Buenos Aires, killing many people and reducing much of the building to rubble. Since Israel invests heavily in embassy security, this was a heavy blow. Immediately afterwards, at the invitation of Argentina's President Carlos Menem, agents from Israel's Mossad and from the American Central Intelligence Agency converged on Buenos Aires to track down the killers. So far the bombers, whoever they were, have not been caught.
On April 6th the Israelis were hit again, this time right inside the security zone they occupy in Lebanon. Three Arabs who had infiltrated the zone ambushed an Israeli military convoy, killing two soldiers before being killed themselves. The daring and careful planning of this attack impressed the Israeli army: it said afterwards that the guerrillas had probably intended to kill the head of its northern command, who had been travelling with the convoy shortly before the ambush. In Hizbullah's eyes, that might have seemed a fitting reply to the killing of its sheikh.
The Israelis are not famous for sitting back and accepting punishment. Yet it took an even more daring raid, on May 19th, before their patience snapped. In this attack Hizbullah guerrillas overran a position of Israel's local Lebanese allies, the South Lebanon Army, on the northern edge of the security zone. It was the first time since 1988 that Hizbullah had mounted such a large and successful operation, in which SLA prisoners were captured.
This was too much for Israel to bear: in the past week and a half, Israeli attacks have come thick and fast. A helicopter fired a missile at the house of a Hizbullah commander in Jibchit, killing him and his family. Other attacks, by helicopters and bombers, have struck at Hizbullah positions in the villages of Dirdghaya and Majdal-Silm. And on May 21st the Israeli air force carried out an unusual attack on the village of Janta, high up in the Bekaa Valley a few kilometres from the Syrian border.
The Janta attack was the one that mattered. Unlike the Palestinian guerrillas before 1982, Hizbullah has no big bases or positions in the south. Its main concentrations are in the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, firmly under Syrian control and covered by an umbrella of Syrian anti-aircraft missiles. Hizbullah raids conducted in the south generally originate from there, usually with guidance and intelligence provided by local supporters. Bombing Janta was a message to Syria to reign in Hizbullah--which fought doggedly on, ambushing Israeli troops in the security zone, and killing one on May 27th.
Israeli and Syrian soldiers have glared at one another across no-man's-land for more than 40 years. None of the wars they have fought has started by accident. So why are the Middle-East watchers so jumpy?
The answer is in the pattern of recent months. Since the assassination of Sheikh Mussawi it is Hizbullah that has taken the initiative, Israel that has been forced to respond. Nothing Israel has yet done looks like an answer to Buenos Aires. Perhaps it is biding its time. A military spectacular, just before the Israeli election on June 23rd, might go down a treat with the voters. Some time after the embassy bombing, incidentally, an official from the American State Department blamed Iran."

Just as Brazil was polishing itself up to receive more than 100 heads of government for the Earth summit, starting on June 3rd in Rio de Janeiro, President Femando Collor de Mello was accused by his brother of corruption.
Pedro Collor de Mello, who at 39 is three years younger than the president, vented his sibling ire on May 24th, in an interview published in Veja, Brazil's leading newsweekly. Pedro accused Fernando of being a secret partner in illicit deals with a prosperous entrepreneur from the family's home state of Alagoas, in north-eastern Brazil. The businessman in question, Paulo Cesar Farias, was treasurer of Fernando Collor's successful election campaign in 1989.
This was the fourth time in recent months that Veja has given space to attacks by Pedro Collor on Mr Farias. Each has cut a little closer to the president. Unlike its forerunners, the latest assault evoked a response. Fernando Collor ordered police and tax authorities to investigate the allegations, offered to give evidence and said he would sue his brother for criminal libel.
In a five-minute address to the nation the president, dressed uncharacteristically in shirtsleeves--and spitting Pedro's name with anger--apologised to Brazilians for his brother's ""foolish and false"" declarations, promising to defend Brazil's democracy ""over and above my family, my suffering and my pain."" Brazilian congressmen agonised before deciding to mount a commission, on the Watergate model, to investigate the president. For democrats the problem is acute: Mr Collor is the first directly elected president after 26 years of military dictatorship and transition. Columnists have agonised over the advisability of resignation, and speculated that the president may not finish his five-year term.
Pedro Collor's supposed motive in unleashing a family feud at this most delicate of moments for his brother was to save the family newspaper by doing down Mr Farias. With a circulation of just 10,000, the paper is only a small part of the lucrative Collor media chain in Alagoas, of which Pedro has been the director. Last year Mr Farias announced his intention to open a competing daily. The president apparently did not share his brother's determination to keep Mr Farias out of the market. So the resentful Pedro collected what he called his ""dossier"" and gave it to Veja. Documents are said to show that Mr Farias failed to pay his taxes and operated a number of undeclared overseas businesses; Mr Farias, confronted by Veja, denied it all.
Pedro Collor said his brother was taking profits from Mr Farias's allegedly illegal businesses, and helping him build a rival voice in Alagoas, over which the president would have full political control. For spice, Pedro claimed that Fernando had introduced him to cocaine when both were teenagers. This, says the president, is a libel. The Collors' elderly mother Leda, the family company's majority stockholder, in mid-May removed Pedro temporarily from directing the business.
In this tangled tale, Brazil's sophisticated and competitive press has shown its newfound muscle. Eager snooping had already turned up case after case of corruption in the Collor government--though nothing out of the ordinary for Brazil's mammoth state bureaucracy. The main effect so far had been to force the president to honour his campaign promises for reform. But in its attack on the president himself, Veja gave space to charges from an interesting but offended source, yet made little apparent effort to verify them.
The excitement will probably be dissipated for a while in the investigations. The charges might have carried more weight had they not been made at such a tender moment. But the falling-out in the first family illuminates a flaw in this huge but stalled country. Brazilians' national political purposes tend to be so vague and weakly held that they are easily overwhelmed by narrow provincial interests."

European governments collect more than $50 from every barrel of oil that their citizens burn. That seems lucrative besides the $15 a barrel in profits and monopoly rent that the governments of even the most efficient producers, such as Saudi Arabia, wring out of the system. Yet the Europeans have recently been toying with a carbon tax that would add a further $10 a barrel to today's tax revenues by 2000. Saudi Arabia's furious response? For the first time in years, the West's friend in OPEC began to talk up oil prices.
The first signs that anything unusual was afoot came in Vienna in mid-May when Saudi Arabia, which over the past few years has consistently stood for moderate oil prices, failed to insist that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) should increase its output quotas in line with expected demand. The OPEC meeting broke up with quotas unchanged at 23m barrels a day (b/d). On its own that would not have had much effect on prices, but rumours soon spread that the Saudis had changed their oil policy and that they now wanted to see prices rise by $3 a barrel, to match the effect of the first step in the EC's new carbon-tax plan.
After months of dull markets, oil traders enjoyed a few days frantic enough to be briefly reminiscent of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Brent crude, which is used to set prices for other types of oil, rose above $20 a barrel for the first time this year. Futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by more than $1 to $22 a barrel. Drawing on a warning from Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, delivered at a meeting between the EC and the Gulf Co-operation Council in mid-May, experts bean to talk of an aggressive new Saudi outlook.
So far, all this sets a new balance not of supply and demand, merely of talk and rumour. The world can just about get by without extra OPEC oil--partly because the usual cheating on quotas by the cartel's members means that they produce about lm b/d more than OPEC says they should; and partly because Kuwait is rapidly starting to export again. On the other hand it would be easy enough for Saudi Arabia to squeeze the price by cutting its production a bit. For once, such a gesture could not quickly be undermined by others, because there is little spare capacity among other producers that could be called upon without permanently damaging their oil wells.
There are rumours that Saudi Arabia has indeed been restricting supply; that it has been shipping crude oil not to its usual customers, but into storage in the Caribbean and in Europe. Yet even if that turns out to be so, it leaves the question whether it represents a genuine change in policy or merely a gesture to remind the EC that Saudi oil cannot be taken for granted.
In fact it is unlikely that the Saudis have changed policies, if only because the last time they tried to sustain high prices, in the early 1980s, they lost a share of the market to other producers. If, then, the Saudis have merely been posturing, there must be a strong prospect that the oil price will fall back. In any event, while the Saudis were talking up prices, EC environment ministers withdrew their support for the commission's idea of a carbon tax, partly because of American pressure. Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment commissioner, said in a huff that he would boycott the Earth summit in Rio. Saudi Arabia and America will be delighted about the tax; they despise carbon taxes and are the joint architects of stable oil prices since the Gulf war."

If you really want trouble, tint the windows. On May 4th, a few days after the riots in Los Angeles, crowds rampaged in Toronto. A march had been organised to protest at the Rodney King verdict in Los Angeles as well as a local encounter between a black man and Toronto police. The crowd marched peacefully for a while, but then parts of it turned violent.
In Toronto, unlike Los Angeles, no one was seriously injured in the riot. But whereas Rodney King had been badly beaten, the black man in Toronto, who had been armed with a knife but no gun, had been shot and killed. The policeman who shot him claims to have been threatened with the knife, and to have fired a warning shot first. But Toronto's black organisations are unimpressed. In the past four years seven other blacks, three of them unarmed, have been shot by police in and around Toronto. One had been stealing a car; the policemen involved said they thought the car thief was trying to run them over.
Canadians like to observe how little violence and racism exists in their country, compared with the United States. That is still true, but the contrast is less stark than it used to be. Although no national statistics on shooting by the police are kept, and no breakdown by colour of the people shot, blacks in several Canadian cities say they feel themselves under siege by predominantly white--and increasingly racist--police forces.
Montreal is still troubled by the ramifications of an incident last year. Police on the lookout for a black man wanted for attempted murder stopped the car of an unarmed man who, apart from being black, bore no resemblance to the man they were seeking. They thereupon shot him in the head, allegedly because he moved after being told to freeze. Radio transcripts from the incident are sprinkled with references to ""niggers"" and ""darkies"".
Montreal's police chief ordered an internal investigation, which showed that his men could not have botched things more thoroughly. When he said so publicly earlier this year, half of Montreal's police force marched through the city, demanding the resignation not of the policeman who erred but of the chief who had failed to stand up for his man on the beat. The only punishment for the policeman responsible was to be moved to a desk job. This month a coroner's inquest into the case concluded there was ""a totally unacceptable"" level of racism in the Montreal force.
The incidents in Montreal and Toronto may at least be prompting some change. Policing in both cities is to be examined by new task-forces on race relations. One day after the Toronto disturbances, moreover, the justice minister announced that the government would be making unspecified changes to the ""fleeing-felon rule"", which under the present criminal code allows police to shoot at any suspect trying to get away, no matter how trivial the crime. In some places local directives are already more restrictive: in Edmonton, for example, police may resort to firearms only when there is ""reasonable and serious threat to life"". But the Police Association likes the fleeing-felon rule as it is.
Minority groups argue that Canada's policing will not improve until the police recruit more non-white officers. Vancouver seems to enjoy better race relations than cities in the east, and has opened a store-front police station in Chinatown, with Chinese-speaking staff--yet even there Chinese people get hit by policemen. In Montreal only seven out of nearly 200 officers hired in the past year were not white. A complaints commission has received 1,300 complaints about police abuse in Montreal and the rest of Quebec over the past two years. It has ruled on only 11 cases, in all of one of which it has found in favor of the police. Some Canadians are surprised to find that they are just like everybody else."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224171129/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/26?accountid=14657,"Looking better already after a heart operation last week, Chile's former dictator, the robust General Augusto Pinochet, shows every sign of soldiering on as head of his country's army. The trench of the 1980 constitution, written around and for him, shelters him in that job until 1997. But his presidential successor, Patricio Aylwin, has just lobbed in a grenade.
Last week President Aylwin proposed constitutional reforms, one of which would reduce the autonomy the armed services gave themselves before handing over power 1990. Under the present rules, the president may not get rid of incumbent service chiefs, or even of junior officers. The most he can do is refuse to approve promotions. As Mr Aylwin pointed out, the president--who has the title of supreme commander only in wartime--has no way of disciplining military subordinates.
That was precisely the point. Chile's armed forces, in General Pinochet's view, have an overriding duty to safeguard the constitution, so must be beyond the control of politicians who might threaten it. Until now Mr Aylwin's government has turned a blind eye to that issue. Should the reforms pass the senate (in which the ruling coalition does not have a majority), Mr Aylwin says he would not use his new powers, but would pass them on to his successor.
Yet a bolder approach, such as getting rid of the old general swiftly, would be good for soldiers as well as civilians. General Pinochet is an anachronism, an old cold-warrior surrounded by cronies. Recalling criticisms by the United States of his human rights record while in power, he has rejected recent American peace overtures, including offers of arms. He insists on employing and protecting former military-intelligence agents, who swell the army's ranks and strain its budget.
The armed forces were the only state institution not drastically streamlined by General Pinochet. Chile spent $1.26 billion on defence last year, about 4% of GDP, more than any of its neighbours. The law prescribes that 10% of the state's copper sales, which comes to around $300m each year, should go to the military budget, which may not be cut below the index-linked equivalent of its 1989 level. More than 70% goes on personnel, leaving little for buying arms and maintaining equipment. The army, in particular, is top-heavy, with 22,000 officers and NCOs to 30,000 recruits.
With better planning, the forces could get better value for money. But there is little co-ordination among the services, and the joint chief of staff are powerless. Old rules favour the army and the navy to the detriment of the air force, which gets less than a quarter of the resources. General Pinochet and his army colleagues treat any suggestion of debate, much less defence cuts, as something between high treason and lese-majeste'. But they can hardly avoid talking to civilians about budgetary matters.
Moreover, South America's soldiers see good reasons for more contact with each other. Many Chilean officers take the invasion of Panama in 1989 as evidence that the United States has grown more willing to intervene in their part of the world; their Brazilian counterparts even hypothesised, in a private seminar last year, that an American led multinational force might invade the Amazon region, in the name of humanity, to stop deforestation and stabilise the world's climate. There is a general fear that American hegemony will restrict access to technology; Argentina's Condor-II rocket programme was scrapped as a result of American pressure, and the Americans and French have refused to sell Brazil a guidance system for space rockets.
In particular, South American military men dislike the way the United States chooses to fight drugs, with the emphasis on trying to stop production in the south, rather than on reducing consumption in the north. Many are unwilling to get involved in what they see as a job for policemen, not soldiers. All this tends to make for scratchily anti-gringo feelings, by no means shared by the new breed of South American political leaders.
With the worldwide collapse of radical politics, South American generals can no longer boost their claim for larger budgets by citing the need for defence against revolutionary neighbours. The generals must learn to debate, and to lobby, on more sophisticated grounds. The old drill-sergeant at the head of Chile's army has neither the training nor the taste for that."

A ceasefire signed in February remains unbroken. But El Salvador's troubles have not ended. Worried United Nations peacekeepers say the timetable for a settlement has already slipped two months behind schedule, and are pushing both sides to move faster.
The timetable said that the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front should disarm a fifth of its 7,000-strong rebel army on May 1st. Instead, the front accused the government of breaking promises, which included legalising the FMLN as a political party, abolishing two of the nastier parts of the security forces (the national guard and the treasury police) and creating a new civilian police force. Recruiting for the new police force will begin in June, and the men will start being trained in July.
In the interim the rebels refuse to disarm, and businessmen on that account continue to boycott talks on the economy. An obscure right-wing movement calling itself the ""Civic Movement for a Free El Salvador"" is placing radio advertisements saying that, if the accords are implemented, it will signify the political, economic and social collapse of the country.
""The explosion of peace has given way to a reluctance to come to terms with reality,"" says Ruben Zamora, vice-president of parliament and a leading voice on the left. Tempers are fraying on both sides. The president, Alfredo Cristiani, has critics on the right of his ruling ARENA party, who are eager to prevent the incorporation of the FMLN into normal political life. Yet most people are confident that the problems can be overcome.
For example, a rebel officer was shot five times in the street last week, and survived. Amid a flurry of accusations, the FMLN pulled out of the peace talks for four days. It then turned out that the shooting might have been part of an ordinary crime. President Cristiani promised a thorough investigation, and the talking began again. Little by little, both sides are edging towards the idea of a state in which differing ideologies can coexist.
The optimism has a lot to do with Mr Cristiani's reputation for patient resolve, and with the acceptance on the left that Salvadoreans have no more stomach for war. In recent opinion polls 21% of those asked said they would vote for ARENA in an election, whereas only 16% said they would for vote the left, including a mere 4.3% of the FMLN. The economy is recovering. Government advisers predict 9% growth this year, car sales are up and new housing, for people returning from the United States, is sprouting in the outskirts of the capital.
The country has a lot of catching up to do. It is, for example, desperately short of water and electricity. Poor rains last year, and none so far this year, have drained the reservoirs of a system all of whose power is hydroelectric. Rationing already means six-hour daytime power cuts. No wonder there is little enthusiasm for going back to war."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224171449/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/28?accountid=14657,"Outsiders who believe that something must be done to end the cruelties of the civil war in Bosnia & Hercovina are getting round to doing something, late in the day but more firmly than some would like. Whether it will work is another question. Mediation has failed. Armed intervention to stop the fighting, which is what ""peacekeeping"" at this stage would amount to, is politically unacceptable. Attempts to get food and medicine to the besieged people of Sarajevo have, so far, collapsed in hijacking and bomb-throwing, like the mortar attack that killed a score of people queuing for bread on May 27th. The remaining option, which the world is now in the process of accepting, is to press Serbia, through sanctions, into restraining its culpable Serb irregulars in Bosnia.
The European Community and the United Nations have been coyly circling each other, each wanting the other to make the first move. Now, propelled by a blast from America's secretary of state, the EC has been shamed into breaking a stale routine.
On May 27th the EC ambassadors agreed to impose a small package of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining rump of the Yugoslav federation, without waiting for the UN to do the same. The toughest measure is a trade embargo, excluding medicine and basic necessities. In addition, the Community will freeze all export-credit guarantees and suspend scientific and technical co-operation (Spain, with the Barcelona Olympics about to take place, dissuaded the others from cutting sporting ties). The ambassadors' decision is final, needing no more than the rubberstamp approval of EC ministers, probably on June 1st, to come into effect.
Timing had been the trouble. Germany and Britain wanted the sanctions straight-away. France, with support from Greece and Spain, had wanted to wait for UN Cover, and backed its political caution with an economic argument. Sanctions, France argued, would be far more effective if they could be imposed by as many countries as possible: the EC alone accounts for 45% of Serbia's exports, and 40% of its imports, but only 10% of its oil imports. In the end, the Europeans decided to go it alone, but they excluded oil and oil products from their trade sanctions, urging the UN to take on that part of the job. It is not clear that it will immediately do so.
The background to Europe's sudden alacrity was James Baker's charge, on May 24th at a meeting in Lisbon, that Europe faced a nightmare but was inventing reasons for doing nothing about it. The Europeans could splutter about pots and kettles: until now the Americans have distanced themselves from the Yugoslav tragedy, taking no decisions or curious ones. The administration supported attempts to keep Yugoslavia together and was not much involved in its splitting apart. But with a convert's energy, America has managed to jerk the Europeans into action.
It must now turn its full attention to the UN Security Council. The council is expected to vote on May 29th, but at mid-week it was still at sixes and sevens.
The original idea had been for a series of graduated steps, starting with the suspension of air links. Several members, including America and Canada, have already cut theirs. Next could come an oil or trade embargo, the freezing of assets and the expulsion of Yugoslavia from international bodies such as the World Bank, the IMF and the United Nations itself. The new American ambassador to the UN, Edward Perkins, has already said that he does not accept that Serbia and Montenegro should automatically take Yugoslavia's seat; they should reapply, he says, and ""prove to the members of the UN that the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a peace-loving state.""
Now a more comprehensive measure may be passed, possibly in a couple of stages. But the votes are not yet safely in the bag. Of the council's five permanent members, China will probably go along with America, Britain and France, encouraged to be stern by Muslim governments, which are spreading anger and indignation at the suffering of Bosnian Muslims. Russia, even though it has little authority in the council these days, may urge caution, partly out of respect to its foreign minister, who is on a peace mission to the area. More important, the Russians have a deal with Serbia, swapping oil for agricultural goods, that they are reluctant to lose.
For this reason, oil sanctions may be postponed to a later stage. A different sort of self-punitive idea gaining ground in New York is that Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, should call for a non-stop peace conference jointly chaired by the UN and EC negotiators, Cyrus Vance and Lord Carrington.
On May 26th Mr Boutros Ghali received a letter from Yugoslavia's vice-president, Branco Kostic, disclaiming all responsibility for what is happening in Bosnia; the Yugoslav government and army, it said, were innocent and unfairly blamed. But the Serb militias in Bosnia are dependent on help from Belgrade--and, anyhow, nobody any longer believes what Serbia's leaders say.
The regime is preparing for its punishment in defiant mood. On May 31st the 10.5m citizens of newly reconstituted Yugoslavia go to the polls to elect a federal parliament. The authorities hope for a high turn out but the mainstream opposition parties have announced a boycott.
The government has hurried to tell people that sanctions, imposed or to come, will have no immediate effect. It has a point. Serbia and Montenegro are self-sufficient in food, rich in hydroelectric power and produce one-fifth of the oil they use. Since the war with Croatia, the Adriatic oil pipeline has been shut, and much of Serbia's imported oil now comes through Romania, which is expected, with some cynicism, to respond to instructions from the highest bidder. If assets are frozen, it may not be all that painful since a lot of money has been moved to Cyprus and Singapore.
Yet a trade embargo will hurt. The textile industry will be damaged, spare parts will dwindle and everybody (except the army?) will be affected if the UN bans oil sales. An air-flight ban would be a nuisance for the middle classes in Belgrade, hitherto relatively untouched by the wars. Nobody will like it if sporting links are eventually cut. But industries will adapt and people are rallying to the flag: the only recorded comment by President Slobodan Milosevic about sanctions is that the mild measures imposed before this week have had a ""stimulative effect""."

The streets of the Czech capital hum with foreign languages, new shops open every day, everywhere buildings and monuments are being restored.

Though appearances cannot tell the whole story--Prague has its problems, and Bratislava its successes--they do point to something deeper: free-market reforms are not affecting Czechoslovakia evenly. In the past two years the Czech Lands of Bohemia and Moravia, among the most industrially advanced regions of pre-war Europe, have attracted 96% of the $800m invested in Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile production in Slovakia's Soviet-oriented armaments factories, steel plants and mines slumped along with the Soviet market. Unemployment hovers near 4% in the Czech Lands, but has climbed above 12% in Slovakia.
Divided by their different economies, it is hardly surprising that candidates in Czechoslovakia's two parts who are preparing for the elections on June 5th and 6th (for the federal, Czech and Slovak parliaments) seem to be conducting two different campaigns. Regional differences are exaggerated by the myriad new political parties that have resulted from the fragmentation of the broad coalitions (Civic Forum in the Czech Lands, Public Against Violence in Slovakia) that were elected to parliament in 1990. Trying to stand out, the new parties have begun to use more radical language: pro-reform and anti-communist in the Czech Lands, anti-reform and nationalist in Slovakia. Although Czechoslovakia's 5% electoral hurdle will keep the smallest parties out of parliament, even the mainstream parties appear to be pulling the two halves of the country in opposite directions.
In Slovakia nationalist and left-wing parties look set to benefit from the distaste for ""Prague's"" free-market reforms. Some, like the pro-independence Slovak National Party, describe the government's privatisation programme as a Czech and foreign plot, designed to impoverish Slovakia. Others, like the federalist Social Democrats, led by Alexander Dubcek, and the former Communists, now called the Party of the Democratic Left, win support by advocating more state intervention, subsidies for industry and larger welfare benefits.
The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, the largest Slovak party, cleverly mixes both nationalist and left-wing ideas in its campaign. At one election meeting its candidates railed against foreign participation in Slovak privatisation, the withdrawal of state subsidies from Slovak factories and unemployment inflicted on Slovakia by Prague. The party's charismatic leader, Vladimir Meciar, a former Communist and former Slovak prime minister, says that ""sovereignty"" (the polls show that a majority of Slovaks support more of that, though not yet full independence) would allow Slovakia to design its own economic programme; some former Communists hope this means that they will return to power.
Mr Meciar's victory is not certain. Pro-reform Slovak parties, like the ruling Christian Democratic Movement (which also split recently), could benefit from growing suspicions of Mr Meciar, whose opinions change from week to week. Yet economic pain is pushing disillusioned Slovaks towards the Slovak nationalist left.
In Bohemia and Moravia, by contrast, the mainstream parties stand much further to the right. Indeed, to an outsider, the differences between the main four seem slight. The Civic Democratic Party, led by the forthright finance minister, Vaclav Klaus, styles itself as the new majority party and tries to appeal to impatient entrepreneurs. At election meetings, its supporters do not complain about economic pain, but rather ask why reforms cannot go faster.
The Civic Movement, led by Jiri Dienstbier, the much-loved foreign minister, talks more about human rights and presents itself as the party for nicer entrepreneurs, capitalists with human faces. The Civic Democratic Alliance has gained by depicting Mr Klaus as arrogant and calls itself a party for intellectual entrepreneurs; the small Christian Democratic Party, aligned to Mr Klaus's party, hopes to be supported by--what else?--Christian entrepreneurs.
All emerged directly out of Civic Forum (hence the similarity of names) and all support economic reform, privatisation, and foreign investment. To varying degrees, all support laws keeping former secret policemen and former Communist Party officials out of public office. Despite personal disagreements, all would probably co-operate in parliament.
All are also growing impatient with Slovakia. Though none openly supports division, their leaders wonder whether they want to take part in a Czechoslovak federal parliament where Slovak nationalists and leftists, united with Czech leftists (former Communists, plus the growing Social Democratic Party) could form a majority.
According to complicated Czechoslovak parliamentary rules, if the election produced such a majority, it might still be possible for a Czech right-wing group to block anti-reform legislation. But stalemate has plagued Czechoslovakia in recent months, despite President Vaclav Havel's attempts to end it. More of it is hardly what the country needs right now. Better to bring an end to the 74-year federation, say all the main pro-reform Czech parties, than to allow Slovak politicians to slow down the whole country. Given the numbers of parties, and the awkward mix of economic and national issues, compromise may prove difficult."

Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, sworn in as president on May 25th, was elected within 48 hours of the murder of Giovanni Falcone, Italy's leading anti-Mafia judge. Mr Scalfaro was a compromise candidate, acceptable to the three biggest parties in parliament. Agreement to choose him was reached after nearly two weeks of inconclusive voting, and against the background of Mr Falcone's funeral in Palermo cathedral.
The ceremony, transmitted live on national television, was a burning indictment of the inability of successive Italian governments to crush the Mafia. The dignitaries who attended the service to honour Mr Falcone, his wife and their three bodyguards, had to slip into church through a side door to avoid the jeers of an angry and tearful crowd in the cathedral square. Millions of Italians were moved by the grief and anger of the young widow of one of the dead policemen, berating her husband's killers. ""Too much blood,"" she wailed. ""You have spilled too much blood in this city!"" Many shared the fury of the relations and police officers who roundly abused the politicians in the congregation.
Mr Falcone's death was a spectacular, yet almost inevitable, assassination. ""I have an open account with Cosa Nostra,"" he confessed not long before he died, ""an account which will be settled only by my death."" No Italian investigator had done so much damage to the Sicilian Mafia, or Cosa Nostra, as its members call it. Thanks to the confessions of a Mafia turncoat, Tommaso Buscetta, Mr Falcone brought Sicilian mafiosi of all ranks to trial in 1986. The convictions of 350 gangsters were confirmed by Italy's Supreme Court last year. That confirmed Mr Falcone's working hypothesis: that the Cosa Nostra is a single, hierarchical organisation whose adepts have carved up Sicily--as well as overseas colonies in the United States and parts of mainland Italy--into family fiefs.
Mr Falcone's death shows this to be as true today as when Mr Buscetta first spilled the beans in 1984. Mr Falcone liked to describe himself as a servant of the state in terra infidelium, in the land of the unbelievers. When he flew into Palermo airport on May 23rd he well knew he was entering an area long usurped by the Mafia. His killers worked undisturbed. They packed a drainage tunnel under the motorway with explosives, and stood in a nearby olive grove to wait for the judge's car and its escort to flash past. The bomb was detonated with perfect precision. The police say at least ten people were involved in the attack. Not one was seen from nearby houses.
Often Mr Falcone had underlined the difference in the Italian government's response to the ""political"" terrorism of the Red Brigades, which was defeated by a combination of tough police measures and special legislation to protect the state's witnesses, and the hesitant attempts of successive governments to curb the Mafia. The outgoing interior minister, Vincenzo Scotti, admits that the Sicilian organisation is ""an enemy within"". Mafia turncoats have stated that in Palermo alone it controls close to 200,000 votes. In April Mr Scotti applied to have the municipality of Capaci, the village closest to the scene of Mr Falcone's assassination, brought under special state administration, because the local authorities were so infiltrated by the Mafia. Its council has now been suspended.
Yet Mr Falcone's experience and expertise were better exploited overseas than at home. His contribution, according to American investigators, was essential in dismantling a huge Italian-American heroin trafficking ring known as the ""pizza connection"", and in helping to convict a New York Mafia boss, John Gotti.
Embittered by his colleagues' envy, and alarmed by an earlier attempt on his life, Mr Falcone had retreated to a desk job in Rome in 1991. As director of penal affairs in the Ministry of Justice, he inspired a government proposal to create a central anti-Mafia prosecutor's office and strengthen hitherto fragmentary inquiries into organised crime. The proposal was approved by parliament last year, but has yet to be acted upon.
Mr Scalfaro's first task, after being sworn in this week, will be to pick a new prime minister. The general election on April 5th, which deprived the outgoing governing alliance of its majority but failed to throw up a clear alternative, complicates the job. The credibility of president and prime minister will stand or fall by their determination to lead the fight against organised crime. Should they fail, the damage to Italian democracy will be incalculable."

Mr Tapie, self-made multi-millionaire, boss of the leading Olympique de Marseille football club, and brilliant self-publicist, has many admirable qualities, but unimpeachable integrity is not usually counted among them.
This product of a tough, poor Parisian suburb, who rose to fame and fortune by buying up ailing and bankrupt companies, has always sailed close to the wind. The French stock-exchange regulatory body recently expressed concern about his holding company's accounting standards. His football club is under investigation for corruption and tax evasion. And now he faces charges of fraud arising from a dispute with a former business partner.
Mr Beregovoy knew most of this when he appointed Mr Tapie minister for urban affairs two months ago. But he needed someone dynamic to liven up an otherwise boringly familiar government. The Socialists had just taken a drubbing in regional elections, winning a pitiful 18% of the vote. Rejected by the greens, centrists and Communists, they desperately needed new allies in the run-up to a general election that is now less than a year away. Blunt-speaking Mr Tapie, who had set himself up as the left's champion against Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front, had voter-appeal.
Mr Tapie entered parliament three years ago as a non-aligned member of Mr Mitterrand's broad-based ""presidential majority"". ""I have confidence in him,"" Mr Beregovoy said in answer to the criticism that greeted the news of Mr Tapie's appointment to the government: ""I believe him to be honest. He is a winner.""
Neither the prime minister nor Mr Tapie expected that formal charges would result from the investigation into allegations by his former business partner, Georges Tranchant, that Mr Tapie had cheated him of his share of FFr13m ($2.4m). Mr Tranchant, a neo-Gaullist deputy, claimed that Mr Tapie sold the Nippon Audio Video System, a company jointly owned by himself and Mr Tapie, to Toshiba in 1985 for a reported price of FFr1.8m. It was several years before he discovered that Mr Tapie had been paid a further FFr13m by Toshiba, half of which Mr Tranchant claimed was rightly his. Mr Tapie says that the additional sum was for quite separate services rendered by him to Toshiba.
As rumours grew of impending criminal charges, Mr Tapie decided to counter-attack. In a newspaper interview on May 22nd, he claimed he was the victim of a ""political plot"", prompted by hatred and jealousy, and cast doubt on the competence and independence of the examining magistrate responsible for the case. Even if charges were brought, there was no question of his leaving the government, he insisted.
The next day he announced his resignation as minister, claiming he needed ""complete Freedom of speech in order to ensure [his] defence"". In fact, his hand had been forced. He had become too great a liability for the government. On May 27th he was charged with fraud. (French government ministers are prevented by law from being members of parliament and so have no immunity from prosecution.)
Had the wily Mr Beregovoy misread all the danger signals surrounding Mr Tapie? Or, as some are now suggesting, was the whole thing a plot to rid him of a dashing maverick, while at the same time enhancing his own squeaky-clean credentials? Whatever the explanation, the affair seems unlikely to dent the government's new-found popularity. The latest opinion polls show 54% of the public have confidence in Mr Beregovoy's abilities, compared with a lamentable 22% for Edith Cresson at the point of her departure two months ago.
Many Socialists are delighted to see the back of the ostentatious wheeler-dealer capitalist who, as Pierre Mauroy, a former party leader and an ex-prime minister, confessed, was never quite their cup of tea. But Mr Tapie will not disappear. People say he has presidential ambitions. And why not, if Ross Perot can make such waves in the United States?"
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224175352/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/32?accountid=14657,"Their struggle to reassert themselves among their once-domineering neighbours is reminding Poles of their unhappy past and exacerbating modern Poland's political troubles. Poles were not pleased that it took united Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, an unpardonably long time to recognise unequivocally Poland's western border. Then, earlier this month, Poland's president, Lech Walesa, was forced into some unseemly haggling when he visited Moscow to sign a new friendship treaty with Boris Yeltsin's Russia. Upon his return an angry Mr Walesa fired off yet another broadside at Poland's already shaky government and its prime minister, Jan Olszewski.
The Russian-Polish treaty commits the Russians to withdraw by November all but a few of the 40,000 ex-Soviet troops still stationed in Poland. That will be popular among Poles. Yet the government and parliament were angry at the secretive nature of the treaty--they were given almost no time to scrutinise it--as well as some of its more curious contents.
Many Poles, like Mr Walesa, believe it is high time to sort out their relations with the new Russia. But critics of the new treaty have a point or two. Though in the end Mr Yeltsin and Mr Walesa signed a joint declaration condemning totalitarianism, many Poles thought the treaty should have condemned more explicitly the sufferings of the Poles under Stalinism. More than 1.5m were deported to Soviet work camps at the beginning of the second world war; hundreds of thousands died. The massacre in 1940 of 15,000 Polish officers at Katyn has become a lasting symbol of Polish mistrust of the Russians, who until recently blamed the affair on the Nazis.
Disgruntled cabinet members also insist that Poland gave too much ground on the issue of troop withdrawal and compensation. For two years the Poles have insisted that they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars for five decades of having to house Soviet troops and for the environmental damage done by the Soviet army. The Russians have claimed, rather cheekily, that the Poles owe them for the cost of helping to feed and rebuild Poland after the war. In the end Mr Walesa went for a ""zero option"", with both sides dropping their claims.
The original version of the treaty would also have allowed the Russians to set up joint ventures in the facilities formerly used by Soviet troops. Mr Olszewski and others objected and the clause was eventually scrapped, but not before some last-minute angry words.
Mr Walesa described his talks with Mr Yeltsin as ""difficult discussions between two tough men"". But at least he has got a working agreement. That is more than can be said of his relations with Mr Olszewski, whom he has accused of trying to torpedo his diplomatic efforts. This week Mr Walesa asked the Sejm, Poland's parliament, to create a new cabinet. But, as usual, there was no obvious alternative to Mr Olszewski's crew."

Their chances of improving acquaintance even now may be limited. If the new man, Thomas Klestil, tries to catch up on all the foreign invitations that his predecessor, Kurt Waldheim, never received, he will not be spending much time at home.
It was partly his anonymity that helped the conservative Mr Klestil trounce his Social Democratic rival, Rudolf Streicher, a former transport minister, by 57% to 43% in the run-off on May 24th. For a lot of voters sick of the same old political faces, Mr Klestil's fresh one (grim though it looked on some of his dreadful election placards) came as a relief.
What Austrians were told of Mr Klestil's background--top career diplomat at the foreign office, former ambassador in Washington, economist--looked reassuring too. Now that Austria has applied to join the European Community, it more than ever wants a presentable substitute for Mr Waldheim, boycotted abroad because of a murky war record. Mr Klestil, with his international contacts and apparently unimpeachable record, seemed just the chap.
Although Austrians claim to choose their heads of state for their personalities rather than their parties, Mr Klestil's election means a boost for the political right. The Social Democrats, who have nearly always had ""their man"" as president, lost ground badly this time, not even getting their voters out in force in hitherto ""red Vienna"". The conservative Austrian People's Party, in uneasy grand-coalition government with the Social Democrats and long flagging in the polls, is cock-a-hoop that its initially much-criticised long-shot candidate made it after all.
Arguably just as pleased is Jorg Haider, a right-wing star dubbed ""Hitler's grandson"" by his foes. True, the candidate of Mr Haider's fast-growing Freedom Party got only 16% in the first round of the election on April 26th and dropped out of the running. But thanks to an indirect recommendation by Mr Haider, lots of Freedom Party voters switched their backing in the second round to Mr Klestil (somewhat to his embarrassment), helping him to victory.
A sign of things to come in government too? People's Party leaders say they plan no switch to a coalition with Mr Haider, notorious even outside Austria for his extremist language. But plenty of the rank and file reckon their party is being harmed more by the alliance with the Social Democrats than it would be by one with the Freedom Party, which includes liberals as well as right-wing tub-thumpers. Mr Klestil's election marks the end of the Waldheim era, but it may yet pave the way for a conservative government with Mr Haider as vice-chancellor."

But it makes other demands, too, because policing is such a big part of the job. The disclosure this week that one of the three most senior officers in the province had been moved on because he was unsuitable is a terse reminder of an awkward fact. Even the best soldiers can make poor policemen.
Controversy about the army's role is never far beneath the surface of Ulster politics. It was the nationalists who asked for the army's protection in the first place, back in 1969. But the troops have long since been seen as an occupying force by many nationalists, and not just the gunman of the IRA. Every row about rampaging soldiers thus casts a shadow over anything the politicians may be doing to seek a way out of the present violence. So it has proved again.
A new team of ministers at Stormont, where the Northern Ireland Office has its local base, has found itself struggling just to sustain the all-party talks on the province's future that were begun four weeks ago. The immediate difficulty is a disagreement between the Protestant Unionists and the nationalists of the SDLP about the timing of the Dublin government's proposed entry into the talks. But a deeper malaise is just as familiar: the local politicians are at loggerheads over their attitudes to devolution of power from Westminster.
At the heart of the devolution issue lies the question of who would be responsible for security. Unless some military and police powers were transferred to local politicians, devolution would be a shallow affair. But if change came, would nationalist politicians be prepared to take their share of responsibility for the security forces, including the operations of the army? (Only the IRA and its supporters argue for an early withdrawal of the army.) That would depend, say the nationalists, on what the army was doing and on how it was controlled. But the scope for serious embarrassment is obvious--and is underlined every time the army gets embroiled in a new clash with local people.
Senior police officers were predicting weeks ago that a serious clash was on its way. The 3rd Paratroop regiment arrived in East Tyrone at the beginning of April for a three-month tour of duty. The ""paras"" have an unhappy history in the province, and complaints about their behaviour towards the locals were not long coming.
At first they were part of a general surge of complaints in recent months throughout Northern Ireland about the worsening behaviour of soldiers on patrol and on duty at road-checks. Things became more serious when the Irish government started expressing its concern privately to British ministers. Then on May 12th the hostility between the paras and local people erupted into violence in Coalisland, hours after a young soldier had been badly injured by an IRA landmine near the town. Another disturbance followed in Coalisland on May 17th, and more trouble was reported on a Catholic estate in Londonderry this week.
The army's commanding officer in Northern Ireland, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilsey, has clearly been embarrassed by these events, and by the well-publicised departure of one of his senior officers. More to the point, they have raised again the issue of the army's accountability. In theory, Sir John reports to the chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and he has a weekly meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary to review security. In practice, though, he answers to the Ministry of Defence and has only a vaguely defined relationship with the ministers at Stormont. This appears to leave them with plenty of responsibility but little or no control.
Perhaps the politicians would like to see this changed. On the other hand, they have their own reasons for preferring to keep their distance from the army.
Not all the soldiers in Northern Ireland are taking turns at manning the road-checks. Some are involved in more specialised operations--which raise different and arguably even more serious questions of accountability. The army has understandably never been keen to discuss the covert activities of its best trained forces in the province--notably men of the Special Air Service (SAS) regiment and of a special surveillance unit known as 14 Intelligence Company. But the government has been content to control these special forces with a remarkably long leash.
OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND
More evidence of this appeared this week with the publication of a book called ""Big Boys' Rules: The Secret Struggle Against The IRA"". Its author, Mark Urban, is a former defence correspondent of the Independent--and a former soldier--who now works as a defence specialist for the BBC. After interviewing scores of those involved in the army's covert operations, he concludes that the killing of IRA men is tacitly endorsed by the authorities, provided the victims can be caught in an act of terrorism.
The security forces call this ""a clean kill"". It requires top-grade intelligence, to set up the opportunity for an ambush, and tough soldiering. When successful, though, the obvious identity of the victims as Republican gunmen practically guarantees a positive reaction from the media. Confident on this score, the politicians appear to have given the SAS and 14 Company enough room, where they need it, to mislead both the rest of the security forces and the courts over the exact circumstances of any killings.
The SAS has killed at least 37 gunmen since setting up in Ulster as a local force in 1976. It worries nationalist politicians that all but one of these men have been Catholic Republicans; the army, they say, sees the conflict in Northern Ireland purely in terms of Republicanism against the forces of the Crown--which understates the problem of Protestant loyalist violence. What concerns many observers, whatever their political alignment, is that covert operations can be carried out with so little accountability. Soldiers do not have to attend court inquests; and their need to protect intelligence sources is generally respected, with few questions asked.
The same privileges have not been extended to the police. Indeed, the present role of the SAS to some extent reflects a decision in the early 1980s--following the notorious ""shoot-to kill"" incidents of 1982--that such measures could not be handled by the RUC. Its officers cannot evade the attentions of the media as successfully as anonymous soldiers can.
It is precisely because of the police's more restrained approach that so many outside the province, not least the government in Dublin, go on pressing for the RUC to be given more control over the army in all policing matters. The controversy over the recent behaviour of the paras led RUC officers to issue an ultimatum on the need for immediate command changes. Perhaps it has also alerted Stormont to the need for a longer-term review of the army's role."

In the first four months of this year the current-account deficit was running at an annual rate of almost L10 billion, up from L4.4 billion last year, mainly because of higher imports. The Jeremiahs fret that, as the economy strengthens and imports swell, so the external deficit will grow.
The markets are still inclined to take a more optimistic view: the pound actually rose slightly when this week's figures were published. The City sees the growing deficit as a sign that economic recovery has at last begun. And there maybe another reason, too, for not getting too despondent about the deficit: it makes a poor guide to Britain's external finances.
A crucial flaw is the way that the financial returns on different types of overseas assets are treated. Since Britain has sizeable net foreign assets, this counts. Though the assets have fallen considerably from their peak in the mid-1980s, official figures suggest they were still almost L30 billion ($58 billion) at the end of 1990. This figure includes a net overseas portfolio of equities and bonds, and direct investments that together totalled L81 billion (and a counterbalancing net foreign bank debt of L54 billion).
The problem lies in the way that returns on the portfolio and direct investments are included in the current account--or rather, not included. The interest earned on money in foreign bank deposits is included (minus the even larger interest paid by Britons to foreigners). Likewise the dividends from equities and the profits from net overseas direct investments count as current-account receipts. These sums, though, comprise only a small part of the total return on equities and direct investments. The capital gains that make up the rest are left out, arid treated as a capital-account item.
The conventional current-account balance thus systematically understates the true strength of Britain's international financial position. After all, capital gains on its international portfolio make Britain richer in the long term, in just the same way as interest income.
If all Britain's net foreign assets were placed in bank deposits, its recorded investment income would be larger and the current-account deficit would be that much smaller. By investing in foreign equities rather than bank deposits, though; British investors are reacting rationally to the fact that equities have historically yielded a much higher (if more volatile) total return than bank deposits.
So how large have been the capital gains on Britons' holdings of overseas equities and direct investment? Drawing on an earlier study by Cliff Pratten, an economist at Cambridge University, Tim Congdon of Gerrard & National, a City firm, estimates that the gains on these holdings were of the order of L80 billion in the decade to 1989--more than enough to offset a cumulative current-account deficit over that period of L17 billion.
In 1990 falling share prices and a weaker dollar resulted in a net capital loss on British overseas assets of about L42 billion, but much of that has since been recovered as share prices have rebounded. Mr Congdon reckons that Britain's total net overseas assets, if measured correctly (ie, valuing direct investments at market value), might now amount to between L80 billion and L100 billion--rather more than the L60 billion shown in most estimates that are based on book value.
The higher valuation might be expected to yield a total annual return (ie, combining net capital gains with income) of between L10 billion and L14 billion a year. Those who are seriously anxious about a balance-of-payments constraint on future growth should compare that with the projected current-account deficit of about L10 billion for 1992."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224147434/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/36?accountid=14657,"Because Westminster MPs represent constituencies that were drawn up according to where people lived 16 years ago, and because thousands of people have since moved, some parliamentary seats in England contain nearly 2-1/2 times more voters than others. Members of the Boundary Commission are now busy poring over maps, trying to work out how to carve up the country into constituencies of similar size. Since almost all these changes will benefit the Conservative Party, the government is planning shortly to introduce a parliamentary bill to speed up the process--just in time to apply the new map at the next general election.
Each English parliamentary seat should ideally contain 69,281 voters, which is the 1991 English average. (The fortunate Scots have far fewer voters in their constituencies--54,369 on average--because by law the number of seats in Scotland cannot fall below 71; if the English average were applied there, Scotland would have only 57 MPs.) Currently there is a fairly lumpy pattern: it ensures, for example, just 46,855 voters in the seat of Newham North West, in London's East End, while 92,913 voters in the lush pastures of rural Huntingdon all share one MP--John Major.
The commission calculates each county's new ""theoretical entitlement"" by dividing its current electorate (as of 1991), by 69,281 (the average size of an English seat), and rounding it up or down so as to minimise the deviation from the average constituency size. The consequent distribution of the new seats has been putting a spring in the step of Tory ministers ever since the election.
Almost all the additions will be in Tory areas (see table).(Table omitted) These are the rather prosperous bits of England like Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire that, since the mid-1980s, have been filling up fast with people fleeing the big cities. Go to any middling-sized town, from York to Yeovil, and the outward creep of today's version of post-war semi-detached suburbia is striking: neatly arranged cul-de-sacs of new double-lazed houses, complete with a fenced garden and a patio at the back. Analysis of the Boundary Commission's work so far by Peter Bromhead, a professor of politics at Bristol University, shows that these towns have together absorbed enough people since 1976 to deserve a minimum of 21 extra seats.
By contrast, and to the opposition's consternation, the places that have been emptying since 1976 are the traditional heartlands of Labour support--Manchester, Liverpool, the West Midlands and London. Of the 213 metropolitan seats currently in areas due to lose a seat, 128 are now Labour-held.
So far the Boundary Commission has proposed changes for 20 counties; working east from Cornwall, it has got as far as Lincolnshire. Many of these changes are relatively simple: the electorates have grown big enough clearly to merit an extra MP. But the next stage is trickier. The statutory rules state that changes should not lead to an increase in the total number of seats at Westminster. But because of rounding, the total number of losers and winners will not match exactly. So the commission has to deprive some counties of extra seats even where, theoretically, they deserve them. The commission has decided that Avon, for example, will not gain the extra seat to which it is entitled. Each of its judgments will be open to a public inquiry, which must weigh up every objection to the proposed new map. (The first such inquiry, into the proposals for Devon, will open on June 8th.)
In London the map looks even messier. This time the rules state that constituency boundaries should not cross borough lines. But as a result, replacing two MPs with One in some shrinking constituencies would leave the survivor with too many electors. Some ague that it would make more sense to press for a change to the rules, and give off the outer bits of the relevant boroughs to their neighbours. The edges of Kensington & Chelsea, to take one obvious candidate for the two-MPs-into-one treatment, could be parcelled off to neighbouring Brent East or Hammersmith--though this would no doubt incense the Tory-voting residents in bits of outer Kensington, who would then find themselves with a Labour MP.
Not all the London losses will be Labour's, but the net result spells disaster for the party. The Tories stand to gain up to 20 new seats; so even if no other seats changed hands at the next general election, the Tory majority would jump by 40, delivering a handsome 61-seat advantage at Westminster.
Hence the enthusiasm of Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, for introducing as soon as possible a Boundary Commission bill, as outlined in the Queen's Speech, to speed up the commission's work. Otherwise the commission is not obliged to ink out the final version of the new map until 1993 at the earliest, and could leave it as late as 1998. If the new bill is rushed through the Commons before the summer recess, the extra Tory seats could be safely on the statute books in time for a 1996 general election.
Labour might be able to stall the changes, as it did for six months during the previous review. The party could claim that, since the allocation is being made according to the electoral register of 1991, and since that was short of some 700,000 voters largely because of poll-tax dodgers, some of the inner-city boroughs that are due to lose seats should be reconsidered.
But any alterations are likely to be tinkering at the margin. In the end the Boundary Commission's changes will simply drive home how weak the geographical base of Labour's electoral support has become. Whoever is elected as the new Labour leader will have added reason to push the party's electoral appeal out from the cities towards those double-glazed cul-de-sacs."

As the sun goes down, thousands of hip youngsters, clad in regulation black sportswear, flock from miles around to pack themselves on to the sweaty dance floor and rave till dawn.
""Rave"" music is propelling the nation's young into a frenzy of all-night, high-energy dancing on a scale not seen since Punk was at its height. And much of it is being dreamed up in bedrooms and pressed on to vinyl by youngsters with little more than a home computer--prompting a good deal of head-scratching among the music industry's middle-aged executives.
Cheap technology has caused this small revolution. For around L2,000 ($3,500), a would-be rave artist can buy enough gadgetry to produce in his own home the sort of electronic noises that previously cost a small fortune in a recording studio. The biggest innovation is an electronic marvel about the size of an old-fashioned record-player, called a sampler. With it, you can record snatches of other people's music digitally (ie, with a sound quality that matches the original) and then mix them up and call the product your own. No youngster fancying his future as a composer need be deterred by an ignorance of music theory, lack of skills or advanced tone deafness.
The latter, especially, might even be an advantage. To the uneducated ear, rave music is a bone-jangling din, hurtling along at up to 200 beats a minute. Connoisseurs stress the subtle nuances: Detroit ""techno"" is more metallic, British hardcore makes some concession to melody. ""It's not the kind of music you want to play your mother,"" admits Dave Piccioni of Black Market Records, one of Soho's hippest dance-music stores, ""but the lyrics are not offensive."" Recent releases include titles like ""Cooking Up Yah Brain"".
Rave has exploded too fast for anybody to be able to count the number of independent record labels; it is an easy business to operate illicitly, out of the taxman's sight. But the full rave experience involves, often with the aid of hallucinogens, dancing your way into a state of hypnotic oblivion known in the trade as ""getting cabbaged"". So one measure of its popularity is the growth in dance-music sales. According to Gallup, which compiles the network charts, dance music jumped from 23% of all singles sold in 1986 to 33% in 1990; some reckon it could soon be heading for 40% of the total.
In many ways, rave looks like another of those all-conquering crazes that keep the music industry happy. For the big record companies, though, there are snag. They thrive on picking up a new sound from the street and turning it into a packaged product, preferably with a photogenic vocalist to splash across the record covers. But dance music is faceless. Rave emerged not from artists performing in front of audiences, but from clubs where what counts is the beat and the sweat, not the glossiness of the performing artist.
Nor can the big companies easily shift the production of dance music in their favourite direction: away from vinyl singles and over to money-spinning compact discs. Rave is all about 12-inch vinyl. When the dance tracks are played in the clubs, they need to be speeded up, slowed down, scratched or spun--all tricks of the humble vinyl disc, that the mighty CD cannot perform. Disc jockeys are not called thing like Groove Rider or Loft Groover for nothing. Besides, most of the youngsters who buy dance records would consider CDs the ultimate in middle-aged naffness.
Dance music thrives on the word on the street, a notoriously fickle thing. Tickets for the trendiest raves are still publicised with the minimum of commercial hype--via leaflets handed out in dance-music stores (""No hippies or trainers""), or on pirate-radio stations like Chillin' FM. But the street in this case is a long one: record-store buyers and DJs get back and forth from America and the Continent with suitcases full of new tracks. For rave seems to obey no cultural rules: some of the hippest stuff around comes from, yes, Belgium and Essex.
Fashions within the genre change with lightning speed. A new track can be mixed in a matter of hours, which means a distinctive sound can become popular at raves one week and storm into the charts the next. Small independent labels are better equipped than the big companies to respond to this pace, and have done so: recent hits at number one and two in the charts, for instance, were produced by a couple of commercial minnows, Network and XL.
Some independents take the ephemeral quality of rave to a logical conclusion, producing ""white labels"" that are unmarked even by the name of the recording artist (if that is not a misnomer). Ardent clubbers have been seen queuing up at dance-music stores and tapping out rhythms on the counters. How else do you order a tuneless record without a name?"

So far, the new session has seemed at a tangent to national life. The opposition is still in therapy; the government feels free, even smug. Can it be long before the alert citizen, faced with yet another report about prime minister's questions, or the latest twist in the battle to be Labour's deputy leader, spots what is (or rather isn't) going on--and switches off?
In common parlance, the words Westminster and politics have become almost interchangeable in Britain. It is therefore right to ask whether this elision--and this narrowing of the political world--has started to obscure how the British system works. What may be needed is a wider, less exclusive notion of politics.
Here is a cheeky comparison. Greenpeace, an international environmental lobby, has 411,000 British supporters in 210 local groups; it had an income of around L8m ($14.5m) last year; and it influences government thinking. The Labour Party has only 254,000 paid-up individual members. In 1990, the last year for which figures are available, its income was L6m. It has next to no influence on government. In the real world, which organisation cuts more ice?
Greenpeace, of course, has no MPs or local councillors; nor does it seek, even in the long term, to rule. Pushed too far, the comparison is a false one. But environmental groups command attention in Whitehall in a way that Labour, and the Liberal Democrats, cannot. They and other pressure groups are already taken seriously by policy-makers. With the collapse of the Labour-Liberal challenge to John Major's project for a ""nation at ease with itself"", is an era of pressure-politics on the way? If it is, political journalists will have to learn about a new and unfamiliar politics, with its own leaders, rituals and processes.
Take Greenpeace again. Although it has 80 full-time London staff, many of them researchers, it has been more of an issue-raiser than a lobbyist. The much smaller (46,000-strong) Council for the Protection of Rural England, which is currently campaigning for water-metering as a response to southern drought, matters more in Whitehall. But the public support for Greenpeace, and its skills as a troublemaker for officialdom, mean that it is an essential part of the process. The Department of Health's current campaign of advice about ozone depletion and skin cancer was partly Greenpeace-inspired. So was the environment department's 1989 reversal of policy on the importing of toxic waste. There are many other examples, from company-car taxation to phase-out dates for ozone-destroying materials, where the lobbyists have scored.
Exactly how important one or another group has been is hard to assess accurately. This is particularly so because ministers (for some obscure reason) think they seem more dignified if they pretend not to have been influenced in the first place. So Westminster's macho culture obscures how things really happen. But when the big pressure groups are taken tether, their role in bringing ideas onto the political agenda is clearly significant.
Who did ministers listen to hardest over the issue of water quality for consumers--Friends of the Earth, with its 230,000 supporters, or the Commons? No contest. The same is true beyond the world of green politics. Who does the Treasury take seriously when it comes to tax? The Institute of Directors, with its arguments about expenditure taxes, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has done recent work on mortgage-tax relief, and the Child Poverty Action Group are all far more influential than backbench MPs.
Ideas such as water-metering and the abolition of income tax may take a long time to reach the ministerial agenda. But the good idea will elbow its way there sooner or later. Charter 88, a constitutional-reform movement, has brought debate about Britain's ruling institutions to a new level, and a new audience (including many Tories). The Citizen's Charter did not appear magically over the prime minister's pillow one night; it was campaigned for by the National Consumer Council throughout the 1980s.
Yet short-termism and the parliamentary habit have disguised the influence of such groups. Supported, tacitly or actively, by millions of people, they mostly ignore parliament and work directly on civil servants and ministers. And, in these days when the emergence of the British single-party state is seriously discussed, they will surely become more important. They are not only wheeze-banks; for ministers, they serve as a warning system of serious discontent. Clever ministers listen--and sometimes (as recently over government secrecy) act.
But the pressure-group phenomenon should not be seen only through the prism of Whitehall. It provides a useful corrective to the idea that the British are apathetic and sceptical about politics. They may turn out to be merely apathetic about the Westminster method. Much of this ""lower politics"" is local, such as the myriad of planning and transport action groups. But plenty of Britons are conscience-driven, as they always have been.
The same sorts of people who, in Victorian times, campaigned against child labour and slavery, or 60 years ago, agonised about the Abyssinian crisis and the Spanish civil war, are today bundling up books for Russia or are among the 30,000 volunteers who run Oxfam shops. Britain is awash with amateur politicians. The only thing is, they are not, many of them, in the political parties.
Laziness and sheer habit may mean that this mass of activity stays outside the national conversation about politics. Westminster is easy to write about. There are hundreds of people milling about wanting nothing more than to be written about; and hundreds of other people whose only function is to write about them. Oh yes, and they drink in the same bars. But the assumption that extra-parliamentary politics is automatically less important, even less real, than most of what happens at Westminster, is starting to look embarrassingly threadbare.
Is the battle for the Labour deputy leadership more real than the campaign to cut ozone-depleting gases? Was the latest mutual mockery in the chamber more significant than the new thinking on constitutional reform from Charter 88? Was it, somehow, more ""political""? Bagehot, in a mood of self-criticism, will try to do better in future."

The factory, which is due to go into production by 1994, will be the first American semiconductor plant in China. It will also make pagers, mobile telephones and electronic equipment for cars. Many companies would consider the project risky. Motorola had to abort plans for an even bigger investment in China after Tiananmen Square. Trying to match global quality and productivity standards in China will not be easy. But Motorola is accustomed to being the pioneer in Asia, ever willing to take risks. The reason is simple: Asia is where markets for the company's products will grow fastest for years to come.
Within a decade, sales in Asia could be Motorola's biggest source of revenue, reckons Rick Younts, who runs most of the company's international businesses from its headquarters near Chicago. He expects Motorola's Asian sales, including those in Japan, to grow two or three times faster over the next decade than its sales in Europe or America. Last year Motorola had sales of $11.3 billion; of that, 49% was outside the United States. Europe had the biggest overseas share, probably around a quarter of total sales (the company itself does not give a breakdown). Asia, including the 10% of sales made in Japan, accounted for 21%.
About 85% of Motorola's revenues come from mobile communications (two-way radios, pagers and cellular telephones) and semiconductors (mainly microprocessors, for personal computers and the like, and microcontrollers, for cars and consumer electronics). These markets are growing far faster in Asia than in Europe or North America. In the case of communications equipment, the growth is from a small base, but in semiconductors Asia already accounts for half the world market.
Motorola began dabbling in Asia in the 1960s, when it set up sales agencies in Japan and Hong Kong. The company now has one marketing headquarters, three country headquarters, seven manufacturing plants and 11 sales offices scattered through ten Asian countries, including Australia. But Japan and Hong Kong remain the keys to Motorola's Asian business.
In 1982 Motorola decided to become a serious competitor in Japan. One reason, says Isamu Kuru, the president of Motorola's Japanese subsidiary, was simply the size of the Japanese market; by his reckoning, Japan accounts for a quarter to a third of worldwide demand for semiconductors. And, like many other western companies over the past decade, Motorola concluded that it had to challenge its Japanese competitors in their home market if it wanted to match their skills and technology everywhere else.
It was rough going at first. In the mid-1980s Motorola complained loudly about market barriers in Japan; the American government argued for years to gain entry for Motorola's cellular telephones. Today Motorola plays down these matters. Mr Younts says ""cultural and hidden barriers"" are still in place, but Motorola has become pretty good at getting around them.
The turning-point came in 1987 when Motorola formed an alliance with Toshiba. The two companies set up a joint chip-making venture and Toshiba provided Motorola with marketing help (not to mention Mr Kuru, who joined Motorola to run its Japanese business in 1990 after 28 years with Toshiba). Mr Kuru says that Motorola is looking for more Japanese partners because these are essential for success in the political game of winning government approvals and radio frequencies for mobile communications.
Motorola's managers in Hong Kong face more varied difficulties. In 1990 Motorola opened a large chip-design and manufacturing centre in northern Hong Kong, a few miles from the Chinese border. Tam Chung Ding, who directs Motorola's Asian chip operations from there, points out that competition in the Asian market is already fierce: Japanese chip companies think of East Asia as their back garden, other American firms are also expanding there and South Korean and Taiwanese companies have captured 18% of Asian sales.
THE HEART OF THE STRATEGY
Mr Tam identifies three things as essential for any strategy in Asia's chip market. The first is to form alliances with other companies. The chip business is so capital-intensive--a new chip factory can easily cost $1 billion--that almost nobody can afford to go it alone. Besides, customers tend towant a full range of chips from any supplier. Motorola's link with Toshiba has been invaluable. The American firm is strongest in microprocessors and custom-designed chips; Toshiba is better known as a supplier of memory chips. Motorola is now exploring links with two Korean chipmakers, Lucky Goldstar and Samsung.
Second, personal connections matter more in Asia than elsewhere. Engineering students with whom Mr Tam studied 15 years ago now run chip divisions of Korean companies; this makes it easier for him to sell to these companies or negotiate collaborative deals with them.
Third, Asian operations need to be grown slowly and staffed with locals from the beginning. This demonstrates the firm's commitment to the local market and helps to ensure that it has access to the right skills. Loyalty matters a great deal in most Asian societies.
Motorola is intrigued by the free-market reforms under way in India, and in April the company opened a software-engineering centre there. But it believes China offers the greatest long-term potential. The economy of greater southern China--including Hong Kong, Taiwan and a few provinces in China itself--had a GDP of $275 billion in 1990. Mr Tam argues that Motorola's operations in both Singapore and Hong Kong, with their links to their ethnic Chinese businessmen, will serve as good launching-pads for the penetration of China's burgeoning market.
Managing diverse operations in so many countries is complicated. Motorola's head office is run by a triumvirate: George Fisher, chairman and chief executive; Gary Tooker, president and chief operating officer; and Christopher Galvin, Mr Tooker's assistant (and, not incidentally, the son of Robert Galvin, who was chairman for decades and is still chairman of the executive board). The company's businesses are organised both by product and by region.
In Asia's three biggest markets--Japan, China and India--Motorola's businesses have their own bosses and choose and market their own products. Elsewhere in Asia subsidiaries report to bosses back in America.
Ten years ago Motorola tried to organise its operations solely by geography. But it found that leaving every region to its own devices made no sense, because investment and production decisions needed to be made globally. Now, says Mr Tam, finance and production are directed from the centre. Recruitment, marketing and operations are controlled locally. Mr Tam runs the Hong Kong chip factory as he thinks best, but a third of its output is exported to America for sale by Motorola's sales force there, and 20% to Europe.
In the case of chips, there are three product lines and three geographic divisions. The performance of the geographic divisions is judged by sales, profit and market share; the performance of each factory by its costs, quality and timeliness of production. Twice a year, six representatives--three from the product groups and three from the region--meet to set a plan for the next six months. It sounds messy, but Motorola has found that it works better than the alternatives: dictation from the centre, in Japanese style; or purely geographic control."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224167532/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/40?accountid=14657,"On May 26th Frans Andriessen, the European Community's trade commissioner, arrived in Washington hoping for some reward for the EC's hard-won reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), its system of farm subsidies. A clutch of notables had been lined up to meet him, including Carla Hills, America's trade representative and James Baker, the secretary of state. Would his visit, and the EC's reform of the CAP, suffice to breathe enough life back into the Uruguay round of global trade talks to make a deal possible before the summit of G7 leaders in early July?
The fate of the round has become an intensely political question. That makes it unpredictable: if America's government decides it wants a deal, the breakthrough could come at a moment's notice. As we went to press, however, the will appeared to be lacking. American officials said they were unimpressed with the changes to the CAP. Indeed, they seemed willing to let a long-running dispute on the obscure subject of oilseed subsidies (see box) erupt into a shouting match.(Box omitted) Even as Mr Andriessen was arriving in Washington, Mrs Hills was contemplating slapping the biggest trade sanctions in American history on a range of EC expos as result of this argument.
When EC farm ministers at last agreed on May 21st to change the CAP, they hoped they had conceded enough to unblock the world trade talks. Besides cutting cereal prices sharply, the changes would shift assistance away from price supports to direct subsidies, which distort trade less. Under the deal, farmers will still be paid by governments to produce grain, but only if they take 15% of their land out of production. By the EC's standards, the plan is revolutionary.
Happily the reform met some of the requirements of a proposal passed round last winter by GATT's director-general, Arthur Dunkel--a plan that the Americans have since waved around as their bible. However, as well as asking for cuts of 20% in the value of the CAP's domestic production subsidies, Mr Dunkel called for cuts of 24% in the volume of subsidised exports.
It is this last target that most exercises the Americans. Unfortunately, the CAP reform will not get close to meeting it, though the figure, as the Americans love to point out, was first suggested by EC negotiators.
For all the reform's inadequacy, American officials knew that Mr Andriessen was most unlikely to win even bigger cuts back in Brussels. But the Americans seemed ready to shrug this off as none of their business. ""It's not a question of our demanding change in the CAP,"" said one American negotiator, ""it's a question of whether they can undertake international obligations.""
Meanwhile, Mrs Hills is set any day to publish a list of European products which may have sanctions slapped on them as a result of the oilseeds argument. For the moment, two lists exist; how they will be merged remains unclear. Especially prominent on one of them, covering $2 billion of farm goods, are French products such as wine, cheese and sausage. The other list covers $500m of industrial goods. Once a merged list is published, according to section 301 of America's trade law, the government has 30 days to gather comments on it and then cut it in half, before imposing sanctions, most likely tariffs. The threat of such action would ""roil the atmosphere"", admitted one American negotiator.
If Mr Andriessen went to Washington believing that the Americans were pragmatists, ready to bank an acceptable deal on farming, he was ambling against long odds. Anger about the EC's past intransigence on farm trade remains strong. And the American public's limited interest in trade issues in an election year is centred on Japan, or on attempts to forge a free-trade agreement with Mexico. The changes to the CAP agreed in Brussels were hailed across Europe as a ""historic breakthrough""; America's news media barely noticed them."

SIR--You accept too credulously the arguments of those who criticise economic approaches to the environment. Certainly, the idea of sustainable development has drawn attention to environmental problems that were ignored for too long. But there is no intellectually legitimate case for abandoning accepted techniques of cost-benefit analysis in evaluating environmental investments, either by using abnormally low discount rates or, worse yet, by invoking special criteria regarding sustainability.
The argument that a moral obligation to future generations demands special treatment of environmental investments is fatuous. We can help our descendants as much by improving infrastructure as by preserving rain forests, as much by educating children as by leaving oil in the ground, as much by enlarging our scientific knowledge as by reducing carbon dioxide in the air. However much, or little, current generations wish to weigh the interests of future generations, there is every reason to undertake investments that yield the highest returns.
That means holding each investment, environmental and non-environmental, to a test of opportunity cost. Each project must have a higher return (taking account of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits) than alternative uses of the funds. Standard public non-environmental investments like sewage-treatment facilities, education programmes, or World Bank transport projects have returns of more than 10%. Most private investors apply even higher ""hurdle rates"" in evaluating investments, generally 15% or more, because higher-return alternatives are available.
Once costs and benefits are properly measured, it cannot be in posterity's interest for us to undertake investments that yield less than the best return. At the long-term horizons that figure in the environmental debate, this really matters. A dollar invested at 10% will be worth six times as much a century from now as a dollar invested at 8% (see table). (Table omitted)
The premise that our first priority should be to do more for our descendants is, anyway, debatable. Surely it is ethically relevant that our grandchildren will in all likelihood be much better off than we are. While nobody can accurately predict long-term growth rates, remember that standards of living are three times higher than 60 years ago in the United States, seven times higher in Germany and almost ten times higher in Japan. Should my American grandparents have reduced their standard of living, when life was considerably more nasty, brutish and short than now, to leave raw materials in the ground for my benefit?
To think so implies an odd morality. What is the better course for rich countries: to put more aside for a posterity that will be far richer than we are, or to do more to help the world's poor now? I, for one, feel the tug of the billion people who subsist on less than $1 a day in 1992 more acutely than the tug of future generations.
Some environmentalists talk about stewardship. They say we have an obligation to pass on to our children what has been passed on to us. Of course, we all wish our children to be better off than we are. But any investment that would make the difference between rising and falling living standards would pass a cost-benefit test at standard discount rates.
The reason why some investments favoured by environmentalists fail such a test is that their likely effect on living standards is not so great. Take the most serious global problem--climate changes from greenhouse gases. In the worst-case scenario of the most pessimistic estimates yet prepared (those of William Cline of the Institute for International Economics), global warming reduces growth over the next two centuries by less than 01% a year. More should be done: dealing with global warming would not halt economic growth either. But raising the spectre of our impoverished grandchildren if we fail to address global environmental problems is demagoguery.
Some suggest that whatever happens to an economy's productive potential, it is always wrong to damage any part of its natural patrimony irreversibly. But what is irreversible damage? Clearly, cutting down some trees and burning some scarce natural gas is all right, because sufficiently close substitutes are available. At the other extreme, no sane person would favour causing the extinction of hundreds of species to build a dam, if other poverty reducing strategies were available. In every case, the question returns to trade-offs between costs and benefits. Chanting the mantra of sustainability is not enough.
In applying the standard cost-benefit paradigm to the environment, however, two issues do come up.
First, some advocate treating environmental investments differently, on the grounds that they are alternatives to consumption, not to other investments. This partly depends on how additional environmental spending is financed. But that is essentially a political judgment. Honest analysts should not endorse projects if proposals yielding higher returns are available. And given the extremely high interest rates at which most of the world's consumers are willing to borrow, consumption should not in any case be lightly sacrificed.
Second, it is argued that environmental damage is both uncertain and possibly irreversible. The right way to allow for the unusual riskiness of environmental decisions is to estimate the benefits of environmental investment generously, making special allowance for the value of options that they preserve. However plausible it may seem to reduce the discount rate to allow for risk, this reflects an elementary fallacy. To apply a specially low discount rate merely increases the weight attached to risks in the distant future as compared with risks in the near future-which makes no sense.
Environmentalists who point to the damage done by dams, power plants and roads evaluated according to standard economic criteria have a point. The answer does not lie in blanket sustainability criteria, or in applying special discount rates, but in properly incorporating environmental costs into the appraisal of projects. The grim fact is that no careful analysis was done of many of the projects which environmentalists condemn. The world's problem is not too much cost-benefit analysis, but too little that is done well. Plenty of environmental improvements can pass rigorous cost-benefit tests. There is no need to cook the books."

He hopes that it will move computing from the desktop to the coat pocket. Called Newton, the new machine promises to be notepad, diary, fax machine, and data terminal all in one battery-powered, video-cassette-sized package. Mr Sculley's first challenge is simply to deliver what he has promised--which, if all goes to plan, he will do in the early months of 1993. Then all he has to do is keep on top of what should rapidly become one of the world's most competitive and fast-changing markets.
On paper at least, Newton sounds great. Powered by new, fast, battery-saving microprocessors from Acorn RISC Machines, a British company, Newton should be a step ahead of the competition in four key areas:
* Handwriting recognition. Newton will recognise carefully printed text in more or less any size or style. It will also store sketches and cursive handwriting as digital images.
* Intelligent assistance. Newton will try to anticipate frequently repeated tasks. So if you send a lot of memos to your boss, Ralph, simply writing ""send memo to Ralph"" should be enough to prompt Newton to work out which of the Ralphs in its address book you mean, extract his electronic-mail address and (after checking to make sure that this really is the Ralph you want) send him your most recently written note.
* Communications. Some Newton machines will have the ability to plug into computer networks. Others will be able to receive radio signals.
* Information access. Newton's software is designed to make it easy to retrieve any snippet of information, no matter when or how you put it into the computer. So you can easily scan every stored reference to the man you are lunching with on Monday.
Easier said, however, than done. In all of these technologies, the difference between success and failure lies more in the implementation than in the vision. At the launch of the Macintosh personal computer in 1984, Apple seemed so dazzled by the brilliance of its innovations that it was slow to remedy defects that annoyed users of the new machine.
Mr Sculley says he has learnt from the mistakes of the Macintosh. Just as well. If Apple stumbles, it may not get a second chance in this market. By the time Newton reaches the stores, a variety of competitors should have their own, similar machines ready for launch--including Sharp, which has helped Apple to develop Newton's hardware.
In the end, the technology that wins the competition for coat-pocket computers will simply be that which is most useful. That is why Apple is busily trying to sign up other companies to complement Newton's technology with their own.
So far it has recruited, among others, SkyTel, which runs a satellite network capable of delivering e-mail or stock quotes to a Newton almost anywhere in the developed world. Another important ally is Random House, which publishes guidebooks and other sorts of reference works that people might want to browse through with their Newtons."

Sony's Mini Disc, long publicised but shown to the public for the first time only on May 26th, is both an impressive feat of engineering and an enormous gamble. It is to be marketed as a recordable version of today's compact discs (CDs)--and one that, like a tape cassette, does not skip beats when jolted in the pocket or on the dashboard of a car. As such, Sony is out to position the Mini Disc as a direct rival to the tape-based Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) announced recently by Matsushita and Philips. But it is also trying to sell the handy little Mini Disc machines as strictly for use on the move, while the bulkier CD player remains at home. The thinking behind this strategy is to stimulate new sales without killing demand for CDs and CD players; Sony is a big supplier of both.
Some might praise Sony's ageing bosses, chairman Akio Morita, 71, and president Norio Ohga, 62, for yet another bold stroke. Under their direction Sony has sometimes thrived by taking the electronics industry, and consumers, by surprise. But it has also spent a fortune in Hollywood which may take years to earn a decent return, if it ever does. And the company's marketing strategy for the Mini Disc looks worse than merely risky--it looks nonsensical. Perhaps Sony now needs somebody more prudent, or more calculating, at the top, though no successor to either Mr Morita or Mr Ohga is anywhere in sight.
Consumers are already dazed by the proliferation of new formats and products offered by the electronics industry. Sony's plans for the Mini Disc threaten to so bewilder customers that they could stop spending money on such gadgets entirely.
To ensure the success of the new format, the company believes that it must make plenty of prerecorded music titles available quickly. Some 500 Mini Disc albums mostly pop music and jazz--are scheduled to go on sale on November 1st in Japan, when the new machines reach the stores. Yet flooding the market with prerecorded discs will only reinforce the Mini Disc's image as strictly a playback medium--in short, a direct replacement for the CD.
The same is true for Sony's emphasis on the Mini Disc's portability. The machines that Sony, and 21 other manufacturers which have licensed the technology from it, will offer initially will be Walkman-like players, car stereos and portable ""boomboxes"". Unfortunately, the market for portable hi-fi has proved to be almost exclusively for playback-only equipment. Most consumers make their recording at home.
If Sony produces a Mini Disc machine for the home, where its recording facilities are more likely to be used, the company will be asking consumers to scrap their new and pricey CD players along with their collections of CDs. Many consumers will not be amused. Most could find the DCC format offered by Matsushita and Philips both easier to understand and a better buy. DCC machines will play conventional tapes, though not with the same pristine sound they will produce when new digital tapes are used. DCC machines will be marketed simply as a better type of cassette player, and will not require consumers to junk any of their existing music collections or abandon their new CD players.
One reason Sony is pushing its Mini Disc so hard may be that the company badly needs a new money-spinner. Its current problems have less to do with the worldwide slump, stiffer competition, the strengthening yen and the prolonged depression in Tokyo's stockmarket (all cited by the company's managers) than with its own over-reliance on the slow-growing market for video equipment and its forays beyond consumer electronics.
Sony's music business, which it bought for $2 billion in 1988 from CBS, suffered a 7% decline in sales last year. Sony's movie business, acquired when it bought Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion in 1989, is probably still failing to cover the cash lavished on it. Movie revenues did grow by 28% last year, thanks to box-office hits ""Terminator 2"" and ""Hook"". But the movie industry is notoriously fickle. This year, or next, Sony, like any movie studio, could have more flops than hits. For the longer term, Sony's rationale for buying CBs Records and Columbia was to reap gains from the ""synergy"" between entertainment software (records or movies) and electronic hardware. No such gains are yet visible."

On June 4th the group that lobbies for America's computer-chip industry meets its Japanese counterpart in Tokyo. It will claim that the agreement struck between the American and Japanese governments last June has not been honoured. Then, as it has before, it will ask the administration to impose punitive trade sanctions. The Japanese businessmen deny the charge.
The part of last year's deal that is in dispute is a clause in which Japan promises to try its hardest to see that foreign (ie, American) manufacturers gain a 20% share of the Japanese chip market by the end of 1992. An earlier deal, struck in 1986, mentioned the same target, but only in a secret side-letter. In 1991, after America abandoned its floor-price for memory-chips and lifted punitive tariffs (costing $160m a year) from electronics imports, Japan agreed to write the 20% goal into the text of the agreement. It is nowhere near being reached. Depending on who measures it, foreigners now have a 14-16% share of the Japanese chip market.
America's Semiconductor Industry Association puts the shortfall down to unfair discrimination against foreign firms. Japanese firms reply that American manufacturers often fail to provide the products they want. ""Some don't care much, they don't spend resources in this market and I doubt their willingness to do so,"" says a manager in Fujitsu's chip division. As proof that American chip firms can succeed in Japan when they have a good product, he points to their success with the chips that provide computers with their calculating ability. According to Dataquest, a market-research firm, American manufacturers already have a 20% share of the Japanese microprocessor market. And American chip firms are doing better, not worse, in many other markets where they have tried harder. Their share of the world market has risen slightly since 1989, while Japan's has fallen (see chart). (Chart omitted)
Whatever the reasons for the failure of American firms to do better in the Japanese chip market, it is not clear that either country's government can do much about it. Officials at Japan's Ministry for International Trade and Industry can do little more than exhort companies to buy more foreign chips. ""They cannot force us to buy anything we don't need. We have to be able to buy only the goods we require,"" says Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC.
As for the American government, it cannot do much to assuage irate American chip producers. The floor-price system introduced in 1986, which was designed to help American producers compete with lower-cost Japanese manufacturers, collapsed because of complaints from American computer makers, who resented buying chips at artificially inflated prices. Punitive American tariffs on other Japanese products would be contrary to GATT rules.
Nevertheless, the Bush administration is talking tough. On May 27th the trade representative, Carla Hills, announced that the government would launch a formal review of the 1991 chip agreement and decide by August whether the Japanese were honouring it. ""If we find that the arrangement is not being complied with, we will take appropriate action. If we sign an agreement with someone, we expect them to live up to it,"" says one American official.
Whether this threat is real, or just pre-election bluster, remains to be seen. Some of Mrs Hills' recent remarks have been more conciliatory. Rather than let the 1991 deal collapse, the government may prefer to set the date for a 20% share back a few years. By then, governments may find that the battlelines between the American and Japanese chip industries have blurred. Over-supply and rising costs mean that memory-chips--25% of the $55 billion world chip market--are no longer profitable for anyone, including the Japanese. Worth $20 a year ago, 4-megabit chips sell for an unprofitable $12 or less. The price of the next generation of 16-megabit chips, now reaching the market, may fall as fast.
Small wonder, then, that some Japanese and American manufacturers are more willing to co-operate. Last year AT&T decided to design its 64-megabit chips jointly with NEC, and Texas Instruments signed a similar deal with Hitachi. Motorola and Toshiba are developing microprocessors for high-definition televisions together, as are Sanyo and LSI Logic. Other links exist between Intel and Matsushita, and between Advanced Micro Devices and Sony. If relationships of this sort prosper, then at least one Japanese-American trade sore will have healed itself."

Since he was appointed head of Thomson, France's electronics giant, in 1982, Mr Gomez has drastically reshaped the company, cutting the number of its businesses from 20 to three. Many admire his strong leadership, but others have always questioned whether he is leading Thomson in the right direction. Now his record is under scrutiny again as the French government begins its regular triannual job review of state-industry bosses. Mr Gomez will probably be reappointed in June. But a set of poor results at Thomson (see chart) has raised doubts about his strategy. (Chart omitted)
In the latest shift in tactics, Mr Gomez is masterminding a $450m takeover of the defence and aerospace businesses of LTV, a bankrupt American conglomerate. In April, Thomson-CSF, the French group's defence-electronics arm, and the Carlyle Group, a Washington-based investment bank, together outbid Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two American defence companies, for LTV'S defence businesses. Now Thomson is trying to convince the American government to let it keep LTV's missile business, while the Carlyle Group takes ownership of LTV's aerospace business.
Thomson faces an uphill task. Though LTV is a relatively small defence contractor, opposition to a French takeover is growing. A number of congressmen are worried about the bid's implications for national security. Thomson-CSF is confident that it can defuse these fears, but the fact that it is state-owned could scupper the deal.
If the LTV transaction does fall through, it might be a blessing in disguise. With defence budgets shrinking fast almost everywhere, Thomson-CSF is taking a big gamble by trying to expand its defence business through acquisition, even in the huge American market. Mr Gomez disagrees. As long ago as 1986 he predicted real declines in military spending. Thomson-CSF was one of the first defence firms in Europe and America to overhaul its business in preparation for defence cuts. Now Mr Gomez confidently predicts that military orders will grow later in the decade, though most others in the industry believe the opposite. And he argues that Thomson-CSF needs as big a share of the market as possible if it is to benefit from the upturn; hence his determination to gain a foothold in America, the world's biggest arms market.
However, Mr Gomez's obsession with size has already backfired in consumer electronics. While Thomson's slimmer defence subsidiary made a FFr2.4 billion ($425m) net profit last year, Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the company's bloated consumer-electronics subsidiary, made a FFr2.5 billion loss. That followed a similar loss by TCE, which publishes its own set of accounts, in 1990. Mr Gomez makes little secret of the fact that he wanted to pull Thomson out of consumer electronics years ago. But the French government vetoed a sale. Stuck with the business, Mr Gomez decided in 1987 to pay FFr3 billion for America's RCA to beef it up.
He also poured billions into high-definition television (HDTV), along with more money from the French government. But MAC, a standard developed by Thomson and Philips, is already looking outdated compared with some American and Japanese ones. To make matters worse, the European Commission has been unable to impose the European standard on broadcasters. Nursing FFr10 billion-worth of debt, TCE is now in serious trouble and says it needs FFr8 billion in new capital to get it back on its feet.
There lies the rub. TCE was due to receive FFr1.8 billion from the French government in 1991, but the European Commission blocked what it considered to be an unfair subsidy. Then the French government meddled in Thomson's affairs once again.
In December 1991 Edith Cresson, France's prime minister, unveiled plans to merge TCE and SGS-Thomson, the French group's loss-making semiconductor business, with CEA-Industrie, a state-owned nuclear-technology firm. The aim was to create a high-tech conglomerate modelled on Germany's Siemens. However, since Mrs Cresson's departure in April, the idea has been quietly abandoned. Mr Gomez refuses to say what will become of TCE.
One answer would be to sell the state's 59% stake in Thomson-CSF, held through Thomson, which is worth around FFr9 billion. That could provide TCE with the cash it badly needs to cut Its hefty debt and pay for new investment. It may make good business sense, but it is unlikely to suit France's interfering politicians."

On the national stage, Calpers is the champion of shareholder activism, calm but determined, a scourge of overpaid, lazy chief executives up and down the land. At home in California, the fund is not so self-assured. Powerful enemies plot to take away its riches. They disparage the kind of pensions it provides. The domestic bickering could cloud the star's public success.
Until now, the public face has been most noticed. With $68 billion of investments, Calpers is America's largest pension fund. Bulk makes it hard to trade in and out of shares. So, rather than sell stakes in poorly managed companies, Calpers uses its clout as shareholder to push for change. This year it has chosen 12 companies to work on: four paid their executives too much, four had too few independent directors, and four had resisted discussions with shareholders.
All 12 companies have taken Calpers seriously enough to respond. Nine have promised change; Calpers is still talking to the others. More independent directors and openness with shareholders may curb overmighty managers; Calpers cites General Motors, whose top management was shaken up by non-executive directors in April. Calpers hopes that, bit by bit, it will nudge most big companies towards installing boards able to impose such change.
This affects the shape of American capitalism, but perhaps no more profoundly than the debate on Calpers at home. For California's lead may sway other public-sector pension plans, whose money in turn sways markets in America and beyond. These funds have expanded prodigiously along with local-government payrolls and union campaigns for comfortable old age. Pensioners have won protection from inflation, new health benefits, better deals for widows. Local governments have set aside more to pay for these liabilities. A decade ago America's public pensions had $250 billion of assets. They have $850 billion now.
This ought to make pensions less controversial than they are in countries which pay for them from current taxes: think of Italy, where the tax bill for pensions approaches 14% of GDP. But the swelling of America's public pension funds has coincided with swelling public deficits; the temptation to raid the funds to balance budgets has proved strong. In 1991 seven states reduced, delayed or cancelled contributions to their pension plans. A long period of expanding benefits and savings may now be ending.
That is particularly true in California. Faced with a $14 billion deficit, Pete Wilson, California's governor, last year attacked the state's fund. Using a law passed at the height of the budget crisis, he seized $1.6 billion from Calpers. He also took the power to appoint the fund's actuary, claiming that those chosen by Calpers were too cautious. They had assumed low investment returns, and so set the contributions from taxpayers too high. If assumed earnings were boosted by one percentage point, the annual tax bill would fall by $400m.
The battle continues. In May the Democratic majority in the legislature refused for the third time to approve the Republican governor's chosen actuary, so Calpers remains without one. Public-sector unions have brought and lost a suit against the governor's action and are trying to appeal. Employees have also collected the 1m signatures needed to put a constitutional amendment on next November's ballot: this would prevent a repeat of Mr Wilson's raid. But not all Democrats are sympathetic.
PENSIONS IN DISNEYLAND
Dave Elder, the Democratic chairman of the assembly committee dealing with Calpers, reckons that pensions cost too much. He worries particularly about ""spiking"", the practice of boosting salaries just before retirement so as to justify higher pensions. One example: the city of Anaheim, Disneyland's home, raised its chief administrator's salary from $90,000 to $150,000. Calpers could expel cities that behave like this. Mr Elder suggests that it shrinks from doing so because it wants to remain America's biggest pension fund. That stings. Calpers protests that there may soon be two expulsions, the first for at least ten years.
Disability allowance is another painful issue. It is claimed by seven out of ten Highway Patrol officers, who leave the force taking half their salary. One San Francisco policeman qualified after losing his trigger finger. Two Longbeach policemen, punished for beating a black colleague, claimed on grounds of ""stress"". As with spiking, this excessive generosity is the work of local authorities, not of Calpers officials. But such incidents encourage Mr Wilson to believe that the pension system must be reined in.
The governor's most radical plan is to scrap traditional pensions. Like most big funds, Calpers promises employees a fixed proportion of their salaries on retirement. To meet this promise, employees surrender a fixed proportion of their wages to the scheme; employers (taxpayers) pay whatever more is needed. This shields employees from the risk of poor investment earnings. It may also lead unions and their political allies to lobby for ever bigger benefits.
Mr Wilson would rather not promise fixed benefits. He wants, instead, to pledge a fixed level of contributions; benefits would then depend on what the fund could afford. The first steps in this direction have already been taken. Last year the benefits offered to some categories of new employees were markedly reduced. As a result, the required contributions from the state have been cut by two-thirds. Mr Wilson's people hope this will encourage employees to opt into additional savings plans, run on the defined-contribution principle. Membership of such voluntary schemes has jumped from 15,000 to 65,000 over the past ten years.
Calpers is determined to resist further moves away from fixed benefits. Dale Hanson, its chief executive, declares that shifting to the new kind of pensions, which normally give members more discretion over their contributions, would depress savings rates and then depress old people too. Bill Crist, president of the Calpers board and a trade unionist, says that public-sector unions will resist pension cuts--even, he reckons, if this prompts local government to cut jobs.
To protect the fund from Mr Wilson, its officials must perform better politically. Mr Hanson came to California in 1987 from Wisconsin. He lacks friends in the state government. Last year communication with the governor's office virtually ceased; only one official remained on speaking terms with both sides. Partly to mend relations, in February Mr Hanson hired Jim Burton. He is a long-time Sacramento civil servant and prominent Democrat; his wife is a Republican who works for Mr Wilson.
Calpers is also using money to defend itself. Last year the board took this too far: there were hints of dumping shares in companies that supported the governor's attack on Calpers. This year the fund has switched to carrots. In January it announced a $225m investment in cheap housing in California. Funnily enough, Mr Wilson had recently written to the fund, wondering if it could help stimulate California's economy. Mr Hanson now talks of putting more money into local venture capital.
Calpers may buy time. But traditionally defined benefits are losing ground, in public pensions and in company ones. California's budget deficit has worsened since last year. And even if Mr Wilson were to keep his hands off Calpers, the federal government may not. Its Internal Revenue Service has a list of tax exemptions, ordered according to how much each adds to the federal deficit. Tax-free employer pension contributions come right at the top. The steady growth of pension funds has fuelled the rise of shareholder activism. The taxman may stop it."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224169722/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/47?accountid=14657,"Britain's long-running debate on corporate governance has traditionally ebbed and flowed with the economic cycle. In a recession companies go bust unexpectedly--as Polly Peck and the Levitt Group did in 1991. The cry goes up for better auditing, more shareholder activism and fresh curbs on dictatorial management. But when companies move into profit again and the stock-market recovers, the debate fizzles out.
Things may be different this time, as businessmen ponder their response to the committee chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury. Its draft report on financial aspects of corporate governance was published on May 27th*. The report's ideas--beefing up disclosure, clarifying auditing procedures, enhancing the role of non-executive directors, and improving links between companies and their mainly institutional shareholders--are mostly culled from existing best practice and institutions' own codes. The committee's biggest achievement was to win support for them from the many opposed interest groups that made up its membership. The difficulty will lie in putting the ideas into practice.
Cadbury's main notion is a code of best practice that it wants all company boards to follow. Among the committee's proposals:
* Non-executive directors, most of them truly independent, should be picked through a formal selection process and approved by the whole board. They should be able to take outside professional advice. Shareholders should approve all directors' contracts every three years.
* Companies should have audit and remuneration committees, either wholly (for audit) or mainly (for remuneration) made up of non-executive directors. They should disclose most details of directors' pay.
* To help balance the concentration of executive power in companies that combine the roles of chairman and chief executive--which Cadbury, along with others, thinks unwise--there should be an appointed leader of the non-executive directors.
* Interim statements should include balance-sheet details and be reviewed by auditors. Audit partners should be rotated and there should be fuller disclosure of non-audit work. Directors and auditors should take explicit steps to make sure that the business is a going concern. Auditors who alert the authorities to suspected fraud should perhaps be protected from legal action.
Together with new standards already being promulgated by the Accounting Standards Board to improve company accounts, these changes would give shareholders more information. They might even lead to better-run companies. But there are two problems with the Cadbury vision.
The first is that it relies heavily on non-executive directors to improve corporate governance. Yet companies already have trouble finding high-calibre people to serve. All FT-SE companies have at least one outsider; the average is six and rising. Companies may exaggerate the problem by trawling in a needlessly shallow pool. One group, PRONED, says it has a long list of suitable people who have yet to be called. Good governance depends on good governors.
The second, more serious problem is enforcement. The committee wanted to avoid being ""legalistic"" and may have ended up being ineffectual. It stopped short, for example, of suggesting a mandatory division of chairman from chief executive (though 72% of FT-SE companies do split the jobs) or a flat ban on auditors doing consultancy work. The committee hopes that institutional shareholders will press its code of practice, which in many ways resembles their own. The only reason for thinking they may succeed is that the Stock Exchange is to require all listed companies to disclose in their reports, from the end of 1992, whether they are following the code--and if not, why not.
This is supposed to embarrass potential backsliders into compliance. Yet it may not be enough. The committee wants to review progress after two years--and it hints that if a lot of companies lag, legislation could be the answer.

Pension funds are suspicious of futures: too many novices have been burnt. So who would dream of telling pension investors to buy commodity futures? Frank Russell, an American consultancy to pension funds, has published a paper suggesting just that.*
The argument begins with property. Investment advisers used to encourage pension funds to buy buildings in order to reduce the volatility of their portfolios. Property is a defence against jumps in inflation: it is a real asset, whose worth in terms of other goods and services should withstand swings in the value of paper money. Property therefore balances pension funds' holdings of nominal assets, such as bonds, whose real worth falls when inflation jumps. Just as a basket of equities from different industries and countries is less volatile than an undiversified portfolio, so a mix of nominal and real assets should steady a fund.
Unfortunately, property's other characteristics veil this virtue. It is expensive and difficult to trade, especially in a falling market. Buildings are not quoted on any exchange, so investors can only guess the value of their holdings. Pension funds would prefer real assets without such hassles. That, says Frank Russell, is exactly what commodities offer. Like property, commodities tend to benefit from unexpected jumps in inflation. And they are traded on liquid markets daily.
This idea takes some swallowing. Land may protect a fund against inflation, but the building on top of it also brings in rent: property therefore bears comparison with other income-generating assets. There is no income to be had from a bag of cocoa. Indeed, you have to pay to store it. That might be forgivable if, as with growth stocks, the capital value of commodities were expected to rise enough to compensate. Since 1970 The Economist's commodity index has fallen by a fifth, measured in real dollars. Attractive though diversification into real assets may be, the opportunity cost of tying up cash in commodities appears prohibitive.
Enter futures. In two ways, these enable investors to extract an income from their cocoa. A fund that buys 20 bags for delivery in six months need pay for only one initially: futures exchanges demand a margin of only around 5%. By rolling over the contract (selling it before it expires, then buying a new one with six more months to run), the fund can always avoid paying for the rest. It can therefore invest the other 95% in government bonds, and earn a risk-free income.
Second, contracts to buy commodities in the future tend to grow more valuable as the delivery date approaches. This is because the markets are dominated by producers trying to protect themselves. A mine might sell next year's output for less than the current price, the difference represents the cost of insuring against falling metal prices. Investors willing to buy a commodity in advance pocket this insurance premium. The more volatile the commodity's price, and the greater its cost of storage (the alternative to selling when the price is low), the higher the premium.
Are the returns from commodity futures big enough to be attractive? The chart plots the total returns--premiums, Treasury-bill yields, and commodity-price movements--to be had from holding the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index. The average annual return between 1972 and 1990 was 17%, better than the 11.7% return on the S&P 500 stock index or the 8.9% on medium-term bonds.
That result owes much to the bull market in commodities in the 1970s, when oil and gas (accounting for nearly half the index) did particularly well: rising prices in this period account for over half of commodities' total return. In 1981-90 commodity prices fell by 0.9% a year. Even so, insurance premiums and Treasury bills rescued the index. Average total returns came to 12.8% a year--worse than equities' 4.4% but a bit better than bonds' 12.1%.
Like many good opportunities, Frank Russell's proposal may sour once it is widely recognised. If pension funds weigh in, the insurance premium to be had from buying futures will quickly disappear, and might even turn negative. Indeed they are regularly negative in the case of a few commodities like gold and silver--buyers of futures pay a premium that reflects their Treasury bill income--and some commodity traders say they would not be surprised to see this spread to other parts of the market. So the case for commodity futures rests more on diversification than on juicy returns.
Here, too, different decades tell different stories. The returns from stocks and commodities moved against each other for much of the 1970s. As inflation and commodity prices calmed, however, the total commodity return began to reflect more heavily the performance of Treasury bills and insurance premiums, tracking the S&P 500. Between 1982 and 1990 the correlation between the two indices is roughly zero: commodities reduced a portfolio's volatility by diluting swings in stocks, rather than by moving against them. In the past year, however, a negative correlation returned, so commodities' stabilising effect was greater.
Does this outweigh the prospect of a low investment income? That depends on a fund's appetite for risk. Assuming that insurance premiums fall to zero, and that the stock-commodity correlation stays at zero, Frank Russell say that a client with average risk aversity should put 8.7% of its fund in commodity futures collateralised with Treasury bills.
This cheers Goldman Sachs, which would be only too delighted to help pension funds track its index. The investment bank's prospects should be brightened by the launch, expected in July, of a future on its index. This will be listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and will spare investors the trouble of buying the separate contracts that compose it.
But do not expect a rush of pension money. Funds dislike volatile assets with unpromising returns, even if they improve their portfolio by diversifying it. Think of the way American funds hedge currency risk, even though exchange-rate moves often cancel out other shifts in their portfolios. And think of how, having accepted that foreign equities serve to diversify risk, they have piled into first-world markets--precisely those that are most correlated with America's.

Now it is insurance's turn. Only the financially strong, with ready access to capital, can expect to survive intact. That is why Equitable Life, the fourth-biggest mutual insurer, is about to ""demutualise"". To shore up its depleted capital, the firm will transform itself into one owned by shareholders--as Richard Jenrette, the insurer's boss, promised in December 1990. On May 26th Equitable Companies, as the converted parent company will be known, filed an initial public offering (IPO) of 43.5m shares of common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other big mutual insurers are likely to follow.
It will be the largest conversion of a mutually owned insurance company since New York began to allow such conversions in 1988. When Equitable makes its offering later this summer, it hopes to raise $475m-600m. It expects to receive a further $750m from AXA, France's second-biggest insurance holding company, run by Claude Bebear. Last July AXA invested an initial $250m in Equitable in return for what will become an equity stake of up to 49%. Mr Jenrette talks of ""a global partnership with AXA, sharing expertise in insurance, investment management and technology.""
Mr Jenrette initially wanted to be the dominant partner in this arrangement, but New York's state regulators insisted that AXA put in enough capital to take at least a 40% stake. That suits Mr Bebear well enough. Quite as wily and worldly as Mr Jenrette, he believes the insurance world will end up dominated by 20 big companies--and he intends his greater AXA to be one of them. Oddly, under the terms of his investment, Mr Bebear will not know exactly how much of the new firm AXA will own until after a price is struck for the IPO. Most of the rest of the stock in the new Equitable will go to 2.2m eligible policy-holders who now own the company.
Equitable needs new money because it has lost so much of its own--including an operating loss of $290m in 1991 which helped to reduce its statutory capital from $2.1 billion in 1989 to $1.6 billion in 1991. Before that, the company had a bad boom. At the start of the 1980s, it pioneered Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs), retirement plans that promised savers a high fixed interest rate, usually for ten years. These looked wonderful business for Equitable when interest rates soared; horrible when they fell. Since 1983 Equitable has lost about $2 billion on GICs. At the peak, $15 billion of the contracts were outstanding; the company claims the worst is past.
Equitable, with $145 billion of assets currently under management, also fell into two of the blackest investment holes of the decade: junk bonds and commercial property. Other insurers made the same mistakes, but few lost as much. Along with Travelers and Aetna, Equitable is one of the three big insurance investors in the troubled developments of Olympia & York.
The insurer has been clawing its way out of its property pit. It has excised bad assets from a property portfolio worth nearly $20 billion. It has also become quick to foreclose on bust developers. Equitable does not want worries about a dodgy portfolio to discourage potential shareholders.
Much reassurance has been necessary. Before the AXA deal, problem mortgages were equivalent to nearly three-quarters of the firm's total capital. And more than 40% of Equitable's assets were in mortgages, equity property investments and junk bonds, compared with an average of 25% for similarly sized insurers. Those ratios would have made its IPO a hard sell even in a market with an appetite for new issues. Equitable wrote off $548m-worth of net assets in 1991, mainly property and junk bonds. How far this has solved its problems should be clear when the draft prospectus is published.
The insurer has also been cutting costs, by $123m last year in its core business. Most of all it has benefited from record earnings at two subsidiaries, Alliance Capital Management and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. The latter is the securities firm that Equitable bought in 1981, which Mr Jenrette had taken public a decade earlier. That may prove valuable experience. Mr Jenrette must convince investors not only that the battered insurer is fit for sale, but also that he can run it once it is owned by demanding shareholders."

On May 27th the bankers met in London to respond to Olympia & York's latest request for new money. The Reichmann Brothers' Canadian property firm had recently raised its estimate of the long-term credit the project needed from L300m ($540m)to L500m. This proved too much. Stiffened, it seems, by Britain's Barclays and Lloyds, and by O&Y's big Canadian creditors, the lenders said no more. O&Y was forced to seek the protection of a court-appointed administrator for Canary Wharf. The administrator has 90 days to find ways to repay creditors.
How much does it matter? A lot, to banks and to London. Lenders (including the European Investment Bank) have provided around L1.2 billion in credit to Canary Wharf. They now face provisions against potential losses of about half that figure. Barclays, Canary Wharf's main British lender, was also heavily exposed to another property developer, Mountleigh, which went into receivership on May 25th owing banks some L400m. So was Citicorp. Both may have been wise enough to foresee Mountleigh's demise; neither is likely to have predicted O&Y's.
Administration for Canary Wharf affects the shape of London. O&Y had promised L400m towards the building of a new tube line to Docklands. Without the banks' money, this link may now be delayed indefinitely. That would diminish the already slim chances of Canary Wharf, and other developments in Docklands, emerging as rivals to the traditional office districts in the West End and the City. Two-fifths of Canary Wharf stands empty. Despite the fountain, elegant trees and London's tallest tower, poor transport will deter prestigious tenants.
Could the plug be put back in again? Companies can emerge from administration as going concerns. Randsworth Trust, which owns L350m of British property, went into administration in March; its directors, who still run it, issue cheerful statements about the long-term prospects. But survival depends on finding new investors willing to stump up fresh money. Pension and insurance funds want occupied buildings, not empty ones.
So eyes will turn to the government. It will soon decide where to house several thousand civil servants, and says it is fixed on Docklands. The banks may hope that, by pushing Canary Wharf closer to the brink, they will induce the government to choose it. The government vows that its decision will be made on purely economic grounds. If Canary Wharf wins now, most will smell a bail-out."

The institute should be up and running in time for phase two of economic and monetary union (EMU), which is supposed to start in January 1994. Since the bank will grow out of the institute, the city that wins the institute, in effect, wins both.
The decision will not be based on enlightened consideration of where the bank could operate most effectively. The bank's fate will instead be settled in a Euro-bargain that will include other homeless EC institutions: the environmental agency, the trademark office, the pharmaceuticals agency, the European Parliament and others.
Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister of Portugal, which currently holds the EC presidency, hopes to arrange a deal at the Lisbon summit on June 26th-27th. If, as is likely, the task eludes him, the British will take on the job. There may be no bargain struck before the December summit in Edinburgh. Fittingly, that city announced this week that it wanted the ECB for itself.
It need not have bothered. Only Germany, Holland and Luxembourg stand a chance of winning the bank; only the British reckon that London (never mind Edinburgh) has a chance. Britain is at a disadvantage in the talks because a protocol in the Treaty of Maastricht states that it will participate in monetary union only if a future parliament votes in favour.
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, said in Dublin on May 20th that the City's role as Europe's leading financial centre made it the obvious home for the bank. As for the protocol, this did not mean ""that our underlying commitment to the success of economic and monetary union is any less than that of our friends elsewhere in the Community,"" he said. Underlying commitments are fine, but Britain's actual commitment does not extend to joining the union. Other governments are sticklers for details like that.
Frankfurt remains the favourite. Since EMU depends on German support, most reckon that if Chancellor Helmut Kohl insists, he will get the bank. He may well do so. Germans are doubtful about monetary union, fearing that the ecu will be a softer currency than the D-mark. Mr Kohl believes the best way to allay fear of inflation after EMU is to secure the new bank for Frankfurt.
The president of the Bundesbank agrees. Siting the ECB in Frankfurt would endow it with some of the Bundesbank's prestige, Helmut Schlesinger told the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe in that city on May 26th. ""Frankfurt has been a symbol of a successful currency since 1948. The ECB will start without a capital of confidence and trust, which it will have to earn, so the choice of Frankfurt would be rather positive."" Other countries that are worried about the strength of Germany's commitment to EMU may go along with this.
Britain and France think giving the bank to Frankfurt would boost its markets over those in London and Paris. They may be wrong for the ECB is likely to use national central banks as its operating arms. But that concern has pushed Amsterdam and Luxembourg into the reckoning. They are too small to threaten London, Paris or Frankfurt, and their governments have a quasi-Germanic record against inflation.
Holland's case is that (like Germany) it has no EC institutions, and that it narrowly missed the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Luxembourg's is that it deserves compensation for losing the secretariat of the European Parliament to Brussels. And the EC decided in 1965 that Luxembourg should host its financial institutions (it has the European Investment Bank). For the British, Luxembourg is the least bad alternative to London, as its markets are even tinier than Amsterdam's.
The French may prove decisive. Lyons and Strasbourg want the bank but the government has wisely decided not to back any French candidate. Its priority is to secure Strasbourg as the permanent home of the European Parliament's plenary sessions. There is talk of a deal with Germany: if the Germans back Strasbourg for the parliament, France may support them on the bank. But the French would insist that it be somewhere other than Frankfurt.
Such a compromise has its supporters in the European Commission. It would be up to the Germans to choose the alternative. Berlin would advertise the EC's hopes for Eastern Europe, but Bonn, which is losing the German government, might be a more obvious choice. Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, still says he wants Frankfurt. In the end, however, Germany would be delighted to have the bank anywhere."

On May 22nd Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni (INA), a big state-owned insurer, announced plans for an alliance with Banca di Roma, a new banking group to be formed in August by a three-way merger between Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, Banco di Santo Spirito and Banco (as it has till now been spelt) di Roma. The deal is Italy's widest-ranging yet.
In previous alliances between banks and insurers in Italy, the partners have agreed to swap products but not staff. In this one, however, Banca di Roma intends to set up shop itself in about 185 of INA's branches. It will also buy a fifth of Inabanca, INA's small banking operation. In return INA, already Italy's biggest life insurer, will sell policies through Banca di Roma's 1,200 branches and its 7,000 agents. It will also take over the bank's 17% stake in Fata, Italy's biggest agricultural insurer.
INA and the trinity of banks that will form Banca di Roma are delighted with the deal. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), a state-owned bank in which INA has a 20% stake, is not. It had hoped to join with the insurer itself. But INA wanted to be the exclusive provider of insurance products to the bank. BNL, which has its own insurance subsidiary and sales force, did not want to be tied down. When attempts to reach a deal failed in 1990, INA looked for another bank. Now that it has found one, it may well cut its links with BNL.
Other Italian insurers that have tied the knot with bank partners include the Fondiaria group, allied with Turin-based San Paolo; Toro, Generali and RAS, which have a joint venture called Assibanca with Milan's Banca Commerciale Italiana; and SAI, Italy's fourth-largest insurer, allied with Banca Popolare di Novara.
Why are insurers so keen to co-operate with bankers? The answer is that they hope the banks will help to break the powerful grip of Italy's hordes of insurance agents. The agents control three-quarters of insurance distribution in Italy, which allows them to dictate their own commissions. Direct marketing has yet to make a splash; bank branches are one of the few plausible alternatives to the agents.
As for the banks, selling insurance is one way to hang on to money that would otherwise disappear from cheap bank deposits. Done well, it can pay off handsomely. Take the case of Monte dei Paschi di Siena. Advised by Predica, the insurance arm of France's Credit Agricole, the Italian bank's insurance subsidiary, MontePaschi Vita, took in more than 200 billion lire ($160m) of premiums in its first six months after opening in May 1991.
Counting the INA deal, Sergio Pugliese, president of SP&A, a banking consultancy in Rome, reckons that some 85% of Italy's 16,000-odd bank branches are now providing insurance products. Yet there is plenty of room for growth. Banks account for just 2% of all Italian insurance premiums, mostly in the life business. And, given the dire state of Italy's public pension system, the demand for private savings schemes is sure to increase.
Italian banks must surmount several hurdles to succeed in bancassurance. Among them are the lack of nationwide banking networks, the poor standards of service in bank branches and the relatively limited range of insurance products available on the market. But MontePaschi Vita's experience shows that it can be done."

In April the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) saw its share of Nikkei futures traded worldwide rise to more than 30%. The Osaka Stock Exchange, domestic home of the Nikkei futures contract, was the big loser. It can blame Japan's ever-meddlesome finance officials, this time acting through Osaka's more powerful rival, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).
Tokyo reckons it is a double loser from futures. The Osaka Nikkei contract is much more popular than its own Topix stock-index futures contract. Also, officials think that futures trading has drawn volume away from the cash market, further depressing Tokyo's falling share prices. Early this year, encouraged by its minders at the finance ministry, the TSE set up a team to ponder how to control futures. Its report, when it comes, will be only the latest in a series of measures directed against futures trading.
The regulators have again shot themselves in the foot. By making it harder to trade futures, they have raised the cost of hedging risk and increased volatility in the underlying stockmarket. Their recent and unsuccessful attempt to make SIMEX introduce the same measures has only drawn attention to Singapore's greater merits.
There are three main reasons why many traders prefer Singapore to Osaka these days. One is that it is far cheaper to do business there than in Osaka. In the past two years the Japanese authorities have repeatedly raised commissions and margin requirements. Commissions were lifted three times in 1991 and doubled in March. Buyers of futures in Osaka now have to put up 30% of the value of the contract (compared with 13% on SIMEX), of which 13% must be a non-interest-bearing cash deposit.
A second reason is that prices in Osaka are allowed to move only within absurdly tight limits. Osaka lets the Nikkei contract move Y600 ($4.64) a day, or 3.3% at current market levels (SIMEX permits a 10% fluctuation). When orders are unbalanced (ie, when there are too many buyers or sellers at the indicated market price), the contract is allowed to move by an infinitesimal Y30 every five minutes. The Osaka market is often suspended for most of the day, especially when markets are jumpy, leaving traders with no domestic benchmark against which to buy and sell. On April 3rd, for example, the Osaka June futures contract traded in Osaka for less than 30 minutes, notes Salomon Brothers, a securities firm, while the SIMEX contract traded all day.
Osaka's electronic order-matching system aggravates the problem of tight price limits. SIMEX, by contrast, relies on Chicago-style open outcry, in which prices are set by locals yelling at each other in a trading pit. The snag with electronic matching is that futures trading throws up far more orders than trading in equities, says Nicholas Waltner, a futures man at Salomon in Tokyo. Osaka's system cannot cope with the rush of orders and the result is frequent imbalances. This would matter less if prices were allowed to move sufficiently to clear the market, but they are not. During those periods SIMEX becomes the market in which the price of Nikkei futures is set, with Osaka struggling to catch up.
Singapore looks likely to keep luring traders from Osaka, especially if the Japanese introduce further restrictions on futures. Politicians are pressing them to do so, to punish foreign securities firms. Foreigners are unpopular because they have made pots of money in the past 18 months arbitraging between stock-index futures and the persistently cheaper underlying shares. There is even talk that Osaka's Nikkei derivatives will be abolished.
Meanwhile, SIMEX seems bent on exploiting its advantages. It will no longer close for local public holidays when the Tokyo stockmarket is open. It plans to sell another 25 exchange seats, for at least S$180,000 ($110,500) apiece. The price of a seat is rising; Morgan Stanley, one of the biggest arbitragers in Tokyo, recently bought three Singapore seats for S$115,000-150,000 each. In March, against the vigorous opposition of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, SIMEX introduced a Nikkei option set against its own Nikkei futures contract. It is likely to be more popular than the Nikkei option traded in Osaka, which is set against the cash index. Options on futures are more easily and cheaply hedged.
Despite the bad blood between the TSE and SIMEX, Japanese officials have not tied Singaporean hands. In May the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, renewed SIMEX'S licence to use the Nikkei name. This gives Singapore three more years to make the most of its franchise--and Osaka to lose more business."
30-May-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224143922/fulltext/A0193A8AE2DC48F6PQ/54?accountid=14657,"Despite the collapse of the Tokyo stockmarket, slumping property prices and consequent fears about a credit crunch, most economists still expect Japan to escape a real recession. In The Economist's mid-May poll of economic forecasters (see the issue of May 16th), our panel's average forecast for growth in Japan was 2.3% for this year and 3.8% in 1993. Even the gloomiest of our seers expects GNP to rise by 1.3% this year; the cheeriest is betting on 3% growth.
The biggest risk to these forecasts, indeed perhaps the biggest risk to world economic recovery, lies with the fragile state of Japan's financial system. Some argue that its ills could have serious consequences for growth at home and abroad. The chief worry is that if share and property prices continue to slide, this will trigger a severe credit crunch.
Lower equity prices make it more difficult for banks to meet the BIS capital-adequacy rules. Falling property prices mean that banks face large losses on their property-related loans. Banks' attempts to restore their capital positions may require them to cut their lending sharply, squeezing investment, especially that of small-and medium-sized firms which depend most on bank loans for finance. Business investment accounted for fully half of all GNP growth in the three years to 1990.
Japanese companies depend more on bank debt than their American counterparts. In 1990 the ratio of firms' net debt (ie, after deducting their interestbearing deposits) to pre-tax profits was 5.4, well above corporate America's ratio of 4.3. Moreover, whereas in the past many Japanese firms enjoyed more flexibility in servicing their bank loans thanks to the close relationship between Japanese banks and corporate borrowers, this flexibility could vanish as banks come under strong pressure to increase their capital and improve their profits.
Bank lending has already dropped sharply in Japan, but so far it seems to reflect weak credit demand rather than inadequate supply. In fact most economists reckon that Japan will escape a full-blown credit crunch. But what if they are wrong? A study in the London Business School's latest International Economic Outlook considers the possible implications for the Japanese economy and for the rest of the world.
Chris Allen and David Currie have tried to simulate the effects of a severe credit crunch in Japan using the LBS'S international model. Their initial analysis suggests that a credit crunch would be equivalent to a four percentage-point rise (roughly a doubling) in the corporate real cost of capital, They show that the impact of a credit crunch on Japan's economy depends crucially upon how the Bank of Japan reacts. If, in its enthusiasm to eliminate inflation and prove its independence from politicians, the bank maintains interest rates on an unchanged path as if the credit crunch had not happened (this actually involves a small rise in interest rates from 1993), then consumer spending and investment could be badly hit. Japan's GNP growth rate would, according to the LBS model, be reduced by 1.2 percentage points in 1992, to just 0.7%, and by 1.7 percentage points in 1993. By 1994 the level of output would be more than 3% lower than in the base forecast.
The impact of the credit crunch is worsened by a modest rise in the yen which squeezes Japan's exports. The yen strengthens for two reasons: first, because Japanese bank lending abroad (ie, a capital outflow) drops off; and second, because slower growth squeezes inflation, which in turn implies higher real interest rates. So far as the rest of the world is concerned, the less competitive yen helps to support American and European exports, which largely offsets the contractionary effects of sluggish growth in Japan. By 1994, for example, America's output is no lower than in the base forecast (ie, assuming no credit crunch); the average loss in Europe is, according to the model, a mere 0.1% of output.
But what happens if the Bank of Japan tries to mitigate the effects of the credit crunch by reducing interest rates (in real and nominal terms) enough to maintain the growth in the money supply? If the Bank of Japan cuts interest rates so they are 134 percentage points lower than in the base case in 1993, then the yen initially falls by about 7%, to Y142 to the dollar. This improves Japan's trade position enough to offset most of the adverse domestic impact of the credit crunch, leaving growth virtually unchanged this year and less than half a point lower in 1993 than in the base forecast. Lower interest rates also help to boost domestic demand and to support property and share prices, which helps to raise banks' capital and hence their lending capacity.
In this case, rather than Japan bearing the full brunt of the credit crunch, the impact is exported abroad. Interest-rate cuts spread the effects internationally. America's output would be trimmed by 0.2% in 1993 compared with the base forecast; Germany's would be 0.5% lower. This also implies that Japan's current-account surplus would widen even further, to an estimated $94 billion in 1993--ie, $20 billion bigger than in the base forecast. America should perhaps remember this the next time it pressures Japan to cut its interest rates: lower Japanese interest rates mean a cheaper yen and hence a bigger Japanese trade surplus.
Economic simulations like this are obviously crude. They are only as good as the economic model they are based upon and the assumptions made. For example, the model fails to take account of possible spillover effects on other countries' stockmarkets, or tighter lending conditions abroad. Nevertheless, such simulations can provide useful analysis for policy-makers and hence for investors.
Indeed, this is what economic models are primarily intended to do, rather than churn out crude economic forecasts which grab the most attention. In this case, for example, it is impossible to predict whether the Tokyo stockmarket will fall another 10-20%, and whether a credit crunch will therefore result. But what these simulations do show is that the consequences of a crunch need not be as adverse as many doomsters expect: if necessary, the Bank of Japan could offset most of the impact on the real economy."

He knew by heart the forms of the southern clouds at dawn on 30th April 1882, and could compare them in his memory with the mottled streaks on a book in a Spanish binding he had only seen once.
At the same time, he lost the ability to make sense of these sights.
Not only was it difficult for him to comprehend that the generic symbol dog embraces so many unlike individuals of diverse size and form; it bothered him that a dog at 3.14 pm, seen from the side, should have the same name as the dog at 3.15 pm, seen from the front. His own face in the mirror, his own hands, surprised him every time he saw them.
Jorge Luis Borges did not mention it when he told this story, but Funes might as well have been a computer. Machines are expert at recording and storing images, but cannot make even the most rudimentary sense of them without help. Tasks that humans do not even recognise as such--the recognition that a landscape in sunlight is the same as a landscape in shadow, or that a man on a donkey is not one animal--leave computers flummoxed. Deflummoxing them would open new markets, and make lots of money.
The simple ability to see things and compare them with the way they should be, without any more complex understanding of what they are, can be useful. Cognex, a software company founded by artificial-intelligence researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), writes programs that enable computerised manufacturing tools to check the quality of their work. Shinkawa, a Japanese chip maker, now has welding tools which, thanks to the Cognex program, can use cameras to guide themselves as they fit semiconductors into their tiny containers, a job that used to be supervised by men with microscopes. Sanyo uses Cognex's programs to assemble circuit boards; Kirin uses them to check the quality of the glass its beer bottles are made from.
Unsurprisingly, the defence industry is interested in these abilities, too. Sandia National Laboratories has developed an optical processor that can pick out distinctive features in a scene. Current demonstrations involve toy tanks hidden among plastic ""bushes"" on a table top, but Terry Stalker, the leader of the project, hopes that within three or four years his invention will have found its way into real weapons. As well as recognising targets, seeing weapons could do their own map-reading. Today's cruise missiles navigate by radar, which works badly on landscapes that are flat or blurred by snow. Add in some visual skills--the ability to spot colour, for example--and some of those problems would disappear.
To deal with a picture, whether of a tank or a beer bottle, most computers start by converting the tiny dots of varying colours and shades that it is made of--pixels--into a set of numbers. In a simple world, one that contains only well-defined shapes, like cones or cubes, standing out clearly against a plain background, it is quite easy to look at where the pixel numbers suddenly get different, and thus pick out an edge. From the edges, it is possible to work out shapes. British Telecom has used a version of this technique to monitor traffic at railway crossings. A computer reduces video images from a camera to simple black-on-white shapes, and compares them to three shapes in its memory--those of a saloon car, a pedestrian in mid-stride, and a bicyclist. When it finds a match, it records the passage of the appropriate object.
The trouble is that in simplifying the image so that a computer can deal with it, much is lost. Also, the world can be just too complicated for the machine. Odd vehicles (such as camper vans) and multiple images (such as posses of cyclists) confuse the poor thing. To deal with more subtle pictures, a different approach is needed. Take the eerie skill of recognising faces. One approach being tried at MIT'S Media Lab is to make the computer measure differences between a particular face and faces in general.
The Media Lab computer takes a group of 100 or so faces, broken down into pixels, and generates a few ""Eigen-faces"" from them. These look like fuzzy photographic negatives, with the parts of the face that differ most among the faces in the sample lighter than the parts that tend to be the same. A bright spot on an Eigen-face's forehead might mean that some of the people whose faces it is made up from had fringes, some not. A white halo round an Eigen-face's head means that the head-shapes in the sample differed. Next, the computer takes the face it wants to recognise, and measures its similarity to the Eigen-faces.
The technique works--after a fashion. Alex Pentland, head of the project, says that his machine can recognise people, but only among small groups. The obvious role it could have in security svstems remains out of reach, as long as people can use make-up. But even such limited face-recognition skills have applications. Control Data, a computer company, has used the Media Lab's program to build a system that monitors television viewers. Trained on a living-room sofa, the monitor can tell which member of a family is watching which programmes--a potential boon for advertisers.
SEARCHING THE IMAGE MORGUES
The broadest use of computer vision, though, may be in looking through databases, not looking at the world. Computer and telephone companies hope that once computers can search electronic picture libraries in the flexible way that humans do, lots of new uses for these libraries will emerge. Today, searching through picture libraries means searching through the verbal descriptions that make up picture catalogues. The problem with this is that cataloguers cannot know what aspects of the pictures future users will consider relevant. If computers could pick out the features of a scene and understand what they were, users could give them far more flexible commands--and the laborious task of labelling would disappear.
Again, full understanding is not a realistic goal. More visual forms of cataloguing, though, are possible. Researchers at IBM have a system that allows the librarian to highlight salient features on a picture that is being stored--features obvious to a human but not to a computer. The idea is that a user can sketch an outline of the sort of thing he wants and the computer will then try to match it with a highlighted region in a picture it has stored. Wayne Niblack, one ofthe researchers, says that from a database of more than 1,000 random snapshots, his machine can reliably retrieve pictures of San Francisco's pointy Transamerica building and of fish. It's a start.
Such a system is clearly best suited to objects with characteristic shapes. But images need not be seen as collections of objects; they can be perceived just as ""stuff"". This approach, in favour at the Media Lab, means teaching computers to look for repetitiveness and orientation in their data--which correspond to textures and patterns in pictures. This is the only way to recognise crowds, water and other things without characteristic shapes. ""Stuff"" recognition could also be used as a first stage in ordinary ""thing"" recognition. By sorting a picture into patches of different textures, computers can find the edges of the objects within it, and then match the shapes with those they have on record. However, the sophisticated skills of a librarian--even a blind one like Borges--are still a long way from the computer's grasp."

Sir Richard Doll, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, demonstrated the association between smoking and lung cancer in the 1950s. Since then, links with other diseases have been found. But even now the appalling dimensions of tobacco-related death are only just being calculated.
A study published in last week's Lancet estimated the total number of deaths due to tobacco in the developed world. The authors looked a lung-cancer rates and used them as a marker for all smoking-related deaths. Epidemiology shows that fewer than one-third of smoking-related deaths are due to lung cancer. Vascular diseases, especially of the heart and brain, chronic airways disease, and other smoking-related cancers such as mouth and throat tumours account for most of the remaining deaths. Using a country's lung-cancer rate and formulae linking the rate of lung cancer to that of other smoking-related diseases (derived from a study of 1m Americans), the researchers estimated the proportion of deaths from all tobacco-related diseases.
On this basis, they forecast that one-fifth of the people now living in the developed world--more than 250m people--may die prematurely of smoking-related diseases. Some 21m of these deaths will occur in this decade. Of course, everyone dies of something. But these deaths come early. Half of them will strike people between the ages of 35 and 69; the unfortunates in this group will on average die 23 years before their non-smoking peers.
Many of the dead will be women. Though they took up smoking later than men, women in affluent countries are catching up. They are dying at a rate of 500,000 a year, mostly in America and Britain, where women have been smoking longer. Richard Peto, one of the authors of the Lancet report and the head of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's Oxford research unit, puts it bluntly: ""If women smoke like men, they will die like men."" By the time today's young women reach middle age, more than 1m women a year in developed countries will be killed by tobacco.
Mr Peto and his colleagues hope to refine their indirect, approximate forecasts by making direct observations. Ten centres around the world are collecting data for the Oxford group. A Polish study may help to explain why smoking appears to cause more harm in Eastern Europe than elsewhere. Current projections suggest that half of all Polish men aged 35 should expect to die before 70, with about half of these deaths tobacco-related.
Data from India and China will make it possible to assess the effect of tobacco on developing countries. One-third of the world's cigarettes are smoked in China. Like western women, people in poor countries are relatively new smokers, and in many places the effects of the habit are not yet visible. They will become so."

This Sunday he will attempt to raise the record to six as he guides his Williams car around the streets of Monte Carlo. Guides it, that is, with a lot of help from computers.
In the guise of Electronic Control Units (ECU), computers are no strangers to the track. They have long been used for managing the engine's performance--something a human is ill-equipped to do. They also collect data on the car's behaviour and radio them back to the pits to tell the team's engineers about the car's strengths and weaknesses. This system could be used to send instructions to the car during the race eg, to change the fuel mixture); but, for the moment, teams prefer to make the changes themselves when the car comes into the pits.
The use of on-board ECUs for jobs that drivers could do, rather than for jobs that drivers could not do, came into its own in 1989, when Ferrari introduced a semi-automatic gearbox. Williams did the same in 1991. Both teams had found that the quest for more horsepower had led to engines that needed many gears to perform at their best. That meant more time spent changing gear: time spent not accelerating. At a circuit like Monaco, drivers change ear every two seconds or so. To minimise the time required for the 3,000 changes in such a race, the Williams team has replaced the traditional gearstick with a switch on the steering wheel which electronically activates the gearbox's selection mechanism. The resulting gear change is much faster; it is also less tiring for the driver.
McLaren has gone one better. Its cars have fully automatic gearboxes. By automatically changing up when required, this system allows the driver to keep his foot down on the throttle all the time. To change down, the driver still presses a button, but the computer will delay the change if it would result in an over-revved engine. The system could change down automatically, but the drivers feel more confident doing it manually.
It is ""active suspension"", though, rather than the gearbox, that gives Williams its greatest edge. To understand why, think of a Formula-1 car as an inverted wing: the air passing around the car pushes it down (with a force six times the car's weight) rather than lifting it. Roughly 35% of this downward force is produced by the air in the gap between the car and the track. Keeping that at the right size, to within a millimetre or so, is vital to the car's performance and stability. Williams has achieved this by replacing the conventional springs and shock absorbers with a hydraulically operated, computer-controlled system. This automatically compensates for variations caused by braking, accelerating and cornering, as well as for the lost weight of used fuel.
All these applications need light, powerful and robust ECUs, capable of withstanding the vibration, high temperatures and accelerations experienced inside a Formula-1 car. McLaren's gearbox ECU weighs just 300 grams, has 4m bytes of memory and can issue 10m instructions per second. TAG Electronic Systems, part of the TAG McLaren Group, is currently developing a 2kg ECU which will run the engine, gearbox and suspension. It will issue 110m instructions per second.
Less sophisticated relatives of these ""drive by wire"" systems may soon be used in production cars. Anti-lock braking systems, which stop drivers from locking their brakes by braking too hard, are already common. Saab has a prototype car with electronic joystick-controlled steering. Meanwhile, Formula-1 drivers are increasingly just Formula-1 passengers. Soon even the meagre pleasures of changing down may be lost. And there is even talk of an automatic starting system, which would set the car moving as soon as it saw a green light. Before long, Formula-1 drivers may have little more to do than the captains of fully automated aircraft."

In principle, there are two different kinds of solar wobble to be seen, but only one sort--the ""pressure modes""--has been much studied. When, in 1984, three teams of observers claimed to be able to see the other sort of wobble--""gravity modes""--theorists told them they were mistaken. Now some are changing their minds.
Pressure modes, also called p-modes, are transmitted like sound waves: as a series of rarefactions and compactions. Gravity modes, on the other hand, are caused by buoyancy; when a bit of the sun is pressed down, the denser stuff below pushes it back up. Most theorists believe these g-modes to be unobservable with today's instruments. Although their amplitudes are fairly large at the sun's core, they decrease exponentially as they approach the surface. Coming from the depths may make the g-modes hard to see, but it also makes them worth looking for. They should provide new insights into the sun's deepest regions.
With their current knowledge of those depths, modellers can predict the range of g-mode frequencies--their spectrum. The spectra seen in the observations published in 1984 agreed neither with the predictions of then-current models, nor with each other. So they were broadly ignored, and subsequent work by one of the observing teams, Henry Hill of the University of Arizona and his Chinese collaborator Ye-ming Gu, has proved hard to publish. Arthur Cox of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, widely respected for his work on p-modes, thinks that papers by Dr Hill and Dr Gu have fallen victim to prejudice; the belief that g-modes are unobservable meant that journals refused to publish them.
The scepticism may have been reinforced by Dr Hill's track record. In 1982 he suggested that the sun's interior spins faster than Einstein's theory of relativity would allow. His evidence was not at all convincing, and such lese majeste' does not go down well. Since 1984 work by Dr Hill and Dr Gu has appeared in obscure journals like Science in China and in conference proceedings, not in the mainstream, refereed journals of astronomy.
Now, however, David Guenther, Pierre Demarque and their colleagues at the Yale Centre for Solar and Space Research have developed a more detailed model of the sun's insides, incorporating new knowledge about the rate of nuclear fusion at the sun's core and the opacity of its hot gases. They were surprised to find that predictions from the new model fit well with what Dr Hill and Dr Gu had been saying. The observations made by another team were close; the third team's results still did not fit.
The Yale solar models have already been successfully used for p-mode analysis. Other models, like those of John Bahcall at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and Roger Ulrich of the University of California at Los Angeles, two front-runners in the field, agree with the Yale model to within one part in a thousand. So were Dr Hill and Dr Gu right? Dr Cox thinks so, but some of his peers are still sceptical.
The issue may turn on experimental method. Dr Ulrich of UCLA points out that no independent observer has been able to confirm what Dr Hill and Dr Gu have reported. They have a unique method, studying tiny movements at points exactly opposite each other on the sun's edge. Most of the other groups look for the ""Doppler shift"" in the light caused by the solar surface moving in and out.
Douglas Gough of Cambridge University, a leading helioseismologist, is unconvinced as yet. He argues in favour of scrutinising the whole disk of the sun. Since g-modes are global oscillations, they should show up all over the place simultaneously. He also wants long continuous observations. This is the aim of the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), which will be a girdle of telescopes around the earth capable of monitoring the sun 24 hours a day. SOHO, a satellite observatory built jointly by NASA and the European Space Agency and scheduled to be launched in 1995, will make exact measurements of the sun's diameter.
Meanwhile, one Yale astronomer, Sabatino Sofia, has designed an experiment that uses the same method as Dr Hill and Dr Gu but, mounted on a satellite, would be 1,000 times more sensitive. He has flown the instrument on balloons, and is now negotiating with Italy's space authorities for room on a satellite. And the modellers have set their sights yet farther into space. Dr Guenther's group and some Australian colleagues are preparing models of two nearby stars, Alpha Centauri A and B. If repairs correct the Hubble Space Telescope's blurry vision in 1993, observations of such stars may provide tests that can turn solar models into stellar ones."

The approach of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro has led to a torrent of good-earthery, much of it between hard covers. People fling about words like ""Armageddon"" and ""collapse"", and pledge themselves to change their ways (and the world's) with all the fervour of a television evangelist. Even otherwise hard-headed businessmen sometimes get carried away. They talk about the need to bring sustainable development to the boardroom, and ecological responsibility to the market.
Such emotion risks overwhelming sound judgment. All environmental problems are not equally grave. Few pose a threat to the health of people in developed countries. Without the compelling intervention of government, not many of the problems are likely to be solved by a change in human behaviour. But such government intervention, if carefully designed, can win the cooperation of businessmen, who are beginning to see that they sometimes have a commercial interest not just in obeying environmental regulations, but in anticipating them.
""Beyond the Limits"" uses a computer model to predict environmental collapse. It beats drawing straight lines, but not by much. Twenty years ago, the authors' model of the links between population and economic growth and the environment was published by the Club of Rome in ""The Limits to Growth"". The market was ripe for gloom, and the book sold 9m copies.
Yet some of the book's most dismal predictions point mainly to the perils of extrapolation. In the two decades since it fretted about the exhaustion of non-renewable resources, the world's proven reserves of oil, gas and coal have continued to rise faster than consumption has increased. The rate of growth of the world's population, though still terrifyingly high, has slowed. And world food production per head has increased, although not in every country or in war-torn regions like the Horn of Africa.
The latest set of computer graphics sketches a future where the number of people outstrips the supply of food and natural resources. Even with technologies that harvest resources more efficiently and use them more frugally, the authors argue, ""the accumulated cost of the technologies"" finally stops economic growth.
Really? Not on the basis of experience. For the past century markets have repeatedly come up with technologies that use oil, metals and other resources more frugally. Only resources that cannot easily be priced have been over-exploited--ie, those open to all-comers, like shoals of fish or the waste-absorbing capacity of the atmosphere.
Al Gore got green religion when his young son was nearly killed in a car accident, an event the good senator often describes in his highly effective environmental speechifying around the United States. The book is a sort of ecological travelogue: the senator dashes from the Aral Sea to the rain forest to a tent in the Arctic to a scuba dive in the Caribbean. If that's environmentalism, it sounds fun.
Mr Gore is not given to understatement. Irritated by the reluctance of President Bush to go to the Earth Summit, Mr Gore recalls the failure of America in the 1930s to grasp the threat Kristallnacht posed to Germany's Jews. ""Once again world leaders waffle...Yet today the evidence of an ecological Kristallnacht is as clear as the sound of glass shattering in Berlin.""
Mr Gore's finest moment in the book is his admission that, by repeatedly voting for subsidies for sugar-cane, he contributed to the destruction of Florida's beautiful Everglades. ""I have decided...that I can no longer vote in favour of sugar-cane subsidies,"" he swears. If only most senators showed such good sense. His other sound ideas--grandly packaged as ""a global Marshall plan""--include a carbon-dioxide tax, the elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies and public spending, and more information for consumers on the environmental impact of products.
A remarkable thing about the Earth Summit is how companies are involved in the event. Stephan Schmidheiny has put aside his own Swiss business for a year to involve companies in the preparations. He set up the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD), 50 ""business leaders"" who have written guidelines for environmentally friendly behaviour by companies.
In their book, Mr Schmidheiny and his pals have latched on to the fact that industry can sometimes benefit from government environmental policies. There is therefore method in their seeming madness when they push measures which companies have lobbied furiously against, including an end to energy subsidies and (more halfheartedly) more disclosure of environmental information.
Well-run companies often benefit from carefully designed, consistently applied government environmental policies. They find, to their delight, that they can meet the higher standards which governments demand but that their less efficient competitors cannot. Environmental standards, as free-traders grumble, can be an effective way of protecting a market.
The BCSD offers lots of examples of companies that have done well by doing good. That has irritated green lobbyists like Friends of the Earth, who see businessmen as improbable collaborators and grumble that ""business wants to help protect the environment--but on its own terms."" If only more greens and bosses could see how often they have a shared interest in environmental protection, the limits to growth would recede even further towards eternity."

The radical question this book poses is not merely whether Judaism is compatible with contemporary thought or is statistically holding its own. It is whether Jewish life is tenable in contemporary ""post-assimilation culture""--a culture where, rather than simply conform to the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) model, as America's ""melting pot"" ideal formerly enjoined, Americans are free to pick and choose from a promiscuous array of values and behaviour.
Interweaving their own analyses with lengthy soliloquies from a wide variety of American Jews, the authors conclude that American Jewry has little future. Yet, in good post-modern fashion, their pessimistic conclusions are unwittingly undermined by the vitality of the individual voices of the chorus.
The broad range of Jewish experience in the United States is reflected in the varying avenues of affiliation and belonging of the people they interview: Zionism, social activism, New Age spirituality, traditional orthodoxy, campaigning against anti-Semitism, to name a few.
Their accounts of the lives of Jewish families and individuals are distinctive, quirky, often arresting: a liberal rabbi so eager to keep his synagogue up to date that his liturgy becomes a parody of upper-middle-class sensibility; a professional couple in Manhattan who combine rigorous orthodox practice with a zest for modern art; women struggling to reconcile their traditional faith with feminist consciousness; an intellectual who, notwithstanding her doubts, embraces Judaic tradition for its ""civilising discipline"".
The authors examine these forms of identity and affiliation and find them incapable of sustaining a commitment into the future. They offer exceptionally lucid social analysis as to why this should be so: that persecution alone is no basis for a community of faith; that the years of the ""melting pot"" and the destruction of the great centres of Jewish learning during the Holocaust have left most American Jews knowing little about their history and culture; that many tailor their Judaism to fit contemporary mores; that many are drawn to religion not out of obedience to the word of God but from recognisably human desires for community and continuity.
All this is true. Much of contemporary American Jewish life is shallow and ambiguous. But the authors tread on thin ice when, in their closing chapter, they move beyond empirical analysis to dismiss these forms of identity as ipso facto of little or no religious significance. They make this strong claim on the grounds that these identities are ""constructed and chosen,"" rather than ""objective and imposed ...the conditions for the maintenance and continuity of a separate historical community of faith are undermined."" This argument, although powerful, is wrong.
Modern, liberal societies do pose daunting challenges to traditional religions, and particularly to Judaism's rare combination of peoplehood and universalist belief. But the freedom of liberal society, while it inevitably loosens the power of communal ties and ecclesiastical authority, does not by itself undermine the seriousness of the choices its members make. On the contrary, liberalism endows choice with dignity, and those who do accept spiritual discipline and communal responsibility under modernity's bemused agnosticism may be all the more impressive."

But James Pickles was never part of the British judicial tradition. His unusual approach to the business is explained early on in his autobiography*: his uncle was a famous radio comedian, his father an amateur actor, and his sister and daughter soap-opera actresses.
Mr Pickles, who retired from the bench last year, was never a great judge but he became a famous one. He came into the public eye through some peculiar judgments--a woman who said she was beaten up by her boyfriend, for instance, was sent to jail because she was too frightened to give evidence. And once he achieved prominence, he began to enjoy blowing raspberries at the Establishment.
A self-consciously salt-of-the-earthish Yorkshireman, he loathes the snobbery that characterises much of the British judiciary. Class resentment combined with exhibitionism turned him into a delight for the press and a nightmare for targets like Lord Hailsham, then Lord Chancellor, and Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice. He goes on about Eton, Oxford and inherited privilege at tiresome length, but he has a serious point. Those brought up to believe themselves superior to the rest of the world may not be the best people to pass judgment on it.
In practical terms, his dispute with his superiors centres on the media. According to rules established in 1955, judges were not allowed to express their opinions publicly outside court. Mr Pickles argues that these rules enhance the stuffy self-righteousness of judges, and that judges should be allowed, and indeed encouraged, to explain themselves to the outside world. Mr Pickles nearly got himself sacked for doing so, but the present Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay (a not particularly posh Scot who Mr Pickles reveres) decided it was all right so long as no payment was involved. Mr Pickles was therefore free to continue his music-hall career, and any other judge who chose to was free to expose his soul to the world at large. There has not been a rush.

He is not normally thought of as a still-life painter on the order of Chardin or Cezanne. The improbable, however, becomes self-evident at ""Picasso and Things"", an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art that runs from June 9th to August 30th and then moves to the Grand Palais in Paris, where it opens on September 29th.
The exhibition shows why John Richardson, his biographer, is able to suggest that the artist explored the genre of still life ""more exhaustively"" and developed it ""more imaginatively than any other artist in history"". During his career, Picasso painted hundreds of pictures that can properly be characterised as still lifes.
Still lifes are traditionally composed from such domestic objects as flowers, crockery, books, candlesticks and food. Whatever the ostensible theme, the still-life painter usually tries to convey the physical presence of things--their colour and form, how they reflect light and articulate space, and the way they harmonise or contrast with each other.
All the real still-life painters, even those who inject symbolism into the mix, have been able to establish this material quality. But only during his Cubist period, just before the first world war, did Picasso treat objects purely as material things, to be fragmented and submerged within an overall design. He could hardly have done otherwise: Cubism is totally objective, it does not permit sentiment or symbolism. This Cubist period apart, Picasso's still lifes express emotions, moods and myths more than they evoke the physical presence of objects, which is why the viewer has to be persuaded to see him as a still-life painter.
As Mr Richardson observes in his biography, Picasso regarded still life as a metaphor for sex and for ""all manner of conflicts and confrontations"". For example, he might represent himself as a bottle and his paramour as a jug. The pictures confirm that he often used still life to express feelings or release emotional tension. Throughout his life, his still lifes document each new love affair, although never explicitly.
The exhibition, organised in six chronological sections, begins in 1901, when Picasso was 20, and ends in 1969, when he was 87. Each section reflects the artist's aesthetic agenda and the state of his emotions during that period.
For subjects, Picasso chose ordinary things that he invested with symbolic gravity. He was never much interested in flowers, but food and the guitar figure prominently in his early still lifes. During the 1920s he began to paint figures in a neo-classical style, but Cubism continued to inform his still lifes. It is as if he were following two road maps simultaneously, one directing him to a serene monumentality, the other to a nervous, angular modernity. When he had a happy liaison with a young mistress in the 1930s, his still lifes became more vivacious. Then, during the years of the Spanish civil war and of the second world war, when he lived alone in German-occupied Paris, his pictures were sombre reflections on anxiety and isolation.
A painting of a tomato plant dated August 1944, the month Paris was liberated, stands as a metaphor for survival, hope and renewal. By now the skull, the traditional emblem of mortality, has become a prominent motif, presaging a preoccupation with death in his late work."

Several opened within days of each other--something that has not happened in New York since the musical-comedy belle epoque ended in the mid-1960s--and their success has boosted ticket sales everywhere. According to Variety, a show business weekly, business has seldom been better in New York's theatre district.
In fact, however, few of these ""new"" musicals comedies are truly new, which is why the New York Drama Critics Circle declined to pick a best new musical this season. ""Falsettos"" comprises two musicals welded together that were previously produced, a decade apart, off Broadway. ""Crazy for You"" is a re-working of the Gershwins' 1930 ""Girl Crazy"". ""Jelly's Last Jam""--certainly the most innovative of the new productions--uses music by Jelly Roll Morton, whose heyday was in the 1920s. ""Guys and Dolls"" was a hit in the 1950s, and those critics who have gone overboard about it seem to have forgotten its excellent revivals at New York's City Centre in the 1960s, an all-black Broadway version that ran in 1976 and the superb production at London's National Theatre in 1982.
Nonetheless, the particular success of ""Guys and Dolls"" is not surprising. It is one of the most perfect musical-comedy confections. No recent British pop opera can offer its blend of raucous Broadway sentiment and hilarious, in-character lyrics, set to music that sets off fireworks every few minutes.
""Guys and Dolls"" is the capstone in a revival year for Frank Loesser (1910-69), its composer-lyricist who moved from a musical home steeped in the classics to vaudeville, radio, Broadway and Hollywood, where his hits included the lyrics for Marlene Dietrich's ""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have"".
His ""The Most Happy Fella"", a musical with a startling score that fused opera, operetta and West 45th Street, was revived last summer in a musically-rich version by the New York City Opera. Another admired production, employing two pianos in place of an orchestra, is currently playing across the street from its original Broadway home, presumably with a dispensation from the musicians' union.
Jo Sullivan Loesser, the original star of ""The Most Happy Fella"" and the composer's widow, has reason to be pleased by the revival business. The current staging of ""Guys and Dolls"" cost a comparatively modest $5-1/4m and is expected to move into profit soon. There are plans for a London presentation of Loesser's ""Where's Charley?"", an American and perhaps a European tour of ""Guys and Dolls"", and a possible Broadway revival of ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"", a hit of the Kennedy years and Loesser's other triumph with the ""Guys"" librettist, Abe Burrows. Even lesser Loesser, like ""Pleasures and Palaces"", which never quite made it to Broadway, and ""Greenwillow"" may resurface in concert.
Mrs Loesser offers a simple but accurate explanation for the sudden Loesser explosion: ""When something like ""Guys and Dolls"" is so good, people want to see more [of Loesser's work]."" But equally brilliant new American musicals ought to be playing alongside the old. Today's prospective librettists and composers would do well to study the brilliance and jollity of the antique Broadway baubles that producers are polishing up for public display."

Across those dotted lines on the globe, winds blow, rivers flow and migrating species walk or fly. The dotted lines may carve up the earth, but the sea and the atmosphere remain open to all, to cherish or plunder. When people in one country harm that bit of the environment they assume to be theirs, many others may suffer, too. But how, and how much, can countries make their neighbours change their ways? That is the theme of this survey.
Such problems pose new issues for diplomats and economists. Reaching agreement often means resolving conflicting goals and priorities. Even among countries of similar wealth, environmental goals may differ: think of the rows with Iceland and Japan over whaling, or the reluctance of Britain to curb sulphur dioxide from power stations. But cross-border arguments are harder to resolve when many countries are involved, and especially when those countries have widely differing living standards and environmental priorities. Particularly intractable are the two main subjects on the agenda at next month's meeting of the United Nations Commission on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro: biological diversity and climate change.
That countries have different environmental goals is not surprising: a policy that brings large benefits to one country at little cost may have the opposite effect on another. But from such differences, many problems arise. Trade is inextricably affected. Tough green standards for products may keep out goods from countries that cannot meet them; tough rules to reduce the environmental impacts of production processes will make some companies less competitive than their rivals in laxer nations. Where such differences influence only the local environment, complaints may be muted. But where they cross borders, or affect the common heritage, environmentalists may demand that all countries meet common goals.
That embroils trade in other ways. Trade may be the mechanism by which environmental damage is perceived to cross borders, as in the case of toxic waste or the export of endangered species. It is also one of the few weapons governments can use to bully others into changing their behaviour. When one country feels that the environmental actions of another are harming its own people, it may see trade as a reasonable way to retaliate. Trade sanctions may also be used to provided some added glue for the fragile structure of international environmental agreements.
ONE EARTH
International agreement is the best way to solve environmental problems that transcend national borders. These are of three main kinds. First, neighbouring countries may share part of the environment: a river such as the Rhine or the Jordan, a stretch of water such as the Mediterranean or the Great Lakes. Regional problems--acid rain is one example--fall into this category. Second, some environmental resources, such as the atmosphere, the oceans and Antarctica, are shared by the whole planet. The build-up of climate-changing greenhouse gases, the thinning of the ozone layer and the killing of whales fall into this group. Lastly, some environmental assets clearly belong to individual countries, but their future may affect others, in either material or (more often) spiritual and emotional ways. The disappearance of coral reefs or elephants may not show up as more than a microscopic blip on gross world product, but it gives people in many countries a sense of loss.
To tackle problems like these, countries increasingly sign treaties. Two multilateral environmental treaties came into force in the United States between 1940 and 1959; ten between 1960 and 1979; 11 in the 1980s alone. Like all international treaties, those on the environment can be enforced only by the governments that abide by them.
The market is unlikely to help. Even in an individual country it will rarely deliver what is best for the environment. The costs to individuals and companies of polluting or pillaging the environment will be lower than the costs their activities impose on the rest of society. National environmental policies therefore need government to step in and ensure that polluters carry the costs they would otherwise dump on their fellow citizens.
Without a world government, no institution can compel international polluters to pay. True, there has been a rapid growth of institutions that aim to set international environmental priorities or persuade governments to reach (and abide by) agreements on environmental goals. But such institutions are no stronger than the governments that set them up. Agreement can therefore be based only on the belief that acting together brings more benefits than acting alone.
That belief will frequently be true. If one of the countries living round a polluted lake tries to clean the water by acting alone, it may make heroic efforts but achieve little. If all act together, modest steps may achieve much. If, say, Norway stopped all output of carbon dioxide next week, it would take only 46m tonnes out of the atmosphere. The same amount could equally be saved if every country in the world cut its output of carbon dioxide by 0.22%.
Conversely, if all but one of those lakeside countries reduces the muck it discharges into the water, that one country will still enjoy the improvement in water quality that the actions of its neighbours deliver. An individual country can generally do best of all by dropping out of a pact, as long as it cannot be excluded from the resulting gains. It can thus enjoy the rewards of travelling on the global bus without paying its fare, as a ""free rider"". This is the central paradox of international environmental agreements. All countries do better by co-operating than by acting alone; but individual countries often have a powerful incentive not to co-operate.
Countries are more likely to succumb to the temptation to hitch a free ride the more the costs of belonging to an international agreement diverge from the benefits it brings; or the longer the gap between the pain and the gain. The balance of costs and benefits will usually vary from one country to another. It will be partly a function of the number of countries involved. If only three countries live around that dirty lake, the gains that each enjoys from ending pollution will be much larger than if only two clean up. A completely clean lake is much nicer than a two-thirds clean lake. But if a dozen countries are involved, the difference made by the participation of one extra country will be small. The costs of participation to each country are the same, but the gains from co-operating are lower.
How can recalcitrant countries be brought on board? Either the costs of participation can be reduced, or its benefits can be increased. One option is to set targets that reflect the differing costs to individual countries of meeting them. International agreements frequently set uniform goals for each country: output of this gas or catches of that fish must be restricted to such-and-such a level over a set period of years. A well-designed agreement will try to ensure that the largest changes are made by those countries that find them least expensive.
Targets, however distributed, are more likely to be honoured if countries can agree on some way to verify them. That may not be easy. The Verification Technology Information Centre, a London-based body that usually thinks about arms agreements, has argued that it would be harder to reach a climate agreement that does not provide for verification than one that does. In fact, provisions for verification in the initial climate treaty that will be signed next month are even vaguer than the commitments signatories undertake. Verification is essential to build confidence, foster mutual trust, and encourage uncommitted nations to join. Industrial countries are slowly becoming more willing to go a step further and accept international inspection of their performance. The OECD has recently begun an inspection of Germany's environmental policies, as the first step in a programme that will eventually cover all its members.
Another way to reduce the costs of participation is for some governments to bribe others. The countries that gain most from an agreement may reward those for whom the costs are heaviest. The Montreal protocol on ozone-depleting substances (mainly chlorofluorocarbons or CFCS) includes a fund for such payments. Under the new climate treaty, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) will pay developing countries for the extra costs of policies to slow global warming. Such payments are easily (and wrongly) confused with international aid; they are really imports of environmental services. They raise large practical problems. How, for instance, can the world be sure that it is not paying a country to do something it would have done in any case? And how can a country be rewarded for introducing market based incentives (higher energy prices, for instance), rather than making a one-off investment (in energy-efficient light bulbs, say)?
THE PROBLEM OF PUNISHMENT
The alternative to bribery is bullying. This may simply take the form of international disapproval. Nobody likes being a pariah. Britain eventually agreed to stop dumping sewage sludge in the North Sea mainly because of the political costs of being dubbed ""the dirty man of Europe"". America has been under similar pressure to stabilise its output of global-warming gases. A peculiarity of international environmental agreements is the involvement of non-governmental organisations. It is hard to imagine anti-nuclear campaigners playing a constructive role in disarmament talks, but green lobbyists are active participants in many environmental negotiations. As they are deft at mobilising popular protest, they also play a big part in encouraging governments to keep their promises.
But beyond protest, the options for punishment are few. A handful of examples exist of countries taking on binding commitments. That is likely only if governments are locked together by forces other than the environmental issue at stake. Within the EC, for example, the European Court can oblige a country to implement an environmental directive. Moreover, the Maastricht treaty on European union greatly extends the areas on which environmental policy decisions need only qualified-majority voting rather than unanimity.
Ultimately, trade sanctions are the most tempting weapon. A growing number of agreements include provision for trade sanctions to punish freeriders. The danger is that the costs of such penalties may exceed their benefits: the costs of lost trade may be greater than the environmental gains from wider compliance.
Where polluters are poor and those on the receiving end wealthy, the threat of such sanctions also has unpleasant overtones. The poor--whether they be South American countries destroying their rain forests or East Europeans burning soft coal in their power stations--may feel that their environmental priorities are being dictated by other countries. They may wish to concentrate on environmental risks to the lives and prosperity of their own citizens. They may feel, with some reason, that the rich countries are using their political and commercial muscle to impose their own green agenda.
This survey argues that the rich countries need to be sensitive to charges of ""eco-colonialism"" if they want to make the world a greener place. They need to be careful about using trade as a weapon to get their way and need to explore new kinds of financial transfers and aid. Developing countries that pursue environmental goals which go beyond their national interests can reasonably expect the developed countries to find ways to compensate them for doing so. Only by finding new kinds of bargains and new institutions to strike them can the interest of each country in its neighbour's environment be expressed in ways that do not threaten trade or national sovereignty.
THE FREEDOM TO BE DIRTIER THAN THE REST
""Just between you and me,"" mused Lawrence Summers, chief economist of the World Bank, in a memo leaked to The Economist in February, ""shouldn't the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the LDCs?""
Mr Summers gave three reasons for his controversial proposition. First, the costs of pollution depend on earnings lost through death and injury. These earnings are lowest in the poorest countries. Therefore, ""I think the logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that."" Second, the costs of pollution rise disproportionately as it grows, so polluting the cleanest parts of the world may be less harmful than making the dirty parts still filthier. Third, people value a clean environment more as their incomes rise. So if polluting industries move from rich countries to poor ones, the costs of pollution will decline.
The tone is grating. The idea that life is worth less in poor countries than rich is a curious one for a World Bank official to promote. But the issues raised in the memo are central: how far ought countries to pursue different environmental standards? The answer has a direct impact on industry and on international trade. For differing green standards may be a powerful tool of protectionism, or may give some countries a cost advantage over competitors subject to tougher regulation. The effect is occasionally to create an alliance between environmentalists and industry, both arguing that other countries should abide by the same environmental standards as their own.
That national environmental priorities differ is inevitable. As the chart on the next page shows, some kinds of pollution rise steeply in the first stages of development, then die away as countries grow richer. In poor countries filthy water, untreated sewage, soot and dust from coal-burning, lead in city air and soil erosion still damage the health and wealth of millions of people. Tackling these problems must be the main environmental goals. But they may not be the goals that the rich countries most want the poor to pursue.
The rich countries also tend to give priority at home to those environmental problems that harm health and wealth. But the pollution that is now growing as a result of affluence--smog-causing chemicals from cars, municipal waste and global-warming carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas--is much less life-threatening. Having brought their most acute environmental problems under control, the industrial countries have increasingly turned their attention to those that cross international boundaries.
Different priorities make sense for other reasons. A country may deliberately decide to pay less attention to protecting its own environment than to other investments. When faced with a choice between cleaner air and less poverty, many poor countries will rightly accept more pollution than a rich country would, in exchange for more economic growth. If a developing country has the choice between (a) investing in scrubbers on power stations to prevent acid rain and (b) building hospitals, it will build hospitals first. And it will make more sense to persuade local industry to dump its toxic waste with reasonable safety than to persuade it to treat the stuff to American levels.
Even when countries are at the same stage of development, environmental standards should not necessarily be identical. There are relevant differences in the way the receiving environment reacts to pollution. An oil spill in the stormy North Sea does less lasting damage than a spill off the almost tideless Mediterranean coast; contaminated land matters less when it is far from homes and reservoirs.
A GREENER PLAYING FIELD
Are differing national environmental standards in the interests of companies? Michael Porter, Harvard Business School's guru of international competitiveness, argues that well-designed regulations can foster technological advance and restrain the cost of meeting green goals. In his view, a country may gain competitive advantage by raising, not lowering, its environmental standards, because others will eventually follow. He argues that environmental regulations, judiciously applied in Japan and Germany, have allowed those countries to dominate world markets for pollution-control equipment.
But the use of environmental regulation to force the pace of technological change is easily blurred with restraints on trade. Indeed, some protectionism may be inescapable in environmental policy. After all, the purpose of national regulations or economic instruments is to exclude products and producers that do not meet certain minimum standards. The effect is generally to restrict the national market to companies that can meet those standards, increasing their profits in ways that help to offset the extra costs that environmental measures entail. That effect, which provides companies with an incentive to meet tougher environmental goals, will be diluted if importers are exempted.
Environmental standards for products have the same effects as other product standards: they make trade a bit more complicated and arduous. For example, last year Germany passed legislation requiring companies to take back and recycle most of their packaging. Officials argued that there was nothing discriminatory about this: the obligation applied equally to German and to foreign firms (or rather, to their German distributors). But the impact is certainly likely to disrupt trade. Now the German government is considering legislation to require the car industry to take back and recycle its products at the ends of their lives. German car companies have for some years been devising recycling techniques. An obligation to retrieve and recycle cars would be easier for German manufacturers to meet than for foreign competitors.
Germany's take-back legislation is part of a trend in a number of European countries to reduce solid waste by making companies take responsibility for the final fate of their products. This will disrupt trade, if only because foreign companies are worse placed to retrieve their wares. Plenty of other environmental product standards also make trade more difficult, such as different national schemes of eco-labelling, or mandatory deposit schemes on products such as drinks bottles, or bans on certain materials such as plastics.
Differences in standards cause special headaches for the European Community (EC). They conflict with the principles of the internal market, in which each country's standards are accepted by others. But a landmark decision by the European Court in 1988 opened a loophole through which most of these measures have elbowed their way. The Court decided, against the wishes of the Commission in Brussels, to allow Denmark to insist on returnable drinks bottles. The implication was that, in certain circumstances, national environmental policy should take precedence over the mutual recognition of standards.
Higher product standards are allowed; lower process standards are frowned on. Much EC environmental legislation has been driven by a desire to stop some countries gaining competitive advantage by being dirtier than others. For example, in 1988 the EC agreed to the Large Combustion Plant directive, so that power stations had to take expensive steps to reduce their output of the gases that contribute to acid rain. Europe had already reached a (more modest) agreement to tackle cross-border air pollution, in the more logical forum of the Economic Commission for Europe, which brought together the eastern and western ends of the continent. Acid rain does not stop at the EC'S boundaries, so why did the EC reach such an agreement? Mainly because Germany, driven by its noisy Green parties and by ghoulish descriptions of dying trees, had passed a law in 1983 requiring its coal-fired power stations to fit expensive flue-gas desulphurisation equipment or shut down. German companies grumbled that the law would raise electricity prices; the German government responded by brow-beating its EC partners into adopting much the same provisions.
Many environmentalists wish the GATT was a similar one-way street. But the GATT, unlike the EC, is concerned not with harmonising standards but with freeing trade. One of its basic principles is non-discrimination. That means that a country can impose whatever environmental rules or taxes it likes on imports or exports, as long as it does the same to its own products. But it cannot, except in extremely limited circumstances, impose rules on the processes used by foreign producers.
That constraint brings grumbles from both industry and environmentalists. As environmental controls on production processes grow tighter, producers will threaten to move to other countries where the controls are lighter. The costs of such controls inevitably affect price competitiveness, although usually by tiny amounts. In some industries, though, environmental regulations may impose large burdens. In these, industries may actually move rather than face a handicap in the export market.
Sometimes, companies decide to turn their backs on the cost advantages they might enjoy by producing in dirty countries. In the aftermath of the Bhopal disaster at a subsidiary of Union Carbide in India, a growing number of American chemical plants have made it company policy to apply the same rules worldwide. A recent study* found several examples of companies going out of their way to pursue higher standards than required in poor countries. For instance, IBM's subsidiary in Argentina has been unable to find a local disposal site for hazardous waste that meets company standards; so it recycles three-quarters of the waste it generates. Chevron uses only water-based lubricating fluids in its drilling operations in Nigeria, rather than oil-based ones used in the United States, because Nigeria has no facilities for hazardous-waste disposal. Admirable though such policies are, they defeat their objects if the result is that some overseas investment does not take place and is supplanted by local investment that meets lower standards.
More often, differences in environmental production standards will make industry moan about lost competitiveness. In the United States, where the costs of environmental policies are expected to rise sharply in the 1990s, this will lead to pressures of two kinds. First, legislators will toy with plans to impose special duties on imports produced under standards that are less strict than those in the United States. One such proposal was introduced into the Senate last year. Even if it had passed, it would not have helped companies which grumble that tough environmental standards handicap them in third markets. So a second approach has been to water down some green obligations. The Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Dan Quayle, has helped to block a number of proposals, including a scheme to require recycling of municipal waste.
Negotiations on a North American Free Trade Area between the United States and Mexico have shown how easily greens can end up on the same side as protectionists. Environmentalists, worried that freeing trade would lead to a weakening of standards, teamed up with companies and trade unionists worried that jobs would walk south to benefit from lower environmental costs. The result was a set of unprecedented concessions to green lobbyists. Last year American trade representatives promised to put environmentalists on their advisory committee and to conduct a review of the environmental impacts of the trade agreement. A senior official from the Environmental Protection Agency sits in whenever green issues are being negotiated, and the government has said that no American standards will be dropped to let in Mexican products.
As poor countries grow richer--and trade is a powerful source of wealth--their own environmental standards will rise. Most of their citizens will not welcome the idea that their competitive advantage should come from harming their own environment. But there will still be occasions when differing environmental priorities induce countries to threaten each other with trade sanctions--and to that we now turn.
* ""Managing the Global Environmental Challenge"". By Business International, with Arthur D Little
GATTERY V GREENERY
Differences in national environmental standards make industrialists grumble. But they also annoy environmentalists. Increasingly, trade measures are being used by countries or groups of countries to try to influence what happens beyond their own jurisdictions. This poses problems for GATT.
Many of these problems emerge from the most purely ""environmental"" dispute to come before a GATT arbitration panel: a row between the United States and Mexico over catches of dolphins by tuna-fishers. Its outcome makes clear the tight limits under the GATT to putting the environment before the basic rules of non-discrimination in trade. It is this case that has made GATT a four-letter word to fundamentalist greens. It will not be the last such dispute. Increasingly, environmentalists, especially in the United States, want to use trade sanctions to apply a little unilateral arm-twisting.
Yellow-fin tuna, which swim in the eastern tropical Pacific, congregate under shoals of dolphins. Tuna fishermen therefore round up the dolphins and trap them, along with the tuna, in purse-shaped nets. Americans not only have the world's largest market for tuna; they also have tender hearts, and are devoted to a tame dolphin called Flipper. The Marine Mammals Protection Act (MMPA) insists that imports of tuna from countries fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific will not be allowed unless that country has a programme to stop dolphin slaughter at least as tough as America's; and unless the average number of dolphins they kill is no more than 114 times that of American tuna-fishing vessels.
Easily the largest tuna-fishing fleet in the eastern tropical Pacific is that of Mexico. The American administration, well aware that the provisions of the MMPA conflicted with GATT's rules, has been unsurprisingly reluctant to implement them against Mexico. So the Earth Island Institute, a Californian lobbying group, took the government to court. In February last year the administration was compelled to impose an embargo on tuna imports from Mexico, Venezuela and Vanuatu. Mexico complained to GATT, with predictable results.
Worse is to come. The MMPA also lays down that other nations which have imported tuna from the offending country must be subject to the embargo as well. The aim is to prevent ""tuna laundering"". In October 1990 the Earth Island Institute found that a large American cannery in Thailand which claimed to be selling ""dolphin-friendly"" tuna, was in fact importing fish that had been caught in decidedly unfriendly ways. In February this year the institute secured a further judgment requiring the administration to ban tuna imports from Thailand, Japan and the EC. Nobody has yet appealed to GATT.
In its ruling on the tuna-dolphin case, a GATT disputes panel argued that the GATT's nondiscrimination principle meant that the treatment of imports and domestic products should be compared, not production regulations that had no effect on the product as such. In theory, one of two possible exceptions might apply. Both fall under Article XX of the GATT, which allows a number of exemptions to the principles of the organisation, on condition that they do not entail arbitrary discrimination or disguised trade restriction. One of these allows measures to protect animal health or exhaustible natural resources (the word ""environment"" does not appear in the GATT's articles). But this exemption applies, said the panel, only when such resources lie within a country's own jurisdiction. The dolphins of the eastern tropical Pacific were clearly beyond America's reach.
Nor did a second possible exception apply. To do so, the tuna embargo would have to be shown to be aimed primarily at conservation, and to be the only course open to the United States. Neither point held: for one thing, Mexican fishermen could not know the limits to a year's dolphin catch in advance, because it depended on calculating retrospectively 125% of America's own catch that year for another, the United States had failed to try to negotiate a treaty on preserving dolphins. The restriction therefore smacked more of trade protection than dolphin conservation.
The panel did allow another American law which requires that, if tuna products are labelled ""dolphin friendly"", they must meet certain dolphin-protection standards. The panel ruled that such labelling met GATT rules, because it was designed to prevent fraudulent advertising, whether of imported or domestically produced goods.
American law is likely to confront the GATT with an increasing number of cases like the tuna-dolphin one, to the embarrassment of the administration. The Earth Island Institute is already back in court, demanding an embargo on imports from French Guyana of shrimps caught in ways that also trap rare turtles. A yet more extreme use of trade sanctions is undoubtedly beyond GATT's rules. Angered by Japan's refusal to stop importing the shells of hawksbill sea turtles, which are on an internationally agreed list of endangered species that cannot be traded, the United States threatened to ban imports from Japan of pearls and all animal products, including more than $300m of fish. Japan agreed to ban imports of turtle shells by the end of this year.
That story might be repeated if whaling is resumed. The International Whaling Convention meets in Glasgow in June to discuss that possibility, but Iceland has already resigned, declaring its intention to resume whaling. Refusing to import whale meat is obviously not an option open to the United States, because it does not buy the stuff anyway. But under American law the government is obliged to prohibit imports of all fish products from any state whose activities diminish the effectiveness of the IWC'S conservation measures. That provision has already been used against Japan in retaliation for its objection to the IWC decision to halt commercial whaling in 1986.
ALL TOGETHER
Trade sanctions by individual countries will generally break the GATT's rules. But several multilateral environmental agreements--17 of 127 examined by GATT--contain trade provisions. Only in two--the Basle convention on trade in hazardous waste and the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which bans trade in African elephants and a large number of other animals and species--are controls on trade central to the treaty. The Montreal protocol also raises awkward issues for GATT.
Trade controls are crucial to the Basle convention: after all, while airborne pollution blows across borders and contaminated water flows, solid waste can cross from one country to another only if somebody ships it. Under the convention, which acquired enough signatures to come into force at the beginning of May, movements of hazardous waste between parties and non-parties must stop, unless countries have a bilateral agreement that meets the terms of Basle.
The main practical problem has been to define the wastes Basle covers. This is difficult with wastes sent abroad for final disposal; it is even harder with the much larger amounts of waste that are sent abroad for recovery--in other words, to have something useful extracted from them. These wastes are by definition the raw material for another process, so stopping trade in them between parties and non-parties interrupts trade much more severely than preventing a few drums of something nasty being dumped across national borders. But if recovery wastes are regulated more lightly, the effect could be to open a loophole for drum-dumping.
The Basle convention poses special problems for the EC. In theory, the Community can sign the treaty only as a single unit; to do so, it needs first to operate as a single market for wastes. That implies that each country accepts the standards operating in every other member. But each country has its own list of substances it regards as hazardous, and most are reluctant to remove anything from the list. This can cause anomalies: Germany, for instance, treats molasses as hazardous, because unscrupulous companies were pouring the stuff down drains, and listing it gave the authorities some control.
Even with the Basle convention in place, governments still worry that hazardous waste can be sent by rich countries to poor ones which cannot treat it. African countries have signed a treaty of their own, the Bamako conventio  agreeing not to import any hazardous waste. Some countries wonder whether to copy Austria  where law requires an exporter to """"know"""" that exported wastes will be handled as they would be domestically. But how is such knowledge to be acquired? Countries determined to import hazardous waste that they cannot treat are unlikely to invite inspectors to visit their non-existent facilities. With CITES  the issue is rather different. GATT rules do not prevent governments from banning the domestic sale of a product and enforcing the ban at their borders  as long as the ban does not discriminate on grounds of origin. A selective ban is always possible if the exporting country has agreed--as most potential ivory-exporters have done in the case of the CITES ban on ivory trade. But if an exporter decides to sell  an import ban might fall foul of the GATT'S rules. The Montreal protocol contains a provision that may be the shape of treaties to come. It bans imports from non-signatories of CFCS and products containing them. More ominously  one clause commits signatories to """"determine the feasibility of banning or restricting  from states not party to this protocol  but not containing  controlled substances."""" Consultations with GATT on the trade provisions in the Montreal protocol led to some amendments  although it is not clear how far GATT officials agreed and how far they merely acquiesced in the treaty's phrasing. All three conventions break the GATT'S rule that no country must treat one trading partner worse than another  by imposing more restrictive trade provisions on non-signatories than apply to signatories. Sometimes  the GATT secretariat points out  countries could have set national quotas on their consumption of CFCS from any source  rather than threatening to ban CFC imports from non-signatories. But a general problem remains. If international environmental treaties use trade measures as disincentives to free-riding  then those measures will inevitably be selective restrictions on imports. Moreover  such restrictions will generally apply to imports of goods produced by processes that the treaty aims to restrict. Both points will conflict with the GATT'S rules. GETTING AT THE GATT So far  no country has complained to the GATT about its treatment under an international environmental agreement. Clearly  the more countries sign up to an agreement Environmentalists  who typically assume the GATT to be a free-standing international organisation like the World Bank rather than a stop-gap treaty  have begun to clamour for its reform. They want a clarification of the extent to which trade liberalisation should take precedence over environmental goals  and has revived a moribund committee to look at the implications for trade of a number of green issues. A difficulty with this debate is that the main protagonists speak quite different languages. The culture clash between trade experts and environmentalists is striking. When meetings of government officials are held at the OECD  the international body that first began to examine the potential for a clash between the environment and trade  the old national alliances tend to disappear. Instead  while the environmental bureaucrats talk shop at the other. The contrast between trade officials and non-governmental green groups is even more acute. Gary Stanley  a Washington-based environmental lawyer  contrasts the trade lobby  which is """"comfortable with closed diplomatic negotiations and has well-articulated views and a desire to quantify issues and therefore a preference for tariffs over quotas""""  with the environmentalists who combine """"distrust of governments with less well-articulated views and a dislike of quantifying."""" Both sides  he thinks  share one characteristic: they are idealistic and reluctant to compromise. Yet compromise is essential if the environment is not to become a fashionable excuse for greater protectionism. As yet  the effect of green issues on international trade is probably not large  and more discussed than actual. But if economic growth is slow and governments become increasingly protectionist  they will inevitably include clauses on trade. It may well be that the present stance of the GATT shows a lack of economic logic. David Pearce a British environmental economist  argues that  from the point of view of the importing country  as when acid rain drifts across a border or when CFCS damage the ozone layer. But the importer may also suffer when an exporter chops down its rain forest or wipes out its rhinos. However  as Mr Pearce admits  it would be formidably difficult in practice to allow exceptions for such """"production externalities"""". The reason is clear from the ruling of the disputes panel in the tuna-dolphin case. Allow one country to discriminate against one production process on environmental grounds and the result is a whale-sized loophole. GATT rules set no bounds on such exemptions once they are allowed. Where would discrimination stop? Should exemptions be allowed only when the importing country is directly affected by the environmental policies of the exporter--as the waterways of Texas and California are polluted by fly-by-night Mexican companies across the border? Should they be allowed when the environmental harm occurs on no-man's land: in the deep oceans (as in the dolphin case) or in the atmosphere? Which products should be banned? What happens if the country imposing the sanctions does not import the offending product? For instance  acid rain arises when electricity is generated  but electricity is rarely traded. Would everything whose manufacture involved the use of electricity in an offending country therefore be at risk? That question may sound ludicrous  levied on CFCS in America  applies to imports as well--including those that use CFCS in the manufacturing process. This is proving  as a recent OECD report pointed out  extremely effective in persuading South-East Asian makers of semiconductor chips to find alternatives to CFCS for cleaning their product. The market for semiconductor chips is highly price-sensitive and one where protectionism is tempting. Would the American tax pass a GATT panel? Probably not: when America's Environmental Protection Agency tried to design a tuna tax to replace the tuna embargo  it found it impossible to fulfil the GATT'S rules. The tuna-dolphin disputes panel argued that  if the governments that belonged to GATT wanted to make it possible to discriminate against imports on the grounds of the environmental standards applied in their production  the contracting parties to GATT should draft a new rule  pressed by the United States  may eventually take up that suggestion. Devising a proper boundary will not be easy. Clearly the treaty should not condone the use of general trade sanctions by one government to bully another to adopt a particular environmental policy. It should certainly emphasise the freedom of countries to use labelling to draw consumers' attention to the way in which a product has been produced. But the GATT does need to allow  in carefully restricted circumstances  trade measures that are taken under international environmental agreements. Indeed  it nearly did so. Ian Fletcher of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry points out that Article XX of the charter began life as article 45 of the Havana charter which was to have set up the International Trade Organisation as the third cornerstone of the reconstructed post war economy  alongside the World Bank and the IMF. That charter  contained an additional exception  covering measures """"taken in pursuance of any intergovernmental agreement which relates solely to the conservation of fisheries resources  migratory birds or wild animals..."""" GATT now needs a clause of that sort. BIRDS AND BEES The best way to protect wildlife is by international agreement rather than unilateral trade embargos. Wildlife protection was  indeed  the goal of some of the earliest environmental treaties. The species that 19th-century diplomats negotiated about  though  were those with a commercial value: fish  vicuna and (to name a 1902 European convention) """"Birds Useful to Agriculture"""". Only in the past 30 years has there been a growth in conservation for its own sake  and in the protection of habitats  rather than of individual species. The intention at Rio is to sign a treaty to cap all wildlife treaties: a convention on """"biodiversity"""". That is eco-jargon for biological diversity  covering everything from beetles to baboons. Small wonder it has proved so difficult to construct. The early wildlife treaties tended to cover creatures that are found outside the jurisdiction of one country  such as whales  or that move from place to place  treaties are likely to reflect the fact that the ways countries with lots of animals and plants treat their natural heritage is of interest to people in other parts of the globe. A recurrent theme in wildlife treaties (admirably analysed in a book* by Simon Lyster  who now works for the WorldWide Fund for Nature) is the tension between conservation and regulated exploitation. It is usually simpler to insist on a complete ban on the killing of a particular species than to regulate culling or hunting. But a complete ban may seem unreasonable if a commercially valuable stock of creatures recovers and is no longer in obvious danger of extinction. More important  some culling may often be essential to persuade countries that they will gain by co-operating in conservation. One interesting example of the way limited culling can bind countries into an agreement is the treaty to conserve the fur seal  whose numbers in the north Pacific became dangerously depleted in the late 19th century by """"pelagic sealing""""--killing at sea. Four countries hunted the seals: the United States and Russia (which between them owned all the islands on which the seals breed)  and Japan and Canada (which caught the seals at sea  where most of those taken were females. Under a treaty of 1911  Japan and Britain (on behalf of Canada) agreed to stop pelagic sealing. In exchange  they were guaranteed a share of the seals killed by the other two countries at their island breeding-grounds. The arrangement was a success. Having fallen to about 300  seal numbers recovered to over 2m by the 1950s. The 1911 treaty demonstrated the gains from cooperation: by banding together  the four countries secured the future of a valuable species that might otherwise have died out. It had a clear system of compensation  to win the participation of those countries that would otherwise have lost out. And it showed the case for bringing a natural resource under the management of one country (the owners of the islands) rather than treating it as open to all comers In the case of whales  fishing countries originally got together to protect stocks from over-exploitation. The whaling industry had a long history of boom and bust as the discovery of new whaling techniques and hunting grounds led to the exhaustion of one population after another. Because whales are caught in the deep oceans  an international treaty is the only way to affect their numbers. The early emphasis of the International Whaling Convention (IWC)  was on the orderly development of the whaling industry. But the catastrophic decline of many species and the growth of increasingly vociferous lobbies against all whaling in a number of influential countries have shifted the balance. Commercial whaling was banned in 1986. In June the IWC meets in Glasgow to discuss the possibility of allowing limited commercial whaling to resume. Up to now  much of the argument has been over whether hunting will return some species to the verge of extinction. But as the stocks of some whales have recovered  anti-whalers increasingly argue that whales should not be hunted at all. This """"animal-rights"""" lobby takes the simple view that it is wrong to kill a large  on traditional economic and scientific grounds  that some killing should be permitted  and those who take a purely ethical approach. As ethics is easier to shout about than science  it will probably triumph. YOUR SPECIES  OUR HERITAGE Because a country that wants to protect a species may not control it  it may try various ploys to persuade others to agree. New Zealand law prohibits its citizens from killing whales wherever they are--even if they are in the coastal waters of another state where killing is legal under local law. More common is the use of trade bans  either unilaterally or as part of a treaty. International trade is often what gives an endangered species its commercial value. It may therefore seem logical to destroy that value. The danger is that  in destroying the value of the species For example  Austria and Holland have banned imports of tropical timber produced unsustainably. By depressing the price of timber  such a ban may discourage countries with rain forests from protecting their trees. If timber is valuable  countries will want to ensure that logging licences are properly priced and policed  in order to capture the profits available on world markets from selling a resource that cannot be produced in many other countries. If timber exports are prohibited  the land on which they stand may be cleared to grow something that can more easily be traded--such as beef. Trade restrictions  as this survey has already argued  are central to CITES  but because of the debate over the future of the African elephant. The elephant's numbers collapsed between 1981 and 1989  falling from about 1.2m to just over 600 0 To try to stem this massacre  a decision was taken in October 1989 to transfer the elephant from appendix 11 of CITES  which allows restricted trade in an endangered species and its products  which prohibits all international trade. But five southern African states have persistently demanded that their elephants be returned to appendix 11. They argue that their own elephant populations are stable or rising  and that trade in elephant products is essential to help to pay for their conservation. When the members of CITES met in March this year  the five countries agreed not to reopen the ivory trade  but hoped for a compromise that would allow them to sell elephant hides and meat. They failed to win it. Behind the argument over the elephant's future lies a difference of view on how to make elephants pay. For some countries  notably Kenya  elephants are a mainstay of the tourist trade. These countries have a particular interest in preventing ivory poaching. But protecting elephants is extremely expensive. Zimbabwe reckons that it costs $200 a square kilometre to protect elephants from illegal hunting for a year. Each beast needs about half a square kilometre of good grazing land. To provide an incentive to protect elephants in countries where tourists do not or cannot come to look at them CAN NATURE PAY ITS WAY? Timothy Swanson  of Cambridge University  argues that extinction is often the result not of a policy failure but of a deliberate decision. In a couple of papers for the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment in London  Mr Swanson calculates  the amount of specialised agricultural land in the developing world increased by almost 40%. One marker is the advancing number of tractors: up 29% in Africa in the past decade  82% in South America  128% in Asia--and down 4% in North America. In the developed world  the process of conversion has more or less ended. If a country decides to retain a stretch of habitat in its natural form  that is an investment decision. If it turns a blind eye to logging or poaching  it is deciding not to invest in preservation. Open access to a natural resource is not a random mistake  African countries preserve appearances rather than pachyderms. If poor countries are to have an incentive to conserve their wildlife  it will have to earn them a higher return than alternative uses. That will be increasingly difficult: almost all the huge growth in the world's population (to between 10 billion and 23 billion before it stabilises  thinks the World Bank) will take place in poor countries. Although the growth will take place mainly in cities  though  the increasing demand for farm land will need to be matched by an increasing return from conservation  if countries are to have an incentive to protect habitat. How  then  ought countries that invest in biodiversity to be compensated for doing so? Mr Swanson suggests three ways. First  exported wildlife often brings only a tiny fraction of its worth in rich markets to those who capture or kill it. For instance  parrots from Irian Jaya  exported from Indonesia for $2 each  sell in the United States for $500 wholesale. Such organisations would need the backing of importing countries to ensure that a black market in unsustainably produced wildlife did not develop. The saga of tuna from the eastern tropical Pacific  described earlier in this survey  is testimony to the difficulty of that: Italy and Japan have cheerfully continued to import drift-netted fish  which America's ban has made cheaper. Secondly  unmodified genetic material may turn out to be useful in unpredictable ways. One of the most quoted examples is the rosy periwinkle  a medicinal plant from Madagascar discovered in the early 1960s to be useful in the treatment of several kinds of cancer. Yet no way exists to reward developing countries for preserving their natural gene pool. Indeed  including those in New York and at Kew  in London  now make it a condition of plant research carried out on behalf of large companies that royalties for any commercially useful discoveries are paid to the countries from which the genetic material comes. Earlier this year Merck  Sharp and Dohme  a large pharmaceutical company  agreed to pay Costa Rica a flat """"prospector's fee"""" of $1m  and royalties on any products developed from genetic materials discovered in the country. Lastly  biological diversity offers the world a sort of insurance against the risks that over-bred plants or species will succumb more readily to pests and diseases. Wild strains are periodically bred back into domestic ones to strengthen and protect them. Mr Swanson suggests some sort of international fund to make payments to countries that protect certain natural species or habitats. It would not be difficult to boost conservation spending in the developing countries. As the table shows  the proportion of government spending and national wealth devoted to conservation is surprisingly high in some poor countries  but the absolute sums are tiny compared with spending in the richer nations. Estimates for the World Bank's World Development Report suggest that $1 billion-2 billion of extra direct spending a year could be absorbed in conservation in developing countries  though  is roughly what the United States spends annually on conservation. To work  such spending needs to be sustained. It needs to be treated not as foreign aid or one-off benevolence  but as a perpetual commitment to import environmental services. The prospects are discouraging. The African Elephant Conservation Co-ordinating Group  has drawn up conservanon plans for elephants in 33 African countries. Their total cost would be $480m over five years  of which $300m still has to be found. That is small by foreign-aid standards  but large compared with what voluntary bodies can muster. The World-Wide Fund for Nature  which is spending over $4m this year on elephant-related projects in Africa  argues that the failure of donors to turn agitation into money is regarded by African states with """"bitterness  anger and scepticism"""". If the developed countries cannot muster the money to conserve the African elephant  what hope for other animals? * """"International Wildlife Law"""". Grotius 1985 EVERYBODY'S ATMOSPHERE The governments that  in September 1987  signed the Montreal protocol  which had been found to deplete the ozone layer. The relative ease with which the Montreal protocol was agreed  and the success with which it has so far been implemented  have helped to convince people that it will not be much harder to tackle global warming in the same way. This view is almost certainly wrong. The Montreal protocol has a number of provisions designed to make it work more effectively: developing countries are allowed an easier timetable for phasing out CFCS  and indeed have been permitted some increase in the early years of the protocol. In a pair of innovations  a special fund has been set up to help developing countries adopt replacements for CFCS if they cost more than what is being replaced; and clauses in the agreement urge parties to ensure that the transfer of the best available technology to replace CFCS takes place """"under fair and most favourable conditions"""". It was probably not those innovations  though  that eased the passage of the Montreal protocol. Three other factors mattered more. First  announced in October 1991  that about 3% of the ozone layer had gone from over the United States and other temperate countries  raises the possibility of 12m more cases of skin cancer in the United States over the next half century  as well as losses of agricultural production. It adds to the pressure to phase out CFCS in developed countries. Secondly  CFCS are produced by a small number of companies  most of which also produce at least one of the chemicals being used as substitutes for CFCS. In the United States  the companies that made the chemical saw that they might be sued by people who contracted skin cancer. The substitute chemicals were both more expensive and less widely applicable. A world ban on CFCS was obviously an ideal way to lock up the largest possible market for the substitutes. The main CFC manufacturers have therefore tended to support the protocol. The costs of change fall mainly on users  who are more scattered and have less political clout. Lastly  the existence of substitutes has reduced the costs of change. Where substitutes can be """"dropped in"""" without big changes in technology--as in aerosols--CFCS have been rapidly abandoned. Where no good substitute yet exists  as with air-conditioning in cars The result is to underline a point made by Scott Barrett of the London Business School: the smaller the extra cost to a country of signing up to an international agreement and the greater the benefit  the more likely it is to do so. With climate change  the extra costs will be much larger. WARMING UP That the world's nations have already agreed on a treaty on climate change (to be signed in Rio de Janeiro next month) is extraordinary. It is  after all  less than a decade since global warming was first discussed outside laboratories and only 15 months since negotiations began. The new climate convention goes further than did the Vienna convention the first agreement on CFCS. Yet in a number of ways Although there are good grounds for believing that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will warm the planet  there is much less certainty about the pattern which that warming will take  let alone its impact. Scientists are unsure about the extent to which warming will be offset or reinforced  or whether and where droughts and rainfall will increase. It seems unlikely that all the effects of global warming will be harmful  but it is as yet impossible to predict which countries may gain  which lose  and how. Not only is the damage inflicted by climate change difficult to predict; insofar as it can be discerned  it is of a kind that frightens the rich countries less than the prospect of a thinner ozone layer. Nobody has yet found a way of linking climate change to skin cancer (although some have tried to argue that hotter weather will bring malaria to New York). It is not easy to see how gradual climate change can have much observable impact on human health. It may impose economic costs  mainly in the form of lost farm output and the need to build sea walls around low-lying towns. But agriculture is a small part of output in the rich countries Two studies for the United States have had a stab at estimating the total costs of adapting to climate change induced by the equivalent of doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They produce a figure of about 1% of GDP. One of them  conducted for the OECD by William Cline  suggests that over the next 250 years  which are lower in the third world than the first. These figures do not allow for the possibility of nasty surprises such as  say  a shift in the pattern of ocean currents or a sudden rise in sea level caused by the melting of polar ice. The rash of new discoveries about the extent of ozone depletion is a reminder of the difficulty of predicting a wayward atmosphere. Nor do they include the incidental environmental benefits that might flow from reducing the output of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Rough estimates for Norway and Britain by David Pearce indicate that the """"secondary benefits"""" of suppressing some of the other pollutants given off by burning fossil fuels might be much larger than the immediate gains from reducing carbon-dioxide output. However Over the next half century  the damage caused by global warming may be quite modest. Over the much longer term  it may be greater  or it can wait until it happens and then adapt. The balance between these courses will depend on how the costs of action compare with the costs of wait-and-see. Rather more economists have tried to quantify the costs of action than the benefits of avoided damage. Most estimates fall within a range of 1-3% of gross domestic product. Projections that run so far into the future must be treated cautiously. A tiny change in assumptions can have an enormous cumulative effect. But the most striking feature of the estimates is their similarity. This impression is backed up by work* at the OECD  which concludes that stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide in the OECD countries by the year 2000 at 1990 levels might entail an average loss of real income of 0.6% over the period 1995-2050 compared with no policy change. Such costs are not wildly out of line with the benefits that might be expected if everybody else stabilised. But there's the rub. By the middle of the next century  calculates the OECD  stabilisation by its members at current levels would reduce world output of carbon dioxide by 11% from the level it would otherwise have reached. But unless the developing countries could be persuaded to follow their output would swamp that achievement. On some estimates Yet persuading the non-OECD countries to curb their carbon-dioxide output will be much harder than the task that has dominated the run-up to Rio: that of bringing the United States aboard. The OECD paper estimates that the average loss of real income to the non-OECD countries of stabilising their output of carbon dioxide would be almost 5% in 1995-2050. In fact  developing countries also have plenty of scope for free lunches. Their electricity prices are  on average  many developing countries would be better off economically and environmentally if they priced fuel at rich-country levels. Such free lunches are far and away the best hope for reducing the growth of carbon-dioxide output over the next half century. (Strikingly  last year was the first in industrial times when the world's carbon-dioxide output actually fell--thanks to the collapse of industry and rise in energy prices in Eastern Europe.) The OECD estimates that  if non-OECD countries removed all energy subsidies over the next decade  as the table shows  removing distortions in energy taxes delivers cuts in emissions as well as faster economic growth. No other strategy offers these double benefits. Another group of countries likely to be unenthusiastic about reducing carbon-dioxide output is the big energy producers. With CFCS  it was relatively easy to win the agreement of producer countries accounting for two-thirds of emissions. With carbon dioxide  it will be much harder. Two-thirds of the world's coal reserves (the most carbon-rich fuel) are split between the United States Will it? A strong temptation for some countries will be to cheat. If developed countries reduce their use of fossil fuels  energy intensive industries will flourish in countries which benefit from a lower world-market energy price. Just possibly  the overall eflect might be to leave world output of carbon dioxide higher than it would have been without an agreement  the more countries abide by an agreement. The need to avoid the danger is one more reason for an agreement to work as efficiently as possible. * """"The Cost of Reducing CO2 Emissions: Evidence from GREEN"""". By Jean-Marc Burniaux  John Martin  Giuseppe Nicoletti and Joaquim Oliveira Martins. Economics Department Working Paper forthcoming. TOWARDS AGREEMENT The climate convention that will be signed at Rio is only a first step. To put flesh on its few bones  countries will need to take some difficult decisions over the next few years. In particular  the costs of implementing the agreement and the way those costs are shared will be greatly affected by the way the targets are defined and the mechanisms for allowing payments between countries. That in turn will determine how likely countries are to make commitments and then abide by them. All the OECD countries except the United States and Turkey have had targets for their output of carbon dioxide for some time  although some have promised simply to help meet the EC'S group target without agreeing on their share. Not all have quite grasped what their chosen target implies. Some of the most senior civil servants in Britain's Department of the Environment have only recently realised that """"stabilisation by 2005"""" does not imply business-as-usual in 2006. The Norwegians  one of the first countries to set a target  declaring (quite rightly) that it is economically inefficient. The EC  having agreed an overall target  has failed to agree on how to share it out; much hope is pinned on the scope for energy efficiency in eastern Germany. The United States has infuriated its industrial partners by refusing to copy them; given that a target would be legally binding on the administration  in a way that is not true in other OECD countries  this caution is understandable. America's recent experience suggests that some modest target could be reached  if it were carefully chosen: as the chart shows  emissions per head are roughly where they were in the late 1970s. As the Norwegians have realised  flat targets are indeed inefficient. They are the international equivalent of command-and-control measures in domestic environmental policy: they inflict the same reduction in emissions on high-cost and low-cost producers alike. that is likely to be vastly more expensive than concentrating reductions in those countries that can make them most cheaply. Rough calculations for the EC by Mr Barrett suggest that the most cost-effective distribution of reductions might be 50 times less expensive for the EC than achieving the same goal by stabilising emissions from each member country individually. How else might targets be distributed? As the chart on the next page shows  national outputs of carbon dioxide differ  depending on whether they are expressed relative to population or to wealth. Plenty of elaborate schemes for sharing have been put forward. Each has different implications. Some involve targets in terms of the global-warming potential of all greenhouse gases rather than just carbon dioxide--logical  as well as carbon sources: logical  too  given that planting trees may be cheaper than some abatement measures. But how to ensure that the trees are replanted when they cease to grow? Some people take as a ceiling a doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from pre-industrial times. They then propose sharing out rights to that """"stock"""" of atmosphere in various ways. Equity might urge that rights be allocated on the basis of population  on the grounds that every person should have an equal right to the carbon-dioxide absorbing capacity of the atmosphere. On that basis  the developed countries would already have exhausted all their rights and be into deficit. Pragmatism might suggest that rights be shared out on the basis of income. That would leave every group of countries with some scope for further emissions Such exercises make it abundantly clear that no distribution of targets will be both fair and efficient (in the sense of ensuring that emissions are reduced where it is cheapest to do so). The more the initial allocation of targets is shaped by a desire for fairness  the more important it will be to have ways for countries to rearrange tneir obligations  by paying others to undertake them. Such payments could be arranged in various ways. On paper the most elegant scheme would be to issue internationally tradable permits to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide. Companies or countries that could reduce their carbon-dioxide output cheaply would have an incentive to do so  and then sell the permits they saved to other  less efficient countries. But the initial distribution of permits would be just as problematic as the initial distribution of targets; besides  and there are precious few examples of successful national schemes. The sums that changed hands under a permit-trading scheme might be vast. Calculations for the World Development Report suggest that  if rights to emit were sold at $25 a ton of carbon  and if such rights were initially shared out on the basis of population  a sum roughly equivalent to total official aid in 1989. Equally improbable sums would change hands if  as others have suggested  governments levied a tax on carbon dioxide at a common rate and paid the proceeds into a pool  and it has the advantage of combining a uniform commitment with an economically efficient mechanism for reducing carbon dioxide. The disadvantage  though  as the EC is discovering  is that some countries will still find the costs of such action heavier than others--but no pool of revenue will be generated to pay them compensation. Some system of payments is essential. As Mr Barrett argues in a paper for the OECD  unless the extra benefits of co-operating to reduce global warming can be shared out in proportion to the costs of action that each country takes  some countries will find that they are worse off  under the climate treaty. Those countries will have an incentive to refuse to sign  or to sign and cheat. The greater the costs of taking action (in other words  the less account an agreement takes of cost-effectiveness)  the bigger will be their incentive to be free riders. And such payments must not be seen as a gift. The gainers from the climate treaty will gain only if the losers also sign  and comply. The OECD  as the last article argued  like those payments for wildlife conservation  as imports of environmental services  or as a way of sharing out the world's gains from co-operating. They will  however  increase the costs of (or rather  reduce the gains from) co-operation for the countries that provide the money. On the road to Rio  money has been the main north-south divide. A mechanism for side payments exists: the Global Enveironment Facility (GEF)  set up in 1990 to pay for pilot projects that reduce climate change and conserve biodiversity. The Rio conference will agree to channel extra money--probably between $2 billion and $5 billion over three years--into the GEF. The developing countries have been demanding that the GEF'S structure be reformed  to give them more say over where the money goes. But the developed countries are anxious to avoid a repetition of the problems that have surrounded the interim fund created under the Montreal protocol. There  work programmes have been scrutinised in mind-numbing detail; some officials claim that more has been spent on travelling to and from meetings than on the individual programmes so far discussed. That would not be difficult: more than a year after the interim fund has been set up  managed in the World Bank by a quarter the number of people running the Montreal protocol fund for the United Nations Environment Programme  has formally approved nine projects in the first year of its existence and disbursed $36m. However carefully a compensation scheme is designed  and however much money passes across the exchanges  some governments will be tempted to cheat. For the countries that expect to gain most from preventing climate change One  suggested by Mr Barrett  is the concept of a matching commitment. If one country drops out  if an extra country joins  the obligations on signatories are stepped up. The theory is that the gains that the recalcitrant country might otherwise expect would be reduced as a result of its own actions. Such an arrangement would  for instance  allow the EC to promise that if the United States accepted a common target  the Community would increase the rate of carbon tax it imposed on itself and vice versa. More probable is the use of some kind of trade sanctions. The Montreal protocol provides a precedent  but not a terribly useful one  in giving signatories the right to ban imports of CFCS from non-signatories. It is hard to imagine most countries banning imports of fossil fuels  however  all too easy to imagine governments imposing some kind of rough-and-ready """"countervailing carbon tax"""" on free riders. The danger with such trade measures is that their cost  in terms of lost welfare  would be greater than the gains in welfare that a watertight climate treaty might bring. BEYOND PRICE The chances that the climate treaty will significantly change the world's output of fossil fuels over the next century is extremely slender. Does this matter? If the figures in the previous article for the costs of damage likely to be done by climate change are accurate  then the honest answer is """"no"""". It would  of course  in the interests of buying insurance against nasty surprises--although it is impossible to know how large a premium it would be right to pay. Beyond that  adapting to climate change  when it happens  for a number of reasons. Most countries will be richer then  and so better able to afford to build sea walls or develop drought-resistant plants. Money that might now be spent on curbing carbon dioxide output can be invested instead  either in preventing more damaging environmental change (like rapid population growth  the most environmentally harmful trend of all) or in productive assets that will generate future income to pay for adaptation. Once climate change occurs  it will be clearer--as it now is not how much needs to be done  and what  and where. Most of the decisions involved in adapting will be taken and paid for by the private sector rather than (as with curbing greenhouse-gas output) by government. Above all  adapting requires no international agreements. Many people will find such a prospect palatable. Here at last  it seems  is nature's revenge on humanity for economic growth. The sheer intricacy of the problems involved in climate change give the issue a special appeal. In the past three years it has attracted more research  than any previous environmental issue. In fact  plenty of other kinds of environmental damage deserve greater priority. Water pollution kills more people than global warming is likely to do; soil erosion leaves more people hungry; the loss of species is just as irreversible; deforestation has locally (and perhaps internationally) dramatic effects on climate. The world has only so much wealth to devote to solving environmental problems. Any one of these deserves greater priority than global warming."""

A 20-member Community would have to abandon the right of each member to say its bit at Council meetings. Such a tour de table  plus the commission's intervention and the president's summing-up  could last four hours. Mounting numbers would  turn the council into more of a senate and less of a negotiation between governments. This prospect of the council being a parliament of nations where the vote's the thing is hard to deny. But it remains anathema to most ministers attending it. As would-be members apply  they will be faced with the two basic EC criteria (both always described in French  perhaps for the extra mystery thus conferred): do they swear to accept both the acquis communautaire and the finalite politique? In other words  and do they accept that the EC's goal is political union? Broadly speaking  the Eftans will have no trouble accepting the acquis but will be more reserved about the finalite  where the newcomers from central Europe will have precisely the opposite reaction. It is the sight of the Swiss practising such promises in their shaving-mirrors that brings the depth of Europe's transformation home. NEUTRAL AGAINST WHOM? Blend together the ambition of the Maastricht treaty and the Swiss government's recent decision to apply to join the EC and you have as good a proof as any that the role of the European nation-state is changing. For more than 500 years Switzerland's neutrality has been basic to its national identity. That neutrality is  or was  a thing apart from any other practised in Europe. Most of Europe's neutral zone involved a decision not to take military sides in the cold war. Switzerland's permanent armed neutrality is  in contrast  a strategy that has been continuously refined since the country was invaded by the French at the end of the 18th century. It demands that Switzerland be demonstrably vulnerable to nobody This  coupled with an ever-present calculation of how wealth is best enhanced  is what swung the Swiss to vote against membership of the United Nations in 1986. In the late 1980s  Swiss direct democracy (referendums)  Swiss federalism  the parliament's authority  the supreme court's competence  farm aid  immigration control and the government's treaty-making powers. It seems incredible that the Swiss public would abandon these endangered habits as fast as their government has done--as unthinkable as all the other unthinkable things that have happened in Europe since 1989. The best guide as to whether the Swiss will take this plunge will come later this year when they vote on whether to form part of a European Economic Area (EEA) linking the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) to the EC. In moving from EFTA through EEA to EC  these countries are experiencing the various stages of trade freedom--and of national surrender--that are involved in the building of trading blocks. The basic free-trade area is a tariff-and quota-free zone. Its members have no mutual tariffs or quotas  but they retain differing tariffs against the outside world  such as the European Community was till recently  with a common external tariff and a common external-trade policy. A customs union  however  removes only one need for mutual customs-posts. Others remain  differing regimes of farm support and differing commercial laws. To get rid of these reasons for frontier-posts requires a move towards a single market  either by harmonising commercial standards or by agreeing to accept some leakage between regimes. Such an area aims to achieve the EC's """"four freedoms"""" (of people  goods  services and money) across its internal frontiers. It requires a centralised authority to enforce the common rules that make them possible. The EFTA countries have come from being a basic free-trade area  when EFTA was first set up in 1960  to something close to a single market. The EEA  links EFTA and the EC in all the four freedoms provided by the EC's 1992 programme. So a Portugese bank will able to set up a branch in Switzerland and have it regulated from Portugal  and a Greek worker will be able to settle in Sweden  provided he has a job to go to. This commitment has involved the EFTA countries in bowing to large chunks of the EC regime that makes the four freedoms possible within the Community  including environment rules  competition rules  and bans on state aid for industry. The exceptions  which will prevent the EEA from being a frontier-free market  are that the EEA is not a customs union  its attempt to have both internal-trade freedom and varying trade policies vis-a-vis the outside world involves a vast protocol of rules of origin which define what makes a good freely movable within the EEA. This unwieldy EEA agreement will give the average EFTA State a good foretaste of unsovereign life in the court of Brussels. Community rules will apply  and unlike in EFTA  the commitments will be enforced through a (somewhat fudged) system of courts. The Eftans have also agreed to pay contributions to the Community's """"cohesion fund"""" Austria  for example  calculates that it will pay ASch5 billion ($450m) a year to be in the EEA compared with a net cost of about ASch14 billion if it joined the EC. The Swedish government reckons that it has already settled between one-half and two-thirds of the negotiations needed to take it into the Community. Of the seven EFTA countries  only Norway  Iceland and Liechtenstein are still balking at applying to the Community. What is moving the rest of the Eftans to leave their free-trade area? First  there is the gravitational pull of a powerful trading block and rule-system  and the sense of discrimination in being outside it. Second is the dwindling desire in some of these countries to protect their own economic ways. In Finland's case the reason is obvious: the collapse of the Soviet Union meant that only 5% of Finnish exports went there last year  compared with 25% in the early 1980s. The EEA countries now account for almost two-thirds of Finnish trade. Finland was long a prosperous trading oddity. No more. As for Sweden the point is well made by the prime minister  Carl Bildt: """"In the 1960s we used to think we represented a superior sort of society; that we should not mingle with dubious Catholics and reactionaries down on the continent. Why join Europe  when Europe was going to join Sweden? In the 1970s the Social Democrats went through a radical phase: capitalism was a dirty word and the ideologues said it was a choice between membership of the EC and socialism  anyway  Europe was not so attractive at the time. Then came the concept of the third way--of offering something between the raw capitalism of the West and the planned economies of the East. That concept has now collapsed; you can't be half-way between a success and a failure."""" The equation of the EC with economic liberalism is a factor in Switzerland's new interest  too. There is today much worry within Switzerland that its closely regulated and cartelised economy is not prospering as it used to--that its economy needs to be ventilated by being opened up to the EC. The third driving-force is impatience with the half-way house of the EEA  particularly in Austria  which applied for membership of the Community back in 1989. Andreas Khol  explains: """"A cynic would say that Mr Delors and his commission have never wanted new members. That is why they invented the EEA. Now they want to keep us in it like well-fed slaves."""" The last and strongest factor is the eastern revolution. As Europe's confrontation has faded  so the feeling has grown that the EFTA neutrals no longer have anyone to be neutral against. This does not prompt them to take up arms and join military alliances  however: their appetite is  for collective systems of security. Mr Bildt puts it this way: """"Swedes have retracted into neutrality whenever great power conflicts have loomed in northern Europe. But whenever there has been a chance of establishing a wider system of security  we have been in the forefront of it."""" Austria  Sweden and Finland are keen to get involved in an EC foreign policy that works as another powerful forum for the fostering of reasonableness. Even Switzerland seems to be moving in this direction and away from its hedgehog pose of well-defended non-involvement. The Eftans will not accept the idea of a Community defence policy  however. All their governments heaved a sigh of relief when the 12 at Maastricht stopped short of common defence  which the treaty mentioned only as an aim  they ask  why should we be expected to be more committed to common defence than are some existing members? Mr Khol in Vienna is more robust. Austria  he says  needs time to get its people used to the idea of a defence Community: if one were to emerge  Austria would be part of it. So the Austrians and Viking will reinforce Maastricht's emphasis on a Community of sovereign states. They will not want to undermine the role of NATO. They will be particularly keen on subsidiarity: """"as little Brussels as possible  as much Brussels as is necessary."""" They will probably advance the cause of EMU  because they are bored with the speculative buffeting of their currencies. The Swedes have already asked if they can join the European monetary system. The Nordic group will be happy to be part of the Schengen area of the Community in which people can move without border controls: they already run a passport union which includes Denmark. Will the Eftans really join? This remains less certain than the governments would lead one to believe. The Danish cliff-hanger of a referendum on Maastricht gives a foretaste of popular suspicion that Nordic habits--solitariness  but with mutual support; intense respect for nature; a belief in conciliation; self-denying ordinances to rein in their love of alcohol--will be undermined by southern rule. Austrians have come to regard neutrality as a magic provider of prosperity. The Swiss  however rattled FARMERS AND PARK-KEEPERS The combination of the single market and the ambitions of Maastricht have buried an old lie that Europe's common agricultural policy (CAP) is the heart of the Community  or the """"only common policy that Europe's got"""". Its demotion is timely  for the CAP is going to be more battered in the decade of the 1990s than any other habit of the cosy  was taken up by the Uruguay round of trade talks  and continued with the recent MacSharry plan to reform the policy. Next comes enlargement. This will make the CAP do the splits between some of the EFTA newcomers who consider the CAP too rigorous  and the three Central European would-be members  which have just gone through a farming reform that makes the MacSharry regime seem like a kindegarten. The EFTA and EC countries share an attitude to farmers. They are a protected species  kept comfortable by societies rich enough  through their industry and services  which promised to raise the standard of living of farmers. Modern governments have been ingenious in devising means of helping farmers. And recently much effort has gone into comparing those approaches so that rules on trade can be devised. The table opposite provides a graspable way of seeing how different OECD countries have gone about it. The first column shows the total subsidy each country sends its farms. The last three columns are the most helpful. They show how much each person in each country is sending farms  both by way of taxes and by paying more for food than is necessary. The average EC citizen is now paying over $400 a year  or over $1 000 per household  with the emphasis being on taxes. The average Swiss  Norwegian or Finn  on the other hand  is paying around $1 000 a year for the rural idyll. The average Australian and New Zealander pays almost nothing--but he  conveniently  for Europe  Poland  Czechoslovakia and Hungary have been through such an economic upheaval of late that no comparable figures yet exist. But America's Department of Agriculture's best current guess is that farming in all three is now unsubsidised  overall: in fact Central European subsidies are probably negative at the moment because of a recent collapse of purchasing power and farm prices in these economies. THE RIGGING REDESIGNED The balance between the consumer element and taxpayer element in farm aid plays a big part in the story of the reform of the CAP  and will do so again in negotiating membership for some of the EFTA countries. When the CAP was set up  the EC was not self-sufficient in most foods and therefore a net importer of them. So Brussels adopted an elegant way of helping farmers. It set a minimum EC price for each commodity and defended that price against cheaper imports by imposing a variable levy on them. For as long as a hungry Europe was net importer of food  and such aid did not have to be haggled over in any budgets. As soon as European farming started to produce surpluses  the elegance vanished. Between 1973 and 1988 the volume of EC farm output grew at 2% a year  while consumption went up by only 0.5%. Today the EC produces 25% more than it consumes In the late 1970s and early 1980s the main argument was about the effect of this on the EC budget. The main answer was recourse to bureaucratic ways of rationing output. This can be done either through quotas  which work well with milk because milk does not keep and is hard to smuggle to other farms; or by making farmers """"set aside"""" acreage unsown; or by fining farmers for producing bumper crops. After 1986  however  farming became part of the GATT negotiations  the Irishman who took over as farm commissioner in 1989  was to bring EC prices much closer to world ones  and to help farmers  instead  with direct income aid aimed at the smaller farms. It took Mr MacSharry almost 18 months to overcome widespread resistance to this logic. The deadlock in the GATT talks over farming shamed Europe's governments into seeing things his way. The price of their acceptance was some dilution. First  the price cuts were reduced a bit. The present EC intervention price for wheat of 155 ecus a tonne is to be slashed not to 100 ecus  as Mr MacSharry wanted  the balance in our table will shift firmly towards the taxpayer. Tell that to the Finns. The table shows how they are the farm-subsidy champions of Europe  raising almost three times as much for their farmers through price-rigging as the average EC country does. The farm-gate price for milk in Finland is 60% higher than the EC price. The cereal price is currently double the EC'S  and now the EC price is set to drop sharply. Of all the current applicants for membership  Finland has the most intractable farming predicament. The entire country lies north of the line at which Sweden finds that farming becomes problematic. The government knows that the income differential across its border with Russia is one of the biggest in the world and that this 1 200 kilometre frontier--longer that the distance between the Baltic and Black seas--is unpoliceable. It therefore claims a special need to keep its frontier-country populated. Finland's farm negotiations could imperil its ently into the EC. Could but probably won't  because--in contrast to Norwegians  with their energy wealth--the average Finn accepts that his country's industrial interests must outweigh its farming ones. In any case  and Finland feels that its chilly north qualifies as a new categoly of disadvantaged farmland to match the hill farms of Europe to the south. Transitional arrangements will not help Finland: it does not feel that any transition to a depopulated landscape is bearable. Norway thinks the same. Switzerland and Austria have problems of a different kind that beg for different solutions. They  too  beat the EC in farm support  there is a hardheaded awareness that the cowbell-clonking cow and the dirndl-wearing farmer's wife are a potent part of the two countries' attraction for tourists. Both countries are following MacSharry down the road towards income support in place of production subsidy. Both are wrestling with the widespread problem that farmers want to be thought of as food producers rather than park keepers. But park-keeping will not go away. Already  in parts of Austria  farmers are paid to take their cows up to mountain pastures rather than fatten them more cheaply in sheds in the valley. The hikers are waiting up there with Nikons at the ready. Austria's farm regime is easier to align with the EC'S than Switzerland's. But Austria is a neighbour of Hungary  and this closeness to the most effective ex-communist economy offers a daunting prospect for its farmers. """"Where they compete with us  we can't let more than a purely symbolic amount of their produce in without ruining our own agriculture 000 hectolitres of wine per year. We are ready to accept 100 hectolitres. They say 500 tonnes of salami. We say 100. The gap is vast. We would prefer that they be given money to sell their products to the former Soviet Union."""" Here is a nice example of hostalgia for Comecon perdu. It introduces the second great challenge of Europe's enlargement: the integration of Poland  Hungary  and Czechoslovakia. GUILT BY ASSOCIATION Wherever the European Community spreads  a horde of acronyms moves before it. Welcome to the CEECS (the Central and Eastern European Countries)  the PECOS (Pays d'Europe Centrale et Orientale)  the PITS--which means Poland  Czechoslovakia and Hungary. There is a revealing passage about them in the internal paper on enlargement prepared late last year by the European Commission. """"Basically  it says  """"there is a contradiction between the trade-liberalisation policies undertaken by the PECOS and their wish to join an economic community. This contradiction arises in areas such as textiles  steel and coal as well as agriculture  but the CAP is its most spectacular manifestation."""" The Central European trio are  indeed  poor fortress-building material. Czechoslovakia and Poland (but not Hungary) now run import regimes that out-liberalise those of many OECD countries. Poland and Hungary have applied market medicine to their farmers in doses that would be unthinkable in Western Europe. In 1991 Hungary cut its agricultural-export subsidies by 50% in one year  corroborating the hunch of the American Department of Agriculture cited earlier. This rigour was sustained despite a 36% fall in Polish farm incomes between the last half of 1990 and the first half of 1991. The trio can scarcely be called homogeneous  ranging from the almost Austrian efficiency of Budapest to the third-world disorder that reigns in the anterooms of Warsaw. But they are united in their enthusiasm for membership of the Community  and are marching towards it in locked step  Hungary  in February 1991. Their joint aims will confound almost everybody. Those secretly hoping that widening the Community eastwards will halt its """"deepening"""" must accept that these would-be members want the whole federal dream--or so their leaders say. Those who count upon Comecon escapees to cherish their independence will hear them explain that """"national identity is something that does not depend upon sovereignty"""". Those who feel that the EC must assert itself against America will be piqued: the trio want NATO membership quite as much as European defence. Their links with Brussels have had to be developed at tremendous speed. It was not until 1988 that Moscow would concede that the European Community represented the trade policies abroad of its members. In July 1989 the commission won the job of co-ordinating all western aid to Eastern Europe and of monitoring the Eastern European countries' worthiness to receive it. This was seen by a delighted commission as a nice symbol of the EC'S emerging role in Europe  and of America's recognition of it. In practice  western countries preferred to go on giving aid on their own terms As soon as Moscow softened  the EC signed trade and co-operation agreements with the former communist countries. These gave them the trading terms they could have had as members of Comecon had Moscow permitted it. In particular  they replaced hundreds of national import quotas with EC-wide protection. The association agreements--now called """"Europe agreements""""--that then followed were originally seen by the Community as a surrogate for membership. The ex-communist countries would commit themselves to good democratic government; their reward would be membership of a sort of third tier of the Community beyond the European Economic Area. The commission wanted to avoid the prospect of membership raised in the Greek and Turkish association agreements--and the embarrassment that the undertakings to Turkey subsequently caused. The Visgrad trio fought hard against such tiering. In return for agreeing that multiparty democracy  human rights  the rule of law  they won a clause in the preamble accepting that """"the final objective of Hungary (or Poland or Czechoslovakia) is to become a member of the Community and that this association  in view of the parties  will help to achieve this objective."""" The EC  note  did not express enthusiasm. The essence of the Europe agreements is that they will """"gradually"""" establish a free-trade area between the EC and the trio over a transition period lasting not more than a decade; and that this mutual opening of markets will be asymmetric--the EC will do more in the first five years  the trio in the second. Not bad on the face of it; but sadly these agreements are deeply ungenerous. The commitment does not hold for farm products  which  currently account for one-quarter of its exports to the EC. Here  the initial gestures are pitiful. Hungary  for example  will be permitted in the first year to sell just 5 000 tonnes of beef to the Community. This annual allowance will rise to 6 600 tonnes over five years. In the mid-1970s Hungary was selling a smaller EC some 100 000 tonnes of beef a year  paying whatever levies the EC was charging to bring imported beef up to the CAP price. Turning to non-farm products  roughly 40% Of Hungary's exports to the EC have  under the agreement  when the trade part of the pact took effect. A more generous gesture? Not really: most of those goods had been traded freely since 1990. Textiles and clothing (15% of Hungarian exports to the EC) remain subject to quotas whose removal has yet to be negotiated. Steel (59%) will be quota-free but with duties declining over six years. Industrial goods accounting for the remaining 15% are divided into no fewer than 93 """"sensitive"""" product lines  each of which will sport its own gradually loosening import regime. These percentages  remember  reflect Hungary's current  in which agriculture and textiles would feature more strongly. Nor does this crude impression of Hungary's trade deal capture the complexity of the safeguard clauses  and rules of origin that the EC has insisted upon; nor  to be fair  the mysteries of Hungary's own regime against goods from the EC. To talk to the trade officials who negotiated Hungary's deal is to sense that a whole cadre of clever state planners has been offered new employment by the intricacies of managed trade with the EC. Indeed  in all three countries unemployment among trade negotiators must be low. The European agreements required not only deals with the EC  but deals with EFTA (country by country for agriculture) It all amounts to a trade labyrinth barely worth entering  were it not for the glimmer of trade freedom that supposedly lies at the end of it. The central European trio have a joint GDP that some think is equal to that of Austria. Is their potential to harm parts of EC industry so great that protection of such complexity is required? Sariusz Wolski  Poland's chief negotiator with the EC  but Western European protectionism makes the cost of doing this harder to bear. The West urges market economics on the trio  yet also makes sure that their trade and therefore industry remains thoroughly bureaucratised. The West is stingy with aid--unlike Greece and Turkey  the trio got no """"financial protocols"""" in their European agreements--but stingy  too  with the trade that would make such aid less important. He dismisses Poland's European agreement as """"the right to knock on windows."""" It is frankly amazing""""  says Mr Wolksi  """"that the EC should feel it has such a problem adjusting to us. The Community now accounts for 57% of our trade. We account for about 1% of its trade. We think that the threat posed by our textiles and food has not been properly assessed. Look what has happened as a result of visa-less travel. There has been no flood of people. The same truth will be revealed when the market is opened to our goods."""" The chaotic administrative state of Poland suggests  that he is right; and  second  that Poland's struggling entrepreneurs need all the western encouragement they can get. Where the EFTA countries are  to European enthusiasts  economically sound but politically suspect  simply by joining the EC. But the strongest reason why they want to join remains political  not economic. They are looking for something to cling to in a crumbling part of the world  and that leads straight to the question of European defence. UNITED IN RIVALRY While the problems of Maastricht and enlargement will grind on  the matters that could really buffet the European Community over the rest of this decade will be foreign policy  security and defence. This is because what the late Andrew Schonfield called the EC'S """"illusion of privacy within the international system The continent of Europe is today one of the least stable on earth  but without the prospect of """"a monstrous tyranny"""" or """"a new dark age"""" to make sure that America watches over it while Brussels gets on with lawn-mower directives. Europe's instabilities particularly touch Europe's would-be members to the east. They look to Western Europe for security  and America expects Western Europe to provide them with it. The ugly phrase """"collective security"""" is in vogue. It comes into its own when big threats recede. Such security consists of forums of nations  which enshrine certain standards of behaviour  and promote them with diplomatic action or  with peacekeeping forces. It seems apt when the continent's main source of violence is the break-up of multi-ethnic states  rather than any overt aggressor that only armies can cope with. Collective security is like group therapy: useful when neighbours quarrel  but  when they resort to armed robbery  no substitute for the police. The coming enlargement will bring in countries with lots of enthusiasm for collective security. Rudolph Joo of the Hungarian defence ministry points out that Hungary has been given three new neighbours within the past six months: Slovenia  Ukraine and Croatia. The war in Yugoslavia threatens Hungarian minorities there and has sent 50 000 refugees to Hungary. So Hungary has an intense interest in any suasion that can be applied to damp down that war and protect the rights of its minorities abroad. The central Europeans also share the big unstated desire of the existing EC members and America to contain united Germany. Like France  and talk a lot of the need to protect Germany from """"temptation"""". The EC with its associates form a natural temptation-damper  upholding the right values  deeply involving the members  whenever they can reach agreement  expressing disapproval abroad with collective force. Switzerland apart  the exEFTA members want to play their part in this: Sweden is a practised provider of peacekeeping forces. The club complements Europe's other security-enhancers  the 24-member Council of Europe with its Court of Human Rights  and the CSCE  which embraces the former Soviet Union and North America and is an accepted referee on arms control  elections and human and minority rights. So far  so good. The trouble is that the nice distinction between therapy and police work is blurring  and with it the convenient distinction between the Community's foreign and security policy  and its defence policy  as merely envisaged there. The civil war in Yugoslavia is pushing the West ever closer to using its soldiers as peacemakers rather than peacekeepers. The CSCE may soon be inviting NATO troops or troops ofthe WEU  the Western European Union  to intervene forcefully in such conflicts. What will the Swedes or Germans make of that? When it comes to using force  European morale is sapped by a never-ending argument between the Euro-centrics and the Atlanticists. NATO remains unable to broaden its mandate to deal with threats to America's and Europe's joint interests outside the NATO area. The French resist such a broadening  and Germany's constitution makes it hard for it to send troops abroad anyway. Nor can NATO easily extend its military shield to include the Central European countries: American public opinion would not accept a Ukrainian foray into Poland as an attack on America  NATO  too  has gone into the therapy business. Its North Atlantic Co-operation Council is duplicating the CSCE as a vast forum of nations. Now it is exploring how it might provide peacekeeping forces at the behest of the CSCE. As for the EC  it has set about forging common foreign  security and defence policies in a singular way. When they first created themselves  however  is being built from the bottom up  using sovereign states as bricks and commerce as mortar. Independent armed forces remain the guarantors of members' sovereignty; any member can still walk out of the EC without a red army stopping it. This desire for militaly independence is not something that can be lightly signed away. It is a given that will fade only with time spent living under Brussels law  and only if real threats unite Europe rather than divide it. The Maastricht treaty asks the till-now moribund Western European Union to """"elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the union which have defence implications"""". The WEU is to move to Brussels  set up a planning cell  and invite all non-WEU-members within the EC (Greece  Ireland) to join it  and all non-EC-members within NATO (Turkey  Norway  Iceland) to become associate members. Is this WEU a pillar of NATO  a complement to NATO or a rival to NATO? Well might you ask. In a mission statement last December  the WEU governments agreed thet it would be developed """"as the defence component ofthe European Union and as the means to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic alliance"""". That sounded straightforward enough. But WEU'S planners already talk of restricting NATO to its current role so as to """"leave the WEU a job to do."""" The Maastricht treaty's commitments on foreign policy are  studded with clauses that promise incoherence in Europe's common defence. These commitments shall """"not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member-states""""--that means individualistic France and neutral Ireland. They shall """"not prevent development of closer co-operation between two or more member-states on a bilateral level""""--that means the newly created Franco-German corps. This 35 000 strong corps symbolises the current tension over the future defence of Europe. For the French it is the kernel of a European army free of American influence  which is exactly why the British and Americans detest it. The Germans do the splits between the two sides This dilemma has been there since the EC was created  but has become acute with the passing of the cold war. America's military commitment to Europe is now wobbling. Europe's military commitment to Europe still barely exists. Any attempt to build the second shakes the first. WHITE HELMETS How to proceed? By building WEU with extreme caution  given the materials available. Effective defence depends upon decisiveness. The Community is still a long way from being naturally decisive in foreign policy  let alone defence. As Niels Ersbol  says: """"These are areas where members are simply not ready to accept the Community model."""" If that suggests lack of vision  consider the problem of conscripts. The Gulf war made it suddenly clear to France that it was hard to send national conscripts to join a supranational force. Defence of the nation by conscripts was fine  but not sending them to face distant risk in a common cause. The EC'S newly created citizens need more time before they will allow their conscripted sons to march off in a WEU expeditionaly force. As new members stream into the EC  the problem of indecision will  if anything  Britain and France  will be submerged among well-meaning countries that do not have the instinct to project military power. Germany will not fight the trend. Neutral countries will not join the EC; the EC will join the neutrals. That is one big reason why this survey ends with a plea: let the enlarged Europe be a more flexible one--a Community in which things done jointly can also be things done well. DREAMING SPIRES Peter Balazs  secretary of state in the Hungarian trade ministry  ponders the """"Comecon isation of the European Community"""". He recalls the ingredients of Comecon's failure. It was held together by coercion. It was centralised. It was planned. It was introverted. It was inflexible. This provides a check-list to help judge the EC'S chances of shaping Europe into the next century. COERCED? No: members still retain a sovereign right to apply to join the EC or to quit it  without a centralised armed force threatening to stop them. But there are worrying tendencies. The mounting power of the EC trade block gives nearby countries an ever smaller option but to be subject to its rules  whether they help frame them or not. The growing significance in world trade of foreign direct investment raises the economic price of remaining outside. The dash towards union has featured politicians running too far ahead of their electorates  the Community becomes a useless defuser of nationalism. Nation-states and ethnic regions are tempted to express their identity against the Community  rather than through it. The antidotes to coercion are an open trading regime with the outside world  the greatest possible degree of Maastricht's promised """"subsidiarity"""" and democratic openness in the way the EC is built and run. The last of these is tricky. National parliamentarians--particularly British ones--who growl about """"unelected officials"""" in Brussels growl still louder if told that these faceless ones will be given democratic credibility by the European Parliament in Strasbouq. The evolution of pan-European democracy will have to remain a careful blend of directly elected MPS and an indirectly elected conclave of governments  which becomes more like a senate and more open to outside scrutiny than it is today. CENTRALISED AND PLANNED? This survey has explained how the single market was pulled together by members renouncing state dirigisme and the notion that national rules had always to be replaced with Brussels ones. Nevertheless  both habits retain a powerful appeal. The commission itself  while small by the standards of national bureaucracies National ministers often misuse the commission and council to concoct laws. Why? Because they find they are stronger in the council of their fellow ministers in Brussels than they are in their cabinets at home. Recently the 12 governments asked the commission to draft a directive on health and nutrition. Mr Delors--convinced of late that the Community should do fewer things  better  rather than dabble in everything poorly--refused. He explained that guidance on healthy eating  could and should remain a matter for individual countries. The other commissioners backed him (just) in renouncing this right to prescribe the European adult's minimum daily intake of Community law. As the EC expands  it will become ever more vital that it permits competition between systems of government  rather than attempts to harmonise them. Those who argue that labour laws or industrial policy must be levelled to remove unfairness within the European market are implicitly suggesting that the result must be shielded against """"unfair"""" competition from the world outside. The best check of the virtue of any national system of  apprentice-training is that its results beat those of European countries that do things differently. INTROVERTED? The EC was built introvertedly during the cold-war era. It seemed good enough that the nation-states of Europe could be extrovert towards each other. The question of their joint attitude towards the outside world did not arise--and barely needed to. Maastricht was the last feast of introversion  and now  alas For the external obligations are crowding in. The queue of would-be members is one of them. The sight of Yugoslavia at war with itself is another. The pressure from the Uruguay round on European protectionism in farming and textiles is a third. The need of Eastern Europe for free trade and wise aid is a fourth. The fact that the EC can no longer blithely count on America to defend it is probably the biggest. This survey has touched upon many of those  and painted a mixed picture. The threat of a Fortress Europe against imports has dwindled. By and large the ramparts are being levelled down rather up. Even the EC'S keep  the common agricultural policy  though with a reluctance that still helps to block improvements in the GATT. The sheer variety of the new members-in-waiting makes a fortress everharder to imagine. On the other hand the """"Europe agreements"""" with the central European countries are unimaginatively selfish. As for foreign policy and defence  it would be rash for the world to count on much leadership from a united Europe soon. Maastricht proved that the members are still not ready to have a Community foreign policy based upon anything more constraining that their ability to reach unanimous agreement on a given problem. And in the matter of defence  the combination of a wobbling NATO pillar and competing plans for a European one is not impressive--but then neither  is the threat. Those impatient with this state of affairs must remember the Danish lesson on Maastricht--pan-European will-power cannot be signed into existence by far-sighted statesmen. INFLEXIBLE? The basic challenge for the EC in the post-cold-war world is to accept that a unitary federal republic of Europe is no longer a sensible dream. The diversity of the existing  let alone the new  members is so great that the price of one regime for all will be mediocrity The examples of such heresy multiply. The architecture of Maastricht's union  with its pillars for foreign and judicial policy outside the Community  is one. The Schengen passport-free zone  is another. The process of qualifying for economic and monetaly union is another. The decision of 11 members to go ahead and create social law  without Britain  is a fourth. The Franco-German corps is a stab at yet another. And it is possible that the Danes will be reconciled with Maastricht by a sixth--inviting them to be part of Maastricht's union but not of all of it. Now look ahead to an enlarged Europe. Is it credible to work towards a common foreign and security policy--which is getting ever harder to disentangle from defence--that embraces countries with a tradition of neutrality? It is surely a recipe for impotence. Is it credible to imagine Turkey  with its 60m people  rising to 83.7m by 2020  let alone providing the external frontier of a passport-free zone? Is it sensible to insist that island members  such as Britain  apply the same approach to people-control as landlocked members? Is it sensible  even  to make one agricultural regime embrace arctic herdsmen and the struggling banana plantations of Crete? Accepting that the answer is No--and in some case No  never--will not weaken the EC: it will strengthen it. But the change needs to be more than just accepted. It needs to be planned for  and the EC'S system of government adapted to cope. The basis of Community membership could be the single market and its obligations  for practical reasons  have to remain a powerful all-or-nothing affair. Those obligations would have  of necessity  to include a single trade and economic-sanctions policy. Beyond that there would be different realms of joint policy--monetaly  social  home affairs  foreign affairs and defence  and immigration for which there would be entry criteria. Members would not merely have the right to opt out of them: they could be kept out of them. For a unitary state  or anything aiming to become one  having such flexibility in government would be a nightmare. But with the EC'S singular construction it need not be. The EC'S council of ministers meet topic by topic  or voting  was limited to those who were bound by the joint policy in question. In the parliament the same principle would apply to an MP'S right to vote. When Western Europe was cleanly bound by sea and barbed wire  and the scope of its policies was less demanding  it could think of itself as a flat-topped Acropolis  while aspiring more loftily in its common govemment. The architecture must change to that of a Community with many pillars or spires. The right image from now on is of a Mont St Michel--with Jacques Delors and his successors preaching from the top-most pulpit."""

Not counting these  product liability has declined 36% since 1985. Medical-malpractice suits  are also falling. The growth of personal injury suits in state courts has levelled  too. There is plenty of evidence that Americans do not  as is supposed  sue at the drop of a hat. Most people injured by a doctor or product never even see a lawyer. Still 000 annual average in America (where some specialists  such as obstetricians  pay up to $250 000 a year in premiums). Gary Schwartz  a professor at UCLA  argues that the disparities have little to do with differences in liability law  as almost nowhere else  lawyers can take """"contingency fees"""": if they win  they are paid a percentage (usually a third or so) of the award; if not  they get nothing. Groups of plaintiffs alleging damages caused by the same defendant can file """"class actions"""". Pre-trial """"discovery""""  in which each side demands from the other information relevant (in theory) to the case  has few limits; other civil procedures are lax. America does have the world's freest litigation market. The crucial difference  however  is that juries decide cases and set damages; elsewhere judges do the job. American juries can even award """"punitive"""" damages to punish defendants for heinous behaviour. Studies by Rand's Institute for Civil Justice  show average jury awards rising sharply in real terms since the mid-1970s. Little of this is due to punitive damages; Michael Rustad  a professor at Suffolk University  has found there have been only 355 such awards since 1965. Instead the cause is mainly """"pain and suffering"""" awards. Juries have no idea how to put a price-tag on such things: one recently gave the wife of a man killed in an aeroplane crash $600 000 purely for the anguish he suffered in the minute before his death. More commonly  says Rand's Stephen Carroll  """"pain and suffering"""" awards have soared. Most lawsuits never come to trial  and few huge awards survive appeal. But """"pain and suffering""""--and  to a lesser extent  author of a recent book on American litigation  calls """"deregulated combat"""")  they create a legal structure that practically invites abuse. GUILTY For contingency-fee attorneys  who handle the vast majority of personal-injury cases  the combination has deliciously skewed the market incentives that govern their choices of which cases to take. When multi-million-dollar jackpots are possible  the settlement values of such cases rise. Meanwhile defence lawyers have every incentive to stall and haggle as long as possible. Unpredictability also induces some frivolous cases. The plaintiffs' bar is infamous for its nuisance suits  some of which border on extortion: for example  many shareholder """"derivative"""" suits alleging fraud or breach of fiduciary responsibility after corporate takeovers. Some lawyers have mastered procedural tricks But ambulance-chasers have no monopoly on frivolous litigation. Businesses are equally guilty. One top American M&A lawyer says that a target company's first response to a hostile takeover should be to sue the bidder--whether or not it has done anything wrong. When employees of a high-tech firm leave to start a new company  they are often hit with a trade-secret suit before they have even opened their new offices. Businessmen do not call such litigation frivolous; they call it """"strategic"""". Indeed  it is business litigation--not torts--that is growing fastest. Complex cases involving intellectual property  contracts and antitrust consume years and millions of dollars in legal fees. Corporate litigators  have as much incentive as contingency-fee lawyers to drag cases out. Calling himself a """"born protractor""""  a partner at one big firm brags to law-school audiences of a long antitrust case: """"My firm's meter was running all the time--every month for 14 years."""" The root of such fiascos is discovery  which accounts for 60% of the time and money spent on lawsuits. In a 1988 survey by Louis Harris  a big majority of litigators for both plaintiffs and defendants said that discovery is used as a weapon to increase a trial's cost and delay to the other side (nearly half said lawyers use it to drive up their own charges). Car companies have been asked to submit every complaint they have ever had about faulty headlights. In an IBM antitrust suit All this might be acceptable if the American legal system proved  in the end  an efficient means of resolving disputes or compensating injuries. But it isn't. Of the billions of dollars paid out each year for liability (more on this later)  for which read """"lawyers' fees"""". In Superfund pollution cases  fully 80% of the money goes to lawyers instead of cleaning up the environment. Courts are clogged. The average suit takes over a year to finish. In Chicago  the backlog for civil cases is eight years; in New Orleans  courts are so over-crowded that a judge recently declared the system unconstitutional--no one  was getting a fair trial. Part of the problem is due to increases in criminal cases  which take precedence over civil ones. But the antics of civil lawyers do not help. HIGHWAY PATROL Enter Mr Quayle  a right-wing Republican making an ironic plea for re-regulation: a set of proposals to toughen the rules that govern the civil-justice system. They have not got far in Congress. But the solicitor general  Kenneth Starr  believes that legal reform is in the air. Robert Litan  of the Brookings Institution  a Washington think-tank  agrees. He likens America's legal system to a jammed motorway. Ideas to get it unstuck fall into several categories. * The ABA's big idea is to build more lanes by pumping more money into the court system. No doubt some courts are woefully underfunded. But as any transport economist knows  as new lanes are built  traffic will invariably increase to fill them. * Conservatives would rather block access roads by making it harder to sue. They would introduce  as Mr Quayle proposes (in certain kinds of cases)  the """"English rule"""" of costs: the losing side pays the winner's legal fees. This would deter phoney claims. But it would also discourage risk-averse plaintiffs with legitimate but not air-tight cases. If any class of legal actions deserves the English rule  who basically decide whether and how to fight a case  who should pay--not their clients. A better British custom to imitate: if a plaintiff turns down a defendant's concrete offer of a settlement and then wins a smaller amount at trial  he must pay the defendant's legal costs. * Mr Litan prefers to build exit roads so people can leave the motorway quickly. Judges should set firm  early trial-dates  thus keeping lawyers from cranking up the """"discovery machine"""" to run indefinitely. A 1990 law has federal judges trying this. State courts should * Opening secondary routes would help too. Practically everyone from Mr Quayle to the ABA agrees that various forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR)--Formal mediation  arbitration  negotiation--should be encouraged. So should """"early neutral evaluation"""" * Increasingly  businesses are simply using private helicopters to fly over the motorway. Often this means hiring retired judges to rule on disputes. The drawback of """"rent-a-judge"""" for the public (if not for businesses) is that cases are confidential  so controversial goings-on can be kept secret. But such private courts are still appropriate for many routine business-to-business disputes. The most valuable reform does not fit neatly into Mr Litan's analogy. It is advanced by a group who studied the tort system for five years for the American Law Institute: a uniform scale for juries that puts a price on """"pain and suffering"""". Caps on such damages have been tried in some states. But ceilings mean that serious injuries can go undercompensated  while minor ones can win big cash from eccentric juries. Better to provide a schedule that tapers downwards. Juries could disregard it; but if they did  the scale would be a sound basis for appeal. Writing it would be hard. But once it was done TAXING TORTS The best of these ideas (few of which lawyers like) would work by making the legal system more rational  not less accessible. Courts in America have been powerful protectors of individual liberties and agents of social change--think of civil rights  or consumer protection. For all their complaints But more than a few Americans think that lawsuits and lawyers are imposing unnecessary costs on the economy  especially through the tort system. The debate over the precise size of this """"tort tax"""" is as polarised as the one over abortion. On one side there is Mr Quayle  whose $300 billion figure has no discernible connection to reality. On the other is the Association of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) Somewhat more plausibly than this astounding logic  Tillinghast  an insurance-industry consultant  about 2.5% of GNP. That is three times more than in any other rich country (see chart). (Chart omitted) Calculating the net """"tort tax"""" is  however  more complicated. To start with  some of the money goes to compensate victims. Defenders of the tort system also say that lawsuits encourage safety by deterring businesses from making defective products. Critics  including most businessmen  argue that the risks  costs and capriciousness of the tort system deter innovation. A recent book* published by the Brookings Institution indicates that both claims are shaky. Because the legal system is so unpredictable  it seems to fail to give manufacturers useful information about how (as opposed to whether) to be safe. But it is also difficult to find much hard evidence of lawsuits stifling innovation  apart from a few isolated examples: litigation over Bendectin  stopped development of that type of medicine; America's small-aircraft industry has virtually collapsed because of lawsuits. Whatever its effects on business  tort litigation is an easy target because its costs are so visible--the headline jackpot verdicts  the Tillinghast estimates. Many other countries simply internalise these costs through tougher regulation or more generous social programmes But those who worry that overlawyering is eroding America's competitiveness say the problem is deeper. Would America not be better off they ask  if it spent more time innovating instead of litigating? If more of its brightest young minds became engineers rather than lawyers? These are not idle questions. When """"declinists"""" ask them  they are not dreaming of some unreachable utopia. They are  looking enviously across the Pacific. * """"The Liability Maze""""  edited by Peter Huber and Robert Litan. The Brookings Institution  Washington Like so many things Japanese  the country's legal system is shrouded in myth. Most westerners believe litigation is shunned in Japan as too disruptive; that legal self-interest is sacrificed at the altar of social harmony; that lawyers are disrespected for being quarrelsome. The Japanese are happy to have these things believed about themselves--who wouldn't be? The trouble is  they are all half-truths. The first half-truth is that there are virtually no lawyers in Japan. There are indeed just over 14 000 bengoshi11-1/2 for every 100 000 Japanese 000 Americans. But bengoshi are mainly litigators; they handle only a small portion of Japan's lawyering. The rest falls to a hotchpotch of licensed judicial scriveners  administrative scriveners  patent attorneys and tax attorneys. On top of that are in-house corporate legal staffs filled with law graduates who never bothered to pass the bar exam; Sony  for example  employs 120 of them. Add it all up and Japan has around 125 000 suppliers of legal services. Nor does the dearth of bengoshi have anything to do with an aversion to contentiousness. It is a result of government policy. Each year about 23 000 Japanese (more per head than in America) take a tortuous three-part bar exam to win a place at the Legal Training and Research Institute (LTRI)  The state-run training facility for bengoshi. Just 600  pass. (In America the bar exam pass-rate is almost 70%.) Few succeed on the first try: the average entry age into the LTRI is 29. Most would-be bengoshi spend millions of yen on """"cram schools"""" to help them pass. Of those 600 who do  about 400 become practising lawyers  the rest prosecutors or judges. This formidable barrier to entry is the first component of a potent cartel. Consumer information is restricted by an advertising ban; prices are set by Nichibenren  the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations (see table). (Table omitted) Foreign lawyers  remember  thus protecting a valuable monopoly for Tokyo's commercial-law specialists. They turn it into stacks of cash. A 1987 study for Rand based on tax records showed the average take-home pay of Japanese international lawyers was more than $100 000--50% higher than hospital directors  four times that of university professors. Non-international lawyers do worse Prospective litigants do not do so well. In 1989 there were about 1.8m civil cases filed in Japan  the vast majority of which were small claims and other minor matters. Fewer than 250 000 were tort or sizable contract lawsuits. A survey of 194 big Japanese manufacturers found that only 24 had ever faced a product-liability suit at home (just seven lost); one car company was hit with 250 such suits a year in America The received wisdom that the Japanese do not sue because their culture is non-adversarial is easy to believe. When a Japan Air Lines (JAL) pilot deliberately plunged his jet into Tokyo Bay in 1982  killing 24 people  JAL's president kneeled in apology before the families of the victims. No lawsuits followed. Such acts of contrition are not unusual. To pundits Others are not so sure. They point to the lawyers. Look again at the fee schedule. To hire a lawyer for a suit  alleging  say  the retainer would be $30 000. Since there are no contingency fees in Japan  it would have to be paid in advance. Also there are steep filing fees that must be paid to the court in advance--$5 000 in this case. Such high upfront costs might not matter if justice were speedy. But because the supply of judges is so small  they are brutally overburdened; cases usually proceed at a pace of one day in court each month. The average case takes more than two years; complicated ones can run to five or ten. Revisionists point to cost and delay as the real reasons the Japanese do not sue. They label the traditional view """"the consensual myth"""". """"The idea that Japanese people do not pursue their self-interest in the courts because of a cultural preference for harmony""""  says Yukio Yanagida  a Tokyo commercial lawyer who has taught at Harvard There is another possibility: that the Japanese do not sue because they are rational  not reluctant. Rather than fighting in court  they use alternative ways to seek compensation. Insurance companies run claims centres to adjudicate car-accident cases. Consumer centres negotiate on other personal-injury disputes. Some industries have set up funds to pay product-liability claims; if a product marked with an SG (Safety Goods) seal causes an injury 000 in damages. Customers also negotiate with companies directly. JAL is said to have paid victims' families $450 000 each for the 1982 crash. Those avenues are cheaper and faster. But are they fair? Alternative procedures often produce awards consistent with what claimants would have got had they troubled to go to court. Japanese judges use clear  detailed formulae to calculate negligence and damages. These criteria are published; there are even Japanese comic books detailing how much you can expect for  say  an American law professor who studies Japan  found that in fatal traffic accidents  families who dealt with insurance companies directly did as well as those who went to trial. Because Japanese legal rules are predictable  he says  justice is done efficiently without courts and judges--or lawyers. This is fine as far as it goes. The Japanese civil-justice system admirably avoids the uncertainty trap that has made such a mess of America's system. Alternative means of resolving disputes are desirable. But an alternative is only an alternative if it is freely chosen. Many Japanese are compelled  by delays in the legal system and the scarcity and price of lawyers  to find other ways of seeking redress. Sometimes it works. But sometimes it doesn't. THE CARTEL'S COST On an island off Japan's southern coast  a rundown fishing village called Minamata shares a bay with Chisso  a chemical company. In the mid-1950s  and children were being born with deformities. Chisso  it seems  had been dumping raw mercury into the bay. The company denied wrongdoing and blamed the government for lax regulation. Protests were staged  followed by lawsuits in 1967. After more than 20 years of failed negotiations  mistrials and dead victims  one case ended in February. Chisso was ordered to pay damages to the families of 42 victims--of $30 000 each. The Minamata affair  which goes on (Chisso has appealed)  is a dramatic example of the failings of Japanese justice. Courts and lawyers exist to level the playing field in a dispute. Cases in which the two sides have drastically unequal bargaining power can be hard to settle fairly through negotiation  courts in Japan are in worse shape than in America. That is one consequence of enforcing the lawyers' cartel by keeping the number of bengoshi (and hence judges) artificially small. There are other consequences. The costs of hiring a lawyer have made some Japanese turn to less laudable methods of alternative dispute resolution. Japan's notorious gangsters  the yakuza  provide services performed elsewhere by lawyers: debt collection  help with corporate restructuring. """"In Britain  solicitors send a letter in these matters  says Mr Hamada. """"Japanese send yakuza. They are lawyers' biggest competition."""" Trying to spot unmet legal needs is like listening for the dog that doesn't bark. Yet reformist lawyers say that if lawyers were more plentiful and less costly  customers would appear. When local bar associations set up telephone hotlines--for complaints about employment discrimination  sex discrimination Under pressure  the Ministry of Justice recently increased the number passing the bar exam--to a whopping 700  starting in 1993. Reformers want to go further 000. Some in the justice ministry agree  citing the shortage of judges. Demand will increase even more if foreign lawyers are eventually allowed to hire bengoshi. Daunting obstacles remain. Despite problems with clogged courts  the government has no appetite for more litigation  which can  be embarrassing. Of the consumers of legal services  """"repeat players"""" might be expected to be a powerful constituency for change. But by employing non-bengoshi legal staffs  Japanese businesses have found a way round the cartel. Most important  few lawyers want this lucrative arrangement dented. Of the world's lawyers  the Japanese are the most self-righteous Indeed  only one group would gain from greater access to lawyers: their would-be customers. But because people seldom use lawyers  they do not think of themselves as consumers of legal services. That is why lawyers rarely face popular demands for change--and not just in Japan. For reforms to be successful  consider Britain. Raise a glass for Betty Boothroyd. Earlier this year Miss Boothroyd became the first woman speaker of Britain's House of Commons; also the first to take the chair unadorned by the traditional speaker's wig. Her decision made headlines in London  then overseas  and revived a long-simmering debate among barristers and judges over whether to shed their horsehair toupees. After days of heated argument came the decision: more debate was needed before taking so bold a step. Change does not come easily to the British legal profession. Outside the slick solicitors' offices of the City of London  life for many lawyers has remained much as it was 100 years ago. There is still more than a whiff of """"Bleak House"""" about barristers' cramped  creaky chambers. The wigs  the haughty judges refusing to acknowledge women barristers whose shoes are not quite right--to visitors  and to many Britons  it all seems archaic. But much of the anachronism is not so quaint. The profession is split  as in fewer and fewer countries  between barristers (4 6 900 practising independently) and solicitors (57 000). For centuries the profession was riddled with restrictive practices: only barristers could appear in higher courts  but their clients had to go through solicitors to hire them; solicitors had a monopoly on the legal end of housebuying; for barristers  partnerships with one another or other professionals were not allowed; neither was advertising; judges could not speak to the press. Then  in 1987  Margaret Thatcher appointed Lord Mackay of Clashfern as Britain's Lord Chancellor. It is a powerful position: presiding over the House of Lords  a Calvinist and a Scot whose father was a railway signalman  he was not much like his sniffier brethren at the bar. Immediately he set about a series of reforms intended to be the legal profession's Big Bang. Dickens wrote that """"the one great principle of the English law is to make business for itself"""". Lord Mackay sought to introduce another: that the interests of customers should be put ahead of lawyers'  and that consumers of legal-services would benefit from competition among suppliers. The barristers' monopoly meant that a client had to pay both solicitor and barrister for a service that  often In 1989 Lord Mackay published three """"green papers"""" with proposals to bust the monopolies. After specialised training and study  any lawyer would be able to appear before any court. Financial institutions would be allowed to handle conveyancing. Barristers could advertise  take instructions from clients directly and form partnerships with solicitors and other professionals. Solicitors would  be eligible to become judges. Barristers and law lords (all of whom are ex-barristers) lashed out at Lord Mackay with the ferocity of French farmers defending their subsidies. The lord chief justice said the green papers were among """"the most sinister documents ever to emanate from government."""" Lord Hailsham said the government was """"thinking with its bottom"""". Others compared Lord Mackay's ideas to those found in South Africa and Nazi Germany. One said he was--horrors--""""treating judges like civil servants"""". Solicitors were subtler. The right to appear in court was to them a symbol of equality with barristers. But the conveyancing monopoly was bread-and-butter. Walter Merricks  of the Law Society  reckons that 10% of solicitors would be affected by the first reform  while campaigning to let solicitors into court  the Law Society lobbied quietly to link concessions on this to a compromise on conveyancing. That is what they got. Two years after the Courts and Legal Services Act of 1990 was passed  solicitors still have an effective monopoly on conveyancing. With the collapse of British property markets  financial institutions lost interest in providing the service; but Lord Mackay still has statutory authority to create a new regulatory body to authorise them to do so--which he says he will use if demand returns. Also shelved were direct access to barristers and multi-disciplinary professional partnerships. Yet these losses pale beside what Lord Mackay won. It might not seem so. His main victory  giving courtroom rights to most solicitors  has been slow in coming. It will be a few more years before any of them set foot in court. But enter court they will  eventually  the judiciary. Because of him all lawyers can advertise and talk with the press. They are also open to unprecedented scrutiny. Equally profound is his establishment of a permanent advisory committee  with a majority of non-lawyers  to formulate policies on educating and training lawyers. True  giving these judges such prominence also makes them more publicly accountable. The advisory committee  he says  is """"the machinery of continuing reform"""". Such institutional mechanisms are the stuff of lasting change. Many of the goals once sought by radical reformers are now within reach. Chief among these is the merger of barristers and solicitors into a single profession  which is happening already by stealth: the ranks of barristers employed by businesses is growing; the number of solicitors appearing in court will do the same when City firms are asked by big clients  as they will be  even thrive  as top litigators do in America. The merger should be sped along by relaxing restrictions and  eventually  forging a unified legal-training system. Partnerships between lawyers and other professions should be allowed. Lord Mackay claims he never expected all the ideas in the green papers to be adopted immediately. But insiders say the drubbing he took from his peers left him deeply dispirited. The rumour mill grinds out gossip that he will soon go. He denies it. It is to be hoped that he is telling the truth. Much remains to do. COSTS  M'LUD? At the turn of the century Max Weber observed that in England  justice turned on class. It still does. Britain has far less litigation than America  but going to court in London is costlier than it is in Los Angeles. In America contingency fees gives access to the courts to those who could not otherwise afford a lawyer. In Britain this falls to a public legal-aid scheme: a plaintiff whose disposable income and capital are below certain limits can apply for aid; if his claim is thought worthy  its cost  L760m ($1.4 billion) last year  has more than doubled since 1986. Second  the proportion of people eligible for aid has shrunk  according to some estimates  from 70% to 40%. The great middle  neither rich nor poor enough to afford a lawyer  is growing. Thus is legal aid Lord Mackay's new firestorm. Keen to control its costs  he has floated some controversial ideas: pay flat fees to solicitors in criminal cases  require most civil legal-aid recipients to pay some of their own fees. All have raised howls of protest from lawyers. They say such cost controls will compel an already dwindling number of solicitors to give up legal-aid work. Rubbish  who cites statistics showing the number of solicitors' firms earning L120 000 a year or more from legal aid has quadrupled since 1984. The civil legal-aid system is a perfect target for Lord Mackay: inefficient  demand-led but producer-run  rife with vested interests. It deserves to be shaken to its core. The best idea on offer is a """"contingency"""" legal-aid fund  should they win  back into the fund. That money is then used to subsidise other cases. So long as cases are checked  as now  to weed out likely losers  the scheme should be self-financing. But even such a radical solution will not solve the whole problem. Millions of middle-class Britons will still fear the potentially ruinous costs of their legal system. That is not an entirely bad thing. Making losers pay winners' legal fees serves a purpose by deterring frivolous litigation. But as any barrister will attest  it also deters legitimate claims by those who cannot afford the risk  however small There is an answer  one which also has the word """"contingency"""" in it: contingency fees. The mere mention of it is enough to make many British lawyers wince. Lord Mackay flirted with the idea  and rejected it. Instead he favours the """"conditional fees"""" used in Scotland  not a percentage of the damages. Lord Mackay says there should be a small """"uplift"""" to compensate the lawyer for his risk--of  say  10% of the total fee. Few lawyers would take that paltry bait. And if they did  it is unlikely they would then offer to pay the other side's legal bill if their clients lost. Such arrangements might prove rare anyway  but that is no reason to oppose contingent fees. Even if a plaintiff had to risk covering the other side's costs  some suggest a bigger uplift--of  say  100%. Few are bolder. They look to America and think they see contingent fees degrading professionalism and turning litigation into a lottery. Yet if they understood the true strengths of their own system  British lawyers would realise that it is not contingency fees that are the problem in America. It is the unpredictability of the legal system  which distorts the incentive effects of contingency fees. In Britain--where awards are lower and consistent  where a small bar means lawyers' reputations matter more--contingency fees would not make much mischief. If they did  lawyers would have only themselves to blame. A society in which all human and social problems were regarded as apt for legal remedy would not be one in which we would find it agreeable to live."""" So stated the British Royal Commission on Legal Services in 1979. The conclusion is unexceptionable  but unenlightening. Which problems should fall to the law? Which should not? And who decides? These are political questions  not legal ones  sometimes violent. As the world grows richer and more democratic  people turn increasingly to the law to sort out conflicts: no place is getting less litigious. In the sweep of history this is  to say the least  a positive development. But not one without costs  monetary and human. The desire to cut these has led to the Big Idea set to dominate legal-reform agendas into the next century: alternative dispute resolution  ADR dispenses with formality and cumbersome procedures and aims to settle cases faster than  normal courts. Typically ADR is administered through private arbitration or mediation services. It is catching on. America's biggest """"rent-a-judge"""" company  in California  handles 30 000 cases a year; the membership of Britain's 18-month old Centre for Dispute Resolution includes many of the country's biggest companies; arbitration clauses in contracts are a commonplace. ADR is no magic solution. In some of its forms it is as expensive as traditional litigation. Nor is it clearly benign. Rich litigants and big companies are influential constituencies for much-needed reforms in court systems around the world. As they switch to ADR  there is a risk that valuable democratic institutions will erode further  not unlike what has happened to America's public schools. Yet there is something powerful about ADR. Like no-fault insurance schemes  worker's compensation and other bold  if flawed  ADR tries to conjure a world where costs can be cut without people having to sacrifice their own interests. It tries  in the words of the 18th-century Norwiegans who first dreamed up courts of conciliation  to offer access to justice without """"the gluttony of lawyers"""". In the years ahead  as lawyers are pressed to lose the worst of their many bad habits  that ambition may become less fanciful. END OF A GUILDED AGE I dined at my Lord Chancellor's  where three Serjeants at Law told their stories  how long they had detained their clients in tedious processes by tricks John Evelyn scribbled those words into his diary in 1686. Back then  the Almighty had an inside scoop: Evelyn's diaries were not published for decades. Today thousands of New Yorkers can pick up the Observer  a weekly newspaper I have two expensive houses  three expensive cars and two daughters who came out as debutantes with expensive balls. As long as I go home with a lot of money in my pocket  that's all I care about. The law is no more an ass now than it was 300 years ago. It is just less able to keep its venalities (and worse) a secret. Alan Dershowitz  a flashy Harvard professor and avocat celeb  calls it the end of the legal profession's """"Wizard of Oz syndrome"""". As the doings of lawyers have become more visible  the rhetoric of professionalism is ever more hollow. Too often lawyers have used their professional status simply to protect their privileges. Lawyers' guild-like pressure groups  known politely as professional organisations--the ABA  the Law Society  an American sociologist: """"Professionals differ from trade unions only in their sanctimoniousness."""" To varying degrees  public scrutiny and competition are imposing on lawyers a more demanding definition of professionalism: one dealing not with privileges  but with obligations. This is not necessarily idealistic stuff. In America  not long ago  could never have afforded such help. The law becoming a business will have its ugly side; but more often it will bring an emphasis on efficiency and service  two elements essential to professionalism. It may even lead to more--perhaps to lawyers trying to minimise the costs of litigation  or to avoid it in the first place. A handful of the best attorneys are doing this already. No sudden surge of altruism lies behind it. Rather  as clients grow more sophisticated  while at the same time some lawyers are realising that professionalism can be a selling point: best practice as good business. Less remunerative obligations will be accepted less graciously. In two rare shows of selflessness  the ABA and Nichibenren are thinking of requiring their members to do some pro bono  public-service work each year. """"Lawyers won't do it on their own  """"so they must be forced."""" It is not exactly what Roscoe Pound had in mind. But it is a start."""

He may hire others to do parts of the work  or even sell parts (and the proceeds) outright. But in the end it is he who generates the money  and picks up the profit. Hence the throng of promoters  and the battles for control. Ownership of a tournament--or a place in a baseball league--is a valuable asset. Rivals are to be fought off  or brought in only at a price. That is why big agents have extended into promotion  in golf and tennis  the professionals banded together to join in it  using their solidarity as players to stop others muscling in.

He may hire others to do parts of the work  or even sell parts (and the proceeds) outright. But in the end it is he who generates the money  and picks up the profit. Hence the throng of promoters  and the battles for control. Ownership of a tournament--or a place in a baseball league--is a valuable asset. Rivals are to be fought off or brought in only at a price. That is why big agents have extended into promotion  and why  the professionals banded together to join in it  using their solidarity as players to stop others muscling in. Offer what prizes you like  you will not get far if the new event you plan clashes with one on the tour run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Sport's grandest events are still run by the traditional bodies: the roc  FIFE national football associations and the like. Wimbledon still belongs to what used to be a suburban tennis and croquet club; it and the other three grand-slam events (American  French and Australian) still come under the International Tennis Federation. The us Golf Association runs the US Open. But the real power in many sports is in commercial hands. Tennis saw years of strife before the ATP in 1990 won effective control--a control which some overworked top players now find too effective. Formula 1 racing was wrested from FISA  an old-style ruling body  by FOCA  led by the formidable Bernie Ecclestone. Its American equivalent has been seized by a body now cheerily brand-named IndyCar  the Indianapolis 500 itself being the one event that it has not yet taken a grip on. North America's four top sports are run by the leagues of team-owners. In European football  UEFA has kept its club cups on top only by concessions to the big national club-owners  who were talking of a European super-league of their own. There are good reasons for all this. Money talks: Mr Packer could defy the cricket authorities because he offered players sums then unheard of in that ill-paid sport. More than that  moneymen get things done. The Louis Vuitton Cup  the contest that selected Il Moro to challenge for the America's Cup  run by the San Diego yacht club. Athletics is the prime case. Many criticise the businessmen now at its head  Was it better off in the days when runners scrounged bus tickets to get to the meeting? No such penury today. It costs Andreas Brugger  promoter of the Zurich Weltklasse  the leading commercially run event in athletics  including hefty appearance money. Other sports spend more. A golf tournament costs $1-1/2m-2m to run. Sponsors should cover that  while tickets  hospitality tents and TV rights provide prizes on top (from $300 000 to $1m; $1.8m in last year's Dunhill Cup  an international team contest) and profit. A top show-jumping event costs even more to run  though the prize-money is usually less; say $250  000 (but $700 000 in all at Calgary last year). Football is cheaper. The promoter of an out-of-season cross-frontier friendly may pay a modest $500 000--a fifth of it for the stadium and publicity  the rest to hire two top teams--and can hope for $150  though  and a three-week circus like the cyclists' Giro d'Italia over $8m. The main promoters  though  are those who  week out  have costly stadiums to fill and/or teams to pay. The secret is intensity off Twickenham  the temple of English rugby  amortised long since  last season saw a mere 16 matches  with total gates of $13-1/2m. Few can afford life that easy. Its soccer equivalent  Wembley  today is home also to London's American-football team. In San Francisco  that game's 49ers share the stadium that the baseball Giants want to quit. Ice-hockey and basketball teams often share  as in Chicago. Milan's two big football clubs share its San Siro stadium. As well as top-level rugby and soccer  Paris's national stadium  the Parc des Princes  a television station  has welcomed boxers  cyclists  horses  politicians  pop stars and a pope. No modern stadium would find that cost-meeting mix unusual. Few  though  can match the Tokyo Dome  a rooted stadium completed in 1988  which is hired--notably by the baseballers of the Yomiuri Giants--on 90% of the available days. Teams are a harder case: footballers cannot diversify into baseball. But here too there is an answer  and it is not just to make them play more often. Renter Silvio Berlusconi  owner not only of three television channels but of AC Milan. THE WEAKEST TO THE WALL One of Mr Berlusconi's secrets as a club-owner is simple: be top. His team did him proud last season  heading the Italian soccer league undefeated. The other is less obvious: synergy. AC Milan fills screens for the Berlusconi TV channels. They publicise AC Milan--not alone  of course  or commentator  is unlikely to give the team less than its due. Invest in ever better players--its Italians apart  the club has three of the stars of the Dutch national side--and you will get even more bums on San Siro seats  more profitable access to pan-European competitions  more viewers for Berlusconi television. And so on. The scheme is not infallible. Paramount Communications owns a New York basketball team  a hockey team  their Madison Square Garden stadium and a local cable station; yet neither the Knicks nor the Rangers flourished last year. But  the money spiral can goon up and up. As it does  real dangers to sport arise. In sport  nothing succeeds like success. Or fails like failure  witness the third-rank European soccer clubs that lose support  and so sink deeper still. So be it  one might say  that is the market  But sport is a peculiar market. Its players are entirely mobile. Its customers are not  The finest players in America would not bring the Milwaukee Brewers the same gate receipts as the New York Yankees enjoy (and even in America gate-money  boosted by other stadium sales  outruns media receipts in all four big sports). Likewise  nothing can make the Brewers' $3-1/2m a year of local television revenue match the Yankees' $50m. So be it  one might still say: sure  big-market teams can always outbid  small-market ones  but so can any big-market service-supplier. You expect grand opera in Corleone? TRUE  but La Scala  Milan  for all its riches  is sport commerce and nothing more. It embodies local culture and local pride. Yet  as the cost of players soars  the gap between rich teams and poor is growing wider  and the finances of the poor teams are turning red. Giant-killers do arise  at least in knockout contests (Mr Berlusconi dislikes knockouts). A small-city side took the Italian cup this year. But it was the first in 18 years. Too many teams  in most sports  live off wealthy owners or their companies. Even in soccer-mad Spain  the champion club  made an operating loss of more than $3m last year  while two first-division clubs (and another this year) were relegated to a lower level because of their debts. In Brazil some clubs can afford good players only by selling an arm or a leg in them to private investors. Of America's 26 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams  a third are up for sale. Sports rules do not help. When Japanese investors bid for Seattle's baseball team  other MLB owners held up the deal (baseball is """"a national institution""""  as the Japanese say when Hawaiians do too well at sumo). NFL rules prevent American Football teams being corporately owned; the league fined the owner of the San Francisco 49ers for trying (though it turns a blind eye on the small company that owns Wisconsin's Green Bay Packers). Not that wise investors would rush in. True  PSV Eindhoven  is part of the Philips electronics empire. But one quoted British soccer club had recently to be rescued  and an attempt to float Hamburg's club on the stockmarket flopped. An odd sort of business  sports business. SQUEEZE OR SHARE Just as odd are the differing attitudes across the Atlantic to the rich-get-richer syndrome that could kill top-level sport outside top-level cities. Supposedly cartel-loving Europe mostly lets competition rip; in free-enterprise America  each helps each. Europe's frontiers are the one real protection for its minor clubs. They produce a series of small goldfish bowls  well-stocked (a typical national league has 18-20 clubs  as against 26-28 for all America) and each with its national cups and its own big fish. Leagues limit how many foreigners a club can hire. EC labour laws are opening that barrier  in practice  rich Italian clubs such as AC Milan or its local rival  Internazionale  cannot simply skim off all of Europe's stars. Nor are there supranational leagues (though the biggest of the Euro-cups is being redesigned much like one). There is some revenue-sharing  notably of TV rights. But it is resented: the reason England's top 22 soccer clubs broke away into a Premier League of their own was mainly to stop lesser fry sharing so much of the television loot--and even then the top six clubs wanted to grab more still. In Europe  the devil takes the hindmost. Not in America. In football and basketball  the draft a complex system of recruiting top college players for the big teams--is so set up that the worst teams get the first  pick. That is no small privilege: basketballers like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson in the 1980s came straight from the draft to turn their limping clubs--and sport--into winners. Each league has a company to sell merchandising rights. Caps with one club's logo may for outsell another's  but the profits are shared equally. So  more significantly  less so for the Bears returning the visit. Basketball even has an egalitarian salary-capping scheme. Players' pay  collectively  may not exceed 53% of total NBA revenues  to allow a modest average salary of $1.1m. Even so  the baseball owners at least would like something of the sort. Well they might. Baseball has an arbitration system--a """"stupid"""" system  says the league's commissioner  Fay Vincent--to fix pay when a club and its tied player cannot agree. And  the arbitrator cannot take local market conditions into account: a good pitcher in Milwaukee deserves as much as a good pitcher in New York. Not that the Brewers should complain: they were hurling money at pitchers last season  including one four-year contract for $13m  and little so for but an injury to show for it--an anecdote that speaks volumes about baseball's finance. Little wonder that in 1991  as recession bit  its average salaries were up 51% in a single year. Yet still owners come: the Japanese paid $75m in Seattle (for a 49% share  in the end  to keep the stars and stripes nominally flying). Two new teams  will pay $95m apiece to join MLB next year. The next football owners to join the NFL could pay up to $200m. American sport is riding an exponential spending curve that mayor may not be matched by receipts. If not  no amount of share-and-share-alike will save lesser clubs  any more than in weakest-to-the-wall Europe. THE LABOURER'S HIRE Tom Kite this spring became the first golfer to win more than $7m in his career. Big money. Yet seven IndyCar drivers have done it. Leave aside his winnings on the senior golf circuit  Arnold Palmer earns over $7m each year in product endorsement and appearance fees. Several American team-game stars get $4m-5-1/2m in basic pay. And (unless his failure in America's pre-Olympic trials has hit fees) Carl Lewis can earn $5 000 each second that he sprints. Too bad it is not in marathons. Of all the money hurled at sport  a surprisingly large share does get through to the players. Many of the figures are gee-whizz  some--like that one for Mr Lewis--more genial than informative. But used with due care  they are also revealing. They reveal a world turned upside down since 1970--for the stars. Their on-the-field pay and prizes have swelled. Their new sources of income off it have burst through the roof. Yet for some professionals life has barely changed. And in most sports women are still the poor relations. The figures reveal too a few sports still stuck almost in the pay-scales of the past  by choice (rugby)  or because of their format (cricket)  or just new agents. Or leaving alone? Here are some figures  and some contrasts. Inflation falsifies them  but not enough to matter. In the late 1950s  Jack Brabham had a retainer of L10 a year ($28 at the time) to drive  and win  amateur--Wimbledon took home L2 000 ($4 800 then). In 1980 he got L20 000; last year L240 0 Women had to wait till this year's Wimbledon to reach L240 000. In the American Open  men and women are equal. Sponsors and advertisers think so too especially if the women look good: ask Longines  Bayban  Seibu  Pepsi  Fuji  Seat  Aerolineas Argentinas and others who enrich Gabriela Sabatini each year by about $5m. Women compete  and earn  on equal terms with men in show-jumping. In tennis  skiing and  for some  athletics  they run men close. But they are way behind in golf (where men hit farther  not better)  and in America's ten-pin bowling (where men have no advantage at all). In their few professional team sports  women's pay is dwarfed by men's. Yet do not weep for Leanne Barrette  1991's top-earning lady bowler  whose $87  in most sports  would jump at that. While the stars' agents negotiate tat appearance fees  the average competitor in a good British athletics event will get maybe $150  out of the British Athletics Federation's princely purse of $900 000 for all meetings. The journeyman golf-club pro is little better off than in 1970; ditto the third-division footballer. Back at the top  the money  and the ways of getting it  say  a glove-manufacturer as official supplier to the tournament  and the firm pays the golfers  supposedly for wearing its gloves. Or  simpler  the prize money extends to the umpteenth on the list. Or  simpler still  the money passes unseen For the stars  though  that is just an aperitif Even genuine prizes are an hors d'oeuvre. The real gains come from sponsorship. Miss Sabatini's yearly off-court earnings outrun her lifetime on-court winnings. Such imbalance is common enough. The Brazilian javelin-thrower whose federation objected to her posing for Playboy had a fair answer: the magazine paid her In big-league sports  pay has soared. America's basketball and baseball (another 21% up this year) are neck and neck at an average $1.1m; football pays $425 000; ice hockey $350  plus four-year contracts of around $9m. Again  remember the other side. Of tens of thousands on athletics scholarships  only a handful will make the big league. The rest? Well  and an education--of a sort: in football  of those who entered college in 1986  only 57% had graduated 5-1/2 years later. Even that was a big improvement on what used to happen. Europe's top pay is far behind  nearer the $1.5m of Japan's top baseballer  Hiromitsu Ochiai  an unamazing English footballer has joined Sampdoria  a Genoa club  on $775 000--huge money in Britain. Bonuses can be big: Johan Cruyff  a former Dutch star who now manages Barcelona  for $1.7m a year  was promised an extra $650 000 if the club beat Sampdoria to lift this year's European Cup. (It did.) The owner of Atletico Madrid offered his lads a Rolls-Royce apiece if they won the Spanish league. (They didn't.) America's players also do better when they change clubs. Its free-agent system broadly leaves a player his own master as his contract ends. Although players may be swapped  they are not  normally  European soccer has a busy transfer market. The money goes from the player's new club not to him but to his old one. These are Europe's gee-whiz numbers. The record transfer foe is $14m  paid in 1990 between two Italian clubs. Far bigger was the cash-plus-players deal which--despite demonstrations by weeping tans has just taken Gianluca Vialli from Sampdoria to Juventus  of Turin. That deal is put at $21m-25m. I SAY  OLD CHAP How different is the officially amateur world of rugby. Hushed tones tell of the English club that persuaded players from others to join it for $20 0  of the wicked French who almost openly pay such sums 000 a year. This cannot last. Outside Britain  few people care much for rugby's virginity  certainly leading players. International rugby has won big audiences. The broadcasters are not yet paying accordingly  but they will  and the rewards will reach the players. Cricket is a harder case. Its class distinctions-there used to be an annual match of Gentlemen (amateurs)v Players (pros)--vanished long ago. But a sport whose top (""""test"""") matches last five days will never be a natural for TV. Even the modified one-day version lasts all day. No one will make fortunes here. An English county side that won one of last year's one-day trophies picked up just $47 000; an award for the test-match """"player of the year"""" was $9 000. No wonder youngsters in the West Indies  are discovering baseball. Perhaps cricket  geographically spread worldwide  should return spiritually to its roots. In the English county of Hampshire lies Broadhalfpenny Down  the first recorded  that was old before the United States was born. On grounds like that  any summer weekend in this one county  you can see 50 of 60 inter-village or local-club matches. They last from after lunch till dusk. None of the few spectators  the umpires and players  aged 13 to 60  pays or earns a penny. Very odd  any good agent would think. THE GREASERS OF THE WAYS Mark McCormack is a sports agent. So is Donald Dell  a former Davis Cup player for America. So is Alan Pascoe  once a British Olympic hurdler. So now is Jean-Claude Killy  once billed as """"renaissance man"""" by the kind of magazine that uses such billings. So  no less  is Jon Smith  who used to promote pop records. ISL is a sports agency. Andy Norman  """"promotions officer"""" of the British Athletics Federation  is not an agent at all  but still one of Europe's leading deal-fixers. It takes all kinds to make their world  the unseen side of sports. And three qualities. First  an ability to spot an opportunity  to sell and sell  like any agent. Third  and less usual  a readiness to be denounced  not just by the media  but sometimes by the people you are selling for  as a corrupter  an exploiter  a parasite  barely short of a crook. Few people in sport have to take such a hammering as sports agents. Most of it is nonsense. Their main crime is to have done their job well (and  yes  it can be done badly: two subsidiaries of big advertising agencies made a fine mess  of the earliest promotion of the Barcelona Olympics). Their job is to multiply the money flowing into sport and sportsmen. Some critics think that is corrupting in itself. The agents do the job in many ways. They negotiate on behalf of players with sponsors and event promoters: Mr McCormack's IMG  the granddaddy of the agency world  is famous for the flock of golfers and tennis-players on its books (not to say under its wing  and sometimes promote events themselves. They may also act on behalf of sponsors. They market events  to sponsors  broadcasters and the public. They do public relations. They may represent television commentators (or indeed be commentators: Desmond Lynam  who fronts BBC sports programmes  is also one half of a small agency that acts for sponsors). They may produce and sell TV programmes. Those who act for players may find that this includes arranging a babyminder while Daddy wins the Open  hiring people to design golf courses or clubs in his name  and then advising him how to invest the proceeds. Minus their own cut  that is. For agents take a hefty cut on all this  or a direct profit when  they are promoting or selling rights on their own account. That is where the cries of exploitation arise. No matter that the money might not exist but for his agent  some player will always feel that somehow he could do better still. Then there may be a bust-up  as in Ivan Lendl's lawyer-enriching break with Mr Dell's ProServ in 1988. A more solid charge is that the many hats worn by big agents like IMG create conflicts of interest. Will a player's agent twist an event-promoter's arm on his behalf  if he is also linked to the promoter  or is indeed the promoter himself? The short  answer is  if you don't like him  don't use him. Of the ten top-earning golfers listed earlier  four (all European) are IMG clients; of the top ten in tennis  six. Presumably all 20 are tolerably content. The opposite charge too is made  that the agent/promoter may favour his own stable. IMG has to face sniping aimed at the (now Toyota) World Matchplay Championship  which it created and runs at Wentworth  as last year  the winner is called Ballesteros (who is not an IMG client)  and the """"unknown""""--actually winner of two American tournaments last summer--wallops Ian Woosnam 7 and 6  perhaps this is not the time to argue that the public is being conned. Similar questions are asked about television. IMG produces thousands of hours of sports programmes  notably for British satellite TV. Do """"its"""" players get undue camera time? When it shoots West Indian cricket  for whose ruling body it acts--or when the TV arm of Mr Pascoe's agency  films sports with which its sponsorship arm is concerned--are they utterly impartial? Who knows? But then who cares? When was any sports broadcast utterly impartial? There are real issues in all this  but also an overdose of purism--or envy. Among the event promoters  some complain of the agents' grip on players. Some rights-sellers reckon they can """"do better ourselves"""". UEFA arguing its plans for a restyled European Cup  clear thinks that agents cream off more than they should. An apt comment on that is FIFA's World Cup television deal. It itself sold the 1990  $78m a throw  looked good at the time. It looks a giveaway today. Agents' foes can range from 15% to 30% of a player's earnings. They take 10-25% in sales of rights. Here an agent may act purely as such; or  for a higher commission  share the risk by guaranteeing a minimum to the promoter; or buy outright. Big sales  earn it """"well under 20%""""  the IOC says. IMG AND THE REST Whatever the means  the results are impressive. IMG  with 1  claims a turnover of $800m. Fees from players (with names like Navratilova  Seles  Courier  Lendl  Senna. Schumacher  Tomba  Faldo  Woosnam and  still  Palmer) account for 30-35%. Yachtsmen will swell that list: IMG is close to a new organisation of match-racing sailors  as ProServ was to the tennis men's infant ATP in the 1970s. Another 30-35% of turnover comes from events. IMG owns several golf tournaments  including a super-rich winter jamboree in Jamaica  backed by Johnnie Walker whisky. With a leading French rider  it last year launched the show-jumpers' Paris Masters. The rest of INC's money comes from television. No other agency is nearly as large  and few as many-sided. ProServ specialises in tennis (Sabatini is one of its names). Mr Stein's Telemundi  based in Monaco  whose latest big deal was outside sport  selling sponsorship for this year's Seville Expo. Media links help. APA  multi-functional and middle-sized  is now part of Aegis  Europe's biggest media-buying group. Conversely  the Amaury group  publishers of L'Equipe  Europe's best sports daily  which created the Tour de France in 1903 and still runs it and other cycling events  has just set up an events-promotion company  headed by Mr Killy. For all its growth  sports agency still has room for the free-spirited entrepreneur. One such is  corporately  Mr Smith these days flogs the shirts  tracksuits  shoes  bodies  heads and indeed mouths of players. These have included many of England's football team  and Diego Maradona  the most famous footballer of his day. Cricketers too  though  as Mr Smith admits  the best agent can make few bricks when there is not much straw: England's 1990 World Cup footballers earned about L30 000 ($54 000) a man from commercial activities  their 1992 cricket equivalents only L4 0 Mr Smith promotes football matches: things like Arsenal v Indipendiente  of Buenos Aires  played in Florida in 1989  at a time when the Jaruzelski regime was short of foreign exchange. He used to own part of the London Monarchs American-football team. He has a nice house  nice wife  several acres  a Rolls-Royce  a pair each of children  horses and llamas; and the money to maintain them. Above all  you feel  he has fun. Even now  sport is not just another business. For assurance that business it is  visit ISL  Horst Dassler's creation. It is big  depending what events are on when. It is focused. ISL sticks to marketing. It does not run events  nor act as consultant for would be sponsors  though it does not rule these out. What it will never do  says its chief executive  Brian McGrath  is represent players. ISL claims no skills in happy changing or share-spotting  and wants none; nor the risk of conflicts of interest. With Dassler five years dead  ISL today is also distinctly corporate  in a trade where personal chemistry counts for much. It is backed by Dentsu  and with other Swiss-based bodies such as FIFA UEFA and the show-jumpers' FEI Its deal to market the Olympics survived rival bids  including one from INC. Old links with athletics are reflected in its marketing of IAAF events. There is juicy business here  business that others drool for. Sports politics helped to win it. Sports politics will help to decide whether ISL retains it. MEET THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES The book was over the top. So was the reaction to it of Juan Antonio Samaranch  president of the IOC and of Primo Nebiolo  his equivalent at IAAF. If the two British journalists who wrote """"The Lords of the Rings"""" have now joined the ranks of sport's big earners The public should thank all four. Between them  this spring they brought life to a subject  top-level sports politics  and the puff about """"Olympism""""  international goodwill and other unlikely philosophies  lie big-money businesses. Messrs Samaranch and Nebiolo and  to a less extent  FIFA's Joao Havelange--are the men who have made them so. The three are easy to knock. They are old--72  69 and 76 respectively. Famously ambitious  they are now as famously autocratic. They do not disdain flattery: IOC literature likes to label Mr Samaranch """"His Excellency"""" (he was once an ambassador). They have not chosen all their allies or the financiers of their sports with kid gloves. The empires they have built spend money as if it flowed from pitchers  Manchester  no spendthrift  will lay out $10-1/2m bidding for the games of 2000--and it has seven rivals. All this and more is detailed savagely in """"The Lords of the Rings""""*; unfairly and untruly  reply its targets. Yet even were it all true  the money is there. It was not once. The IAAF and FIFA--even  if less so  1974 and 1980). The IAAF had $200 000 a year to spend. Today it has $40m-50m  thanks to sponsorship and soaring TV revenues ($91m from Europe for 1992-95  $20m from Japan  with America still to be negotiated). The IOC over 1989-92 will rake in $930m from TV rights for this year's two games  plus $710m from sponsorship. Of the latter  only $175m comes from its own global TOP (""""the Olympic programme"""") sales  the rest being raised and spent locally by the two games' organising committees. But count that in  as the IOC fairly does  add other income  and the total is $1.8 billion  $450m a year. Nor does the money all go in glossy limos for officials (Mercedes supplies those at IOC headquarters anyway). The Olympics are seriously run (even if Albertville did chill some television enthusiasts' dreams of a single games scattered over the globe). The IAAF runs 60-odd events each year. FIFA puts money into various levels of football worldwide. In sundry ways  some of the new flood of riches at the top is trickling down to the grass roots. STRANGE MULTINATIONALS So  whatever else  the three grandees run effective businesses. Yet strange ones these are. They have """"subsidiaries-their equivalents at national level but little formal grip on them. National athletics  FIFA and the like existed or not. The IOC is more strongly placed: national Olympic committees exist only to serve the games. But think of those games as what in a sense they are  giant four-yearly trade fairs  and the IOC's weakness is apparent. It runs the fairs  and crowds they draw. But all the exhibits  the athletes  come from outside  the national committees  which in turn depend on national """"suppliers"""" of the sports concerned. Then think of the money  the IOC's $450m a year. Who would not like a bit of that? By comparison  the IAAF with its $40m-50m is poor  from TV rights and sponsors such as Panasonic  the Post Office and Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph. What would you expect in  say  the fast-food market from figures like this? National Olympic committees cannot break loose. They are like franchised outlets  and has won well-paying global sponsors (well-content ones too: of nine 1988 TOP sponsors  eight bought for 1992  and four new ones came in) National committees; though  lose sales opportunities. True  they get some compensation: of the TOP cash  50% goes to the games' organising committees  7% to the IOC  43% to national committees. Fine for poor countries. Rich ones like America  though it gets 20%  grumble noisily. Other bodies can do more than grumble. If your farmers' cooperative raised most of Big Mac's beef  it might cross your minds to set up a burger plant  find a brand name  you would warn McDonald's to pay more  or else. In essence  the IAAF is doing both. It has a well-filled programme of meetings  headed by week-long World Championships for what amount to national teams. Not unlike some other games  are they? And since last year these  are due every second year 1991  1993 and so on. Already they draw good TV revenue--and the supply of that is not inexhaustible. The IOC is also being invited to pay up. Money from its network TV rights now goes 76% to the organising committee of the games concerned  8% to national committees  8% to itself. Just 8% goes to the world federations whose sports supply its athletes. Not enough  who heads not only the IAAF but a joint council of those federations. How wise was Mr Samaranch this spring to exercise a new presidential privilege and--motu propio  said a grateful IAAF hand-out  a phrase more often used of popes--award Mr Nebiolo what he had coveted for years Whether Mr Nebiolo's gratitude will soften his approach remains to be seen. And there is a catch for him too  as in most markets that look neatly sewn up. What if the farmers in your co-op start asking for more individually? A burr plant at least supplies burgers. World bodies like the IAAF supply nothing: athletes in the Olympics or its own meetings come  when not on their own account In sum  the great Olympic """"movement""""  the happy """"family"""" of sport  the row over """"The Lords of the Rings"""" would be a storm in a champagne glass. RICHER AND BETTER Yet does sport gain from all this money? Or lose? When you have seen the French national rugby team on song  inspired by Serge Blanco  you have seen magic. Watch Germany's soccer players scythe away at their opponents' legs  and you see sport at its grubbiest. What you are seeing  surely  is the difference between amateur (even top-level rugby still is  in a way) and professional  the proof of money's corrupting power  right? Actually  no. On a less tuneful day last winter  you could have seen an English player crashing foully into Mr Blanco--and still more lawlessly felled by half-a-dozen French fists. As for soccer scythes  it is over 25 years since the World Cup match  when Brazil's legendary Pele was cut off at the knees; yet in those clays the rewards of victory  even for top professionals  were barely worth cheating for. Sport is tough today  and money does play its part in that  but then so is lid. The case against sports money  often heard  is far from made. Yes  sport is in some ways sick. It is infected with drugs--but their best-own users  the East Germans  not cash. (One cannot be so sure of the Americans.) It has caught the legal virus: absurdly over the America's Cup in the late 1980s  dangerously in the way that any drugs finding against a top athlete today arouses talk of writs  based  often  on the threat to his commercial earnings. And sport would not test LAW-positive if the lawyers-after-wealth did not sniff plenty of wealth around. But that is not sport's fault. Soccer hooliganism is new  but the rioters are not interested in cash--or indeed  except that it provides their excuse  in soccer either. Is the play on court worse because Wimbledon's hospitality tents are stuffed with corporate guests guzzling smoked salmon? Or cricketers less skilled because they play some games under floodlights in coloured pyjamas? The Olympics may reek of money  chauvinism and empty parade  but the all-amateur Berlin Olympics of 1936 reeked of parades much nastier than that. True  sport shares out its money with wild unevenness. But  to be shared at all  money has to exist. Would equality of poverty be preferable? One may pine for the mucky old North Bank terraces at Arsenal. One may prefer Hampshire's village cricket to a test match at Lords. But the reality is that today's money-driven sports are taster  higher and stronger than ever before. That is what top-level sport is about. Even if the genie of money could be put back in his bottle  let us admit that sport would be worse off if he were. * By Vyv Simson and Andrew Jennings. Simon and Shuster; L14.99 and $25."""

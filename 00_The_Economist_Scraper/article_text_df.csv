America was entering a recession, and bank failures were much in the news. The Uruguay round of trade talks had collapsed and the prospect of a trade war looked all too plausible. Worst of all, a real bombs-and-bullets war was about to be fought in the region that supplies most of the world's oil. Parallels with the 1930s came readily to mind.
In the past 12 months none of those nightmares came true. The war against Iraq was over in weeks, and the third great oil-price shock never happened. America's recession proved to be one of the shallowest in its history, and the country's banking system began to repair itself. The Uruguay round restarted, and moved to within inches of a trade-reform package that will be well worth the wait. Is the world celebrating? It is not. If anything, the gloom seems deeper now than it was a year ago.
This is partly because new risks to the world economy have appeared, and partly because old risks, no loner set beside imminent horrors such as war in the Middle East, loom larger. In America, however, the loom has at least as much to do with the electoral cycle. George Bush and his administration are frightened because the pre-election boom that would keep them in office has failed to appear. Shallow or not, recession has not turned into recovery. Their panic over this is increasingly public. Voters--witness recent surveys of consumer confidence--are easily infected by it, which will make the White House panic all the more. A self-fulfilling mood of depression seems to be in place, and not just in America. All over the world, it has become the single biggest threat to jobs and living standards during the year ahead.
Look beyond the next few months--as if no big elections were in the offing--and thins look different. Short-termism is always a hazard in economic policy, but never more than in 1992, when matters of great long-term significance for the world economy will be decided. Awkward though it may be for office-seekers, this is a good time to think about priorities, and to separate imaginary risks from real.
NONE SO BLIND
A catalogue of current misery is easily put together. Recovery has stalled in America. Vigorous growth in Japan and Germany, which had buoyed the world economy until recently, is slowing sharply. Corporate and personal indebtedness remains at historically high levels in many countries. Business and consumer confidence, having recovered since last summer, is slumping again. America's Federal Reserve talks of an unprecedented credit crunch, as banks reduce their lending and borrowers their demand for loans, despite the lowest interest rates for more than 20 years. Fiscal reflation offers no escape: America's budget deficit is already too big to be safely made any bigger.
These worries cannot be waved away--but nor should they be exaggerated. Start with America. It would be folly to expect, or wish for, a surging recovery from what was an unusually tame recession. In the downturn of 1973-75 output fell by 4.1% from peak to trough, and unemployment rose to 9% of the labour force. In 1981-82 output fell by 2.8%, and the unemployment rate rose to 11%. In 1990-91 the fall in output was just 1.6%, and the unemployment rate rose only to 7$. The current recovery cannot be both strong and non-inflationary, simply because there is so little to recover from. Now, misguided disappointment at weak growth in the second half of 1991--echoed in cries of grief from the White House--has itself become an additional brake on the economy.
The slowdowns in Germany and Japan are real enough, but largely deliberate and largely desirable. Both economies had been overheating. Japan grew by 5.6% in 1990 and 6.6% (at an annual rate) in the first half of 1991; western Germany grew at 4.5% and 5.2%. With no margin of spare capacity, inflation was drifting up, especially in Germany. Monetary policies were adjusted accordingly: short-term interest rates were pushed higher in 1990 and the first half of 1991. As a result, in 1992 both countries should see moderate growth, of between 2% and 2-1/2%, with slowing inflation.
This international mixture of moderating growth and sluggish recovery might be all right as a rule, it is argued, but what makes it worrying just now is the fragility of the financial system. Consumers are so burdened with debt that the combination of lower inflation and lower interest rates--the principal engine of recovery--will fail to spur output. This is indeed a danger; but, again, it is exaggerated. The financial liberalisation of the 1980s allowed people to borrow more, but everywhere they accumulated assets as well, usually at a faster rate. Even in America, where consumers piled up debt so eagerly, net financial wealth kept pace with incomes during the past decade.
In their most recent forecasts, economists at the OECD agreed that, because of debt, consumers may take longer than usual to respond to falling inflation and interest rates. Allowing for this and other risks, they still concluded, conservatively, that the industrial economies will grow by more than 2% in 1992, with inflation of less than 4%. That may not be startlingly good, but it is a long way short of disaster.
The immediate outlook is undeniably murky. But the duty of policy-makers at such times is to avoid hasty remedies that only cause more harm later. Above all, governments need to remember that monetary policy works with a lag, and that its primary job should be to achieve price stability in the medium term. In recent months short-term interest rates have fallen in both Japan and America. The full effects of that easing have not yet fed through, which is why many in the financial markets regarded the most recent cuts in the central banks' discount rates, to 3.5% in America and 4.5% in Japan, as driven more by politics than by prudence. Even if that is unfair, such talk should be a matter of great concern to the central banks. In their business, credibility is everything.
If governments are reluctant to think about macroeconomic policy in a medium-term context, it is not entirely their fault. Economics has taught them the illusory pleasures of fine-tuning, and has led them to neglect policies better designed to promote long-term growth (see pages 15-18). Nowhere is this neglect clearer than in the continuing saga of the Uruguay round of trade talks.
Within reach is a package of trade reforms that would raise real incomes everywhere--not least in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where difficult reforms will prove impossible without rapid integration, through trade, with the West. The gains would not just be for this year or next. Freer trade would spur investment and innovation worldwide. In all likelihood, it would therefore induce a permanent increase in global economic growth. This enormous prize is there for the taking. Yet trade ministers are permitted to squabble on, while presidents and prime ministers tear their hair about the latest batch of statistics.
Governments should look at it this way: the Uruguay round is a vote-winner. A deal, which requires a willingness in Europe and America to compromise on farm protection, would bolster confidence and investment, adding to growth in 1992. If the round is allowed to collapse after all, that further blow to confidence might precipitate the very slump that governments dread. Attention short-termists: think trade."

What is the point of an experiment in democracy if the first people it delivers to power are intent on dismantling it? That is the question to be asked about Algeria after its parliamentary election on December 26th. The sag in support for the National Liberation Front was no surprise: after 30 years in power the FLN had long since run out of ideas. But the extent of its collapse, and of the gains made by the Islamic opposition, was remarkable. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) won 188 seats; the FLN WOn 15. If the Islamists do equally well in the election's second round on January 16th, they may head the next government. Not bad for a party only three years old, whose top men spent polling day in prison.
A lot of people--in France as well as Algeria--have been quick to take fright. Listen to what the victors say and it is indeed possible to imagine a new Iran casting its shadow over the western Mediterranean. Some FIS people hope to transform Algeria into an Islamic state, make the Koran its constitution, expel women from work and hide them behind the veil, introduce sharia law and ban usury. That sort of Algeria could be an awkward neighbour, and a miserable place to live in. But, on at least two counts, the comparison to Iran is misleading. It conceals big Islamic differences between the countries: a Shia tradition with a formal clergy in Iran; a gentler Sunni tradition in North Africa. It also overlooks the different circumstances in which the two Islamic governments will have come to power.
THE LUXURY OF TIME
Islamic Iran emerged from a violent explosion. Algeria's election was part of a controlled experiment that has not yet blown up, and still has the potential to succeed. The experimenter-in-chief is President Chadli Benjedid. One of the FLN's anciens combattants, he won his elections unopposed, when Algeria was still a one-party state. But he is a Gorbachev, not a shah. He has tried to revive Algeria's stricken economy by liberalising trade, credit and foreign investment. And, since the murderous bread riots of 1988, his political reforms have been as bold as his economic ones. First came the legalisation of opposition parties, then--after several false starts--the current parliamentary election. If all goes as planned, the president's own job will be filled by a free election in 1993.
It is the gradualness of this transition that gives grounds for optimism. No matter how well the FIS does in the second round, it is unlikely to inherit power immediately. Even if its leader, Abbasi Madani, is conveyed directly from his prison cell to the prime ministership, he will still have to brace himself for a spell of cohabitation with Mr Chadli. Although cohabitation will be tense, it does not have to be disastrous.
Mr Chadli has already been careful to put a distance between himself and the FLN. On some issues, moreover, the president and the Islamists are closer than they suppose. The FIS's horror of socialism will encourage it to support many of Mr Chadli's economic reforms. Its hostility to western culture may be little stronger than that of the FLN, which has gone through its own bouts of stamping out French and promoting Arabic. As for banning alcohol and veiling women, the FIS has learnt, since its local-government victories of 1990, the need to proceed with caution. It knows that a lot of Algerians who voted for it did so out of contempt For the old rulers, not because of a hatred of modern life. To win the big prize, the presidency, the FIS will need to use the period of cohabitation to persuade Algerians that a vote for the Islamists does not mean swapping one sort of tyranny for another.
Having won power through the ballot box, would the fundamentalists ever surrender it that way? Nobody really knows. Like other Islamic parties in the Arab world, the FIS's leaders see democracy as a means to an end-the creation of an Islamic state--rather than as a system to be valued for itself. The point to remember is that the Arab governments that oppose such parties are no democrats either. Algeria's government, the first with the courage to put its fate in the hands of the people, should see the experiment through."

Now you have an idea what it feels like to be Boris Yeltsin. It is scary. But it is also commendable. A bold lurch to liberty is the best way--perhaps the only way--of escaping the 74-year disaster of Soviet communism.
The gathering fashion is to be appalled at what is now happening in the ex-Soviet Union. But it is worth remembering what those 74 years involved. Under Lenin and Stalin there was revolution, civil war, mass expropriation of property, mass collectivisation of farming, mass famine, mass murder, the displacement of people en masse, the gulag. Khrushchev and Brezhnev softened the dictatorship but enthusiastically raped the environment and revved up the machine of mass destruction. The Gorbachev years brought political light but the economic gloom of a hyperinflationary slump. How could the escape from the system that produced such a catalogue of calamity be anything but daunting and dangerous?
The miracle is that, so far, it has been so peaceful. Whether or not the new Commonwealth of Independent States is destined to last (see page 39), it has already provided a mechanism for the controlled dissolution of the Soviet Union. Mr Gorbachev helped by agreeing to go quietly. The new ""nuclear states"" (Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia and Kazakhstan) seem to have responded to the main worry of the West, that there should be a single command over the ex-Soviet nuclear arsenal. The Commonwealth's leaders also agreed this week to let its members have their own armies if they want them.
So the Soviet empire has been dismantled, its ruling party has been overthrown and its great army is being divided up--all with the minimum of fuss. As yet the only bursts of violence have been in places where blood had already been shed. Armenians and Azeris have resumed their fight over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. And in Tbilisi, the battle to oust Georgia's elected dictator, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, has intensified almost into civil war.
Many people fear that Mr Yeltsin, too, could become an elected dictator. They point to his bullying manner, to his evident love of power, to the way he has compelled other republics to follow his reform agenda. Yet he deserves the benefit of the doubt, not only for what he has already achieved (the small matter of ending communism), but also for what he is trying to do now. Mr Gorbachev discovered to his cost that economic reform cannot come through the compromise of committee, or without the authority needed to persuade people to accept the initial pain involved. With the stature that comes from being an elected president and popular hero, Mr Yeltsin has moved to fill a leadership vacuum, launching the sort of full-blooded economic reform from which Mr Gorbachev flinched.
On January 2nd most prices in Russia were freed, and an ambitious programme of privatisation was launched. If anything, taking responsibility for such shock therapy required more courage than leading the resistance to last August's attempted coup. The hope is that Russia can follow Poland's example, survive the treatment and within a matter of months emerge visibly healthier, even if a full cure takes years.
The fear is that so much could still go horribly wrong. Trouble in parts of the former empire is inevitable. It was no coincidence that the first region to flare up was the Transcaucasus, an area packed with ethnic enmity and now left without a Soviet army to impose some sort of order. A nasty upheaval is all too likely in the Central Asian republics, the third world of the former Soviet Union. These Islamic republics will have to cope with poverty, disease and assorted environmental disasters with far less, if any, of the subsidy from Moscow on which they have relied to scrape by.
Broad agreement on the command system for nuclear weapons has reduced the risk of a nuclear nightmare, but not eliminated it. As Edward Shevardnadze, the ex-Soviet foreign minister turned doomsayer, keeps reminding the world, weapons could still fall into rogue hands. The weapons themselves are only part of the problem. Already there are the first, tentative reports of attempts to sell nuclear raw materials. Relations between the two new giant states, Russia and Ukraine, are tense. A trade war is a grim possibility if their agendas for economic reform get badly out of phase. Given Ukraine's 12m-strong Russian minority and potential territorial disputes, a trade war could conceivably escalate into a real war.
BORIS THE BRAVE
In Russia itself, Mr Yeltsin's Big Bang risks blowing up in his face. It is easy to see how it could happen: prices soar, factories close and panicked Russians take to the streets demanding a restoration of order. What might happen next is less clear. Another military coup? Coup-minded generals may be even less capable of pulling it off than they were last time, and many of them will anyway want to avoid taking responsibility for the economic shambles. A populist dictatorship? Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a far-out fanatic whose proposed policies include blowing radioactive waste across the Lithuanian border to bring the Lithuanians to heel, won more than 6m votes in Russia's presidential election last June. Yet most Russians, even when desperate, do not want to be ruled by a lunatic.
The absence of obvious alternatives should give Mr Yeltsin a while to prove that his remedies can work. It would have been nice if he had been able to tackle each of the ex-Soviet mega-problems in turn--first attending to the economic crisis, then the military crisis, then the constitutional crisis--instead of facing them all at once. But the pace of events did not allow that luxury. Gorbachevian compromise has outlived its usefulness. Russia is lucky to have as its leader a man with plenty of the bravado that is now needed. Welcome to the roller-coaster."

For years it had inflation and interest rates well above those of its neighbours. A bad thing, X's businessmen and politicians agreed; how much better to find a way of matching the neighbours. Eventually, after many years of watching, X decided to copy what they did. In just 12 months its inflation rate had tumbled to within a whisker of the neighbourhood average. So had its short-term interest rates. Most remarkable of all, its long-term rate, which two years earlier had been 2-1/4 percentage points higher than that of the most enviable neighbour, was less than one point above it.
A triumph, surely? Outsiders thought so, until they heard the whines from some of X's citizens. Then they began to suspect X's mettle. It was behaving like a spoilt child, getting the toy it wanted but still stamping its foot. Perhaps X was not the place to invest their money. The more outsiders withdrew, the more likely it became that X would have to sacrifice either its new low inflation or its new low interest rates; even, conceivably, both. Yet the whining continued.
SOFT-OPTION LAND
Since country X is Britain, it is quite possible that its citizens will snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. On inflation and interest rates, they have done so many times before. This week, as sterling wobbled above its floor in the European monetary system, it was easy for journalists to find a Tory member of Parliament or some chief executive or a well-known professor to urge that the pound be devalued and interest rates cut. The purpose, rent-a-quote would proclaim, is to make British industry competitive and get it out of recession.
That is an excellent goal, but devaluation would not achieve it. Lowering the exchange rate gives only a brief boost to competitiveness, before domestic wages and import costs rise to inflate the advantage away. Britain's post-war history proves that, for otherwise today's pound, straining to reach DM2.85, would be much more competitive than it was 30 years ago, when it stood at DM11.20. Harold Wilson is rightly ridiculed for saying, in 1967, that ""the pound in your pocket"" was not being devalued when sterling's exchange rate was cut. It took a few years for companies and workers to prove him wrong; today it would take them just a few months.
So an EMS devaluation would provide no lasting benefit. What of the devaluers' other hope: that British interest rates could come down and stay down? Here, too, delusion abounds. If sterling were to be devalued, long-term interest rates would immediately rise, since bond markets would anticipate the higher inflation to come. True, short-term rates might be lower for a time. But all too soon, as higher British inflation threatened, the government would have to increase rates again--or let inflation rise still further.
The case for devaluation therefore boils down to buying some relief for a few months--and there lies the clue to Britain's current debate. An election must be held within a few months. British voters tell opinion pollsters that they are not keen on the Conservatives, but might change their mind if interest rates were lower. Hence the clamour for cheaper money from some Tory politicians, and from some newspapers that want a Tory victory at any price--often the same people who were quick to accuse Labour governments of manipulating the economy for political purposes.
As it happens, the best hope of getting both prizes--lower interest rates and lower inflation--is for Britons to stop whining. If the markets were convinced that sterling would never be devalued, the pound would quickly rise. Because it is still in a wide band in the EMS, it is one of the few European currencies on which sizeable exchange-rate gains can be made. It is therefore quite plausible to imagine a buy-sterling mood developing, which in time might give the government the chance to cut rates again. In how long a time? Perhaps a few months."

Bean-counters have always been thought boring; now, it seems, they are also bad--incompetent and, in some cases, corrupt. The immediate ailments are easy to spot. Spectacular collapses of firms like Polly Peck, BCCI, America's savings and loan associations, and the businesses run by the late Robert Maxwell, all just months after their auditors saw fit to bless their accounts, have raised big questions both about accounts and about those who audit them.
Blaming auditors is only partly fair, for investors expect far more of auditors than they are legally entitled to receive. In fact, unforeseen corporate tumbles are but the most obvious symptoms of a much bigger problem: that accountancy itself is in a muddle, producing company accounts that are often meaningless. An investor armed with the published accounts of a typical big firm is hard-pressed to tell if the firm's profits came from continuing businesses or from windfall gains, how much its assets are worth or what its debts are, and even if the firm is really profitable in an economic sense (ie, if it adds value with the resources it employs). Numbers exist for all these things, but what they mean is often unclear or impenetrable.
This muddle is not lost on accountancy's standard-setters, which in 1991 renewed efforts to make accounts more useful. America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and Britain's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) led the way, both introducing controversial but necessary new standards (see page 68). There were also stirrings in international bodies, and in Japan. Inevitably, reform is being resisted. But accountants must not let it lapse.
What needs to be done is clear and well understood--at least, it seems, by the FASB and ASB. If the numbers are to mean anything, assets and liabilities should be shown at current market values, regularly updated. A cash-flow figure should show whether more cash entered a firm during the year than left it. Debt and equity should be separated according to whether an instrument involves a claim on the firm regardless of its income (debt) or not (equity), not according to arcane legal definitions. Leasing arrangements, pensions and health-care schemes should be shown, fully valued, as liabilities if the firm is committed to making payments in future.
THE CHAIRMAN WILL NOW COME CLEAN
Profit figures would be made more useful by ending the pretence that one number can answer all questions about a firm's performance. As Britain's ASB proposed in December 1991, separate results should be shown for continuing, discontinued and acquired businesses. Firms also benefit when the value of the assets they hold (say, property) rises. So accounts should reveal both when the change in value occurs (even if it is not realised because the asset is not sold) and when the increase actually passes through the headline profit figure. And auditors should be allowed to require managers to comment publicly on unusual or controversial numbers. This would enable auditors to warn investors without having to take the drastic step of qualifying a firm's accounts.
Although accountancy's agenda is straightforward, implementing it is not. The cost of writing and auditing accounts could soar, reckon critics. And extra information could make accounts harder, not easier, to understand. This is a risk, but an avoidable one. The real worry for businesses is that showing meaningful numbers about a company may reveal the firm to be less healthy than the present numbers (which are easily manipulated) suggest. Banks, for instance, are likely to see big rises and falls in the value of their assets and liabilities from year to year if these are shown at current prices. The FASB's ruling in 1991 that firms make provisions to cover future healthcare costs has added billions of dollars to balance-sheet liabilities. Yet investors are most worried by nasty surprises; vague accounts make surprises likelier.
Accountants have a bad record at taking on their clients. In the 1970s, soaring inflation provided the impetus to introduce current-cost accounting (which ensures that asset values reflect today's prices, not the day before yesterday's); when inflation slowed, bean-counters stood by while firms dropped current-cost accounts as fast as they could. The impetus from today's scandals could be lost just as quickly. It is vital that it is not."

At the dawning of what promises to be the most momentous year since 1991, no one is going to be much concerned with Gorbyism, Thatcherism or Hawkism. Instead, the reporters' microphones will be prodding the faces of their successors. Yes, there will be the memoirs, to be rummaged through for indiscretions. There will be the freak show known as the lecture tour, with the television shadow-play made flesh for a voyeuristic audience. But the great ones' pronouncements are fated to go unheard. People want guides to the treacherous future, rather than accounts of the depressing past. Uncover the crystal ball, however cloudy. Past leaders are lost and soon forgotten.
It is all a bit cruel, being discarded like a toy whose clockwork no longer functions. The moment they are dumped they are cut off from the flow of state papers. No longer are they briefed by people who claim to know the origin of the dispute in Nagorno-Karabakh, and can explain it in two sentences. The wits who once gladdened their courts have found new public voices for their sound bites.
GIVE THEM A UNIFORM
World leaders used to die in office. Roosevelt, Mao, Stalin, Kennedy and Nehru did--and de Gaulle almost did. They departed in the traditional manner of monarchs: decisively round down or cut down. A few days of hypocrisy followed, and that was the end of them until they turned up in the history books. Today's lot still have life in them. They are a touch embarrassing, hanging about, their eyes alert for an autograph book, their hearts heavy with yearnings for paradise lost. They look so ordinary now, without the auras that go with power. Were these the lips once watched with such intent for clues to the nation's destiny?
Perhaps something is owed to the has-beens. Not a return to power. That game is over. Not the membership of some new think-tank. Perish the thought. But they have a value, if only to each other. What the old terrors do retain is an unmatched knowledge of the rascally world at the top. They have suffered, and inflicted suffering, in their daily combat with what they regarded as unimaginable evil at home and abroad. This is their bond. Vivienne Westwood, the fashion designer who has made bondage respectable, could design them a uniform. It would be as distinctive as the garments that bishops and judges wear on duty, and far more modern. A new suit, a new dress, is supposed to do wonders for morale.
They could wear it on Lost Leaders' Day, when they would be given a generous gulp of the oxygen of publicity. Nakasone of Japan would be there, and Lee of Singapore. Kaunda would turn up from Zambia, and be a little weepy. Ershad of Bangladesh might be allowed out of jail for the occasion. There would be Lange, the fat man from New Zealand, and Benazir, who loves a party. Their presence would be a jolly diversion at the increasing number of summits the world is threatened with. Long live the lost leaders. Today there are merely dozens. With countries dividing weekly like amoebas, there could soon be a cast of thousands."

Forecasters argue indefatigably about growth this year (even this quarter) and next. Economic advisers tell ministers that this tax cut or that increase in public spending will be good for growth. To some critics, indeed, the trouble with economics is precisely that its obsession with growth leaves issues such as sustainability out of account. True enough: economists are interested in growth. The trouble is that, even by their standards, they have been terribly ignorant about it. The depth of that ignorance has long been their best-kept secret.
What has kept it hidden is the distinction between short-term growth and long-term. To predict whether an economy's output will increase from one year to the next, no proper theory of growth is required--nor is one used. Economists look first at the gap between an economy's current output and its capacity for production, then at the forces (consumer confidence, the stockbuilding cycle, the state of other economies and what have you) that will affect this gap in the months ahead. Out of that comes a forecast of growth.
Such forecasts are informative enough to be taken seriously by governments and financial markets. But they merely predict fluctuations around a trend, in the course of one business cycle. For long-term forecasting--estimating how far output will increase from one decade to the next--this approach is no use, because what matters here is not the gap between output and capacity, but the long-term trend of capacity itself.
Why has growth in productivity slowed in America in the past two decades? Did the reforms of the Thatcher years raise Britain's long-term rate of growth? Why have the economies of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian dragons expanded at an astonishing pace in the past 40 years, while much of Africa has stagnated or declined? How long will the ex-communist countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union take to catch up with the West? To answer these questions needs something that economics has so far been unable to provide: an understanding of the forces that drive long-term growth.
Mainstream economics does have a theory of long-term growth. It was devised by Robert Solow, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the 1950's, and has been much modified and improved since then. But this so-called neoclassical theory is patently inadequate--so much so that its teachings have had virtually no influence on policy-makers. Only now are there signs of a change. The defects of the theory are the starting-point for new ideas which, with luck, may end the short-termism of economics and push long-term growth to the front of policy-makers' minds.
Assume better mousetraps
The heart of the neoclassical theory is an equation, called the production function, which says that the output of an economy depends on the amount of capital and labour employed. The theory also made some linked assumptions about this relationship. First, if you double the amount of both capital and labour, you will get twice as much output. This is the assumption of constant returns to scale. Second, if you add more capital to any given labour force, or more labour to any given stock of capital, you will get successively smaller increases in output: for each factor of production, holding the other fixed, there are diminishing returns.
These assumptions seemed plausible. Reassuringly, they were also consistent with the imagined world that economists call perfect competition. But they have a striking implication. In an economy where the stock of capital is rising faster than the labour force, the return to new investment (ie, to a further increase in the capital stock) should fall with time. For today's industrial countries, this has not happened: the returns to investment have been higher in the past few decades than they were in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
In the same way, the theory implies that poor countries should find it easy to grow much faster than rich ones: investment in a country with little capital should spur output more powerfully than a proportionate amount of investment in a country with plenty. Again, the facts do not bear this out. The chart shows (Chart omitted) how GDP per head grew between 1960 and 1985 in 114 countries, ranked (poor-to-rich, left-to-right) by their GDP per head at the start of the period. If poor countries had found it easier to grow faster than rich ones, the points on this scatter-graph would cluster along a downward-sloping line, from top left to bottom right. Take the Asian dragons and the rich countries alone, and that seems to be so. Add in the rest of the world, however, and the trend vanishes.
To both these difficulties, the neoclassical theory has an answer: technological progress. Though returns diminish as more capital is added to the economy, that effect is offset by the flow of new technology. This could explain why rates of return have stayed high in the industrial countries and, arguably, why most poor countries have not grown faster than rich ones.
Yet the theory still looks odd. For instance, it implies that a sustained increase in investment will not, of itself, raise an economy's long-term rate of growth. As the capital stock grows, more of each year's investment must be set aside to replace old machines as they wear out. An increase in investment, says the theory, will cause the capital stock to grow--but only until investment is again exactly sufficient to hold the amount of capital steady. So a permanent increase in investment--say, from 10% of GDP to 12% of GDP each year--will cause only a transitory increase in the capital stock, and hence in output. Ultimately, therefore, technological progress, not investment, is the engine of growth.
That makes it crucial to understand what technological progress is, and how it happens (we shall print an article on that next week). Neoclassical theory has no convincing answer. It supposes, in effect, that new technologies rain down from heaven as random scientific breakthroughs. In statistical terms, technological progress is simply ""the residual""--the thing that accounts for any growth that cannot be accounted for in other ways. When economists apply the theory to real economies, they get a poor fit. Typically, studies find that increases in capital and labour account for half or less of the growth in output. The rest is put down to technological progress or, as the residual is also known, ""total factor productivity"". The neoclassical theory can explain only half of what it purports to explain.
The endogenous innovator
For 30 years the larger part of economic growth was thus consigned to a black box; the best that mainstream economics could do was to offer a choice of fancy labels for it. Outside the mainstream, and in a disconnected way, economists worked for years on how to look inside the box and make sense of the contents. Only recently have these strands of work begun to be drawn together into a radically new theory of growth.
With hindsight, intellectual historians will probably date the revival of growth theory to 1983 and a University of Chicago doctoral thesis entitled ""Dynamic Competitive Equilibria with Externalities, Increasing Returns and Unbounded Growth"". Its author was Paul Romer, now a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Since then, he and a growing band of economists have built parts of a theory that seems likely to fit the facts. The work is still providing as many new questions as answers to old ones, but the outline of the next orthodoxy is now discernible.
Recall that the neoclassical theory takes into account just two factors of production: capital and labour. In effect, Mr Romer and his colleagues add another: knowledge. This makes the theoretical production function much more plausible, in several ways.
First, the new theory recognises that knowledge (eg, about how to make things) can raise the return on investment. This accounts for the evidence on rates of return over time, and the non-convergence of growth rates among countries. Second, whereas in the neoclassical theory technological progress just happens, in the new theory knowledge is a factor of production which, like capital, has to be paid for by forgoing current consumption. Economies have to invest in knowledge in the same way that they invest in machines. Third, since past investment in capital may make it more profitable to accumulate knowledge, the new theory admits the possibility of a virtuous circle in which investment spurs knowledge and knowledge spurs investment. This in turn implies that a sustained increase in investment can permanently raise a country's growth rate--an idea that the traditional theory denied.
In short, the new theory is capable of explaining the world as it actually is. In his most recent work, Mr Romer has elaborated it, to take four factors of production into account: capital, unskilled labour, human capital (measured by years of education, for instance) and ideas (which might be measured by patents). Not everyone thinks that an improvement. But whether with three factors or four, Mr Romer's theory has one most uncomfortable consequence. It is flatly inconsistent with the idea of perfect competition--the theoretical underpinning not just of the neoclassical theory of growth but of a good part of modern economics. No wonder the old theory, despite its obvious drawbacks, survived so long.
Why is the new theory inconsistent with perfect competition? Because perfect competition means that firms are price-takers: they accept the price that rules in the market and cannot change it. Under constant returns to scale, as assumed by the old theory, this can be so. If firms cut their prices to win a bigger share of the market, they achieve no further economies of scale and therefore risk losing money.
With three (or more) factors, the assumption of constant returns to scale no longer stands up. Taking all the factors together, the production function shows increasing returns: if you double all the factors, output more than doubles. In this theoretical world, firms can cut prices, raise output and--thanks to lower costs--make a bigger profit than before. With increasing returns, therefore, competition is imperfect--another way of saying that firms are price-setters, not price-takers. This change may seem insignificant. In fact it turns economic theory inside out.
Despite that, Mr Romer's approach is likely to form the basis of mainstream thinking on growth during the coming years. Many recent advances in economic theory have started from, or ended up at, the idea of imperfect competition. This is partly because economists now have the mathematical techniques that are needed to explore it. Abandoning the assumption of perfect competition no longer means abandoning most formal analysis of economic systems. In this respect, the new growth theory is in tune with the times. The new theory is attractive in another way too. Because it simply brings new factors into the neoclassical production function, it can be seen--despite its far-reaching implications--as an extension of the existing orthodoxy. That makes it easier to digest.
Don't patch it up, chuck it out
If Mr Romer's approach is to be the new orthodoxy, its principal challenger will probably be a theory developed by Maurice Scott, of Nuffield College, Oxford. Though appealing, his theory is less digestible. The differences between the two shed light on the questions that the new generation of growth theorists will have to grapple with.
Mr Scott agrees that the neoclassical production function is no use. But rather than modify it, he wants to abandon it entirely. The core of his argument echoes an old debate in economics. He says that the measure of capital that appears in the production function is fundamentally incorrect.
The production function is concerned with the change in the net stock of capital--ie, with gross investment less depreciation. This implies that depreciation is a physical process that reduces the productivity of capital; as it were, a reduction in the number of machines in the economy. Wrong, says Mr Scott. Machines that are properly maintained can run at their designed capacity for years--long after the production function regards them as having evaporated. That is why some economists prefer a different measure of change, gross investment less scrapping. Wrong again, says Mr Scott. Machines are mostly scrapped when they become profitless. They may still be making things, but they are not adding to net output. So no productive capital is lost when they are scrapped.
This suggests that simple gross investment, without deductions, is the best measure of change in the capital stock. Yes--but there is a problem, says Mr Scott. It does not follow, as you might think, that the sum of all past gross investment provides a good measure of the stock, because there is no way of knowing how much each bit of old capital is contributing to total output. Regrettably, the idea of a production function that links the level of output to the level of capital must be abandoned. The best one can do is use changes in capital--gross investment--to explain changes in output.
Like Mr Romer, Mr Scott regards technological progress as crucial for understanding growth. In his theory, though, technological progress does not appear as a separate influence: he treats gross investment and technological progress as one and the same thing. At first sight, this view may seem puzzling, but there is plenty of evidence to support it. In a classic study, ""Invention and Economic Growth"", Jacob Schmookler analysed nearly 1,000 major inventions in four industries (farming, railways, oil-refining and paper-making) around the world between 1800 and 1957. Where a stimulus for the invention could be identified, it was in nearly every case an economic one (ie, the invention was needed for some industrial purpose); in not a single case was the stimulus a particular scientific discovery.
Clearly, scientific progress broadens the possibilities for useful innovation. But the evidence suggests that, as Mr Scott says, ""inventions are motivated and caused by similar factors to those which cause investment, that is, by their expected profitability"". Innovation does not pour down from heaven, as in the neoclassical world. Nor is technological progress, or ""knowledge"", a commodity distinct from new capital, one that has to be separately invested in, as in the Romer models. Knowledge and investment, Mr Scott argues, are inextricably bundled up together.
In his most recent work, Mr Romer, in contrast, insists that the analytical effort of separating the two is worthwhile. Why have decades of heavy investment yielded so little in India and so much in South Korea and Taiwan? Perhaps because India's investment happened behind trade and foreign-investment barriers that kept out knowledge of new techniques and products, whereas the dragons' investment was mixed with a copious supply of new ideas. If nothing else, the debate over the new growth theories has revealed how bad economists have been at thinking about the national and global transmission of economic knowledge--production methods, designs for products and other forms of intellectual property.
Pure and applied
Much of the new work on growth has so far been abstract and theoretical; non-economists can fairly wonder whether the effort will prove worthwhile. It will. Already the new growth theory is yielding results.
Studies by Robert Barro, of Harvard University, and others have used Mr Romer's approach in empirical studies that compare growth rates in many different countries. In statistical terms, the approach seems to work. In economic terms, its results are striking: lack of human capital (ie, education), not lack of investment in physical capital, is what prevents poor countries from catching up with rich ones. In a similar vein, Daniel Cohen, of CEPREMAP in Paris, has estimated feasible long-term growth rates for the reforming economies of Eastern Europe (where standards of education are comparatively high); he arrived at growth rates of income per person that ranged between 3% and 3.5% a year.
Richard Baldwin, of Columbia University, has used a Romer model to estimate the effects of the EC's single-market programme on growth. Traditional growth theory simply could not address such a question: it contained no mechanism by which trade liberalisation (or indeed anything but ""technological progress"") could raise the long-term rate of growth. In the Romer framework, trade liberalisation is likely (though not certain) to raise the long-term rate of growth, by stimulating investment. The European Commission's Cecchini report concluded that the 1992 programme would raise the EC's output once and for all by between 2.5% and 6.5%, with no permanent effect on growth. Using the Romer framework, Mr Baldwin predicted not only a bigger one-off gain but also a permanent increase in the annual growth rate, of 0.25-0.9 of a percentage point.
As such studies multiply, the value of the new growth theory will become clearer. But it is to be hoped that its biggest effect will be to reorder the economic-policy agenda. This is influenced more than most politicians would admit by debates that they barely understand--witness Keynes and demand management after 1945, or Milton Friedman and the monetarism of the 1970s. The new growth theory confirms that governments are mistaken to concentrate so exclusively on the business cycle. If, however indirectly, it leads them instead to think harder about education, investment, research and development, trade reform, intellectual-property rights and so on, it will be a breakthrough indeed.
Paul Romer's recent articles include ""Endogenous Technical Change"" (Journal of Political Economy, 1990) and ""Are Nonconvexities Important For Understanding Growth?"" (American Economic Review, 1990). Maurice Scott explains his theory in ""A New View of Economic Growth"" (Oxford University Press, 1989) and in ""Four Lectures"" (World Bank Discussion Paper 131, 1991)."

Needing to seem less preoccupied with foreign affairs, but having no domestic initiative to offer, George Bush has redefined the recession as a trade issue and set off on a two-week tour of Asia to complain about barriers to American exports. The consultants who dreamed this up must be congratulating themselves. Never mind that it stems from some mercantilist nonsense borrowed from the Democratic Party.
The presidential trip--to Australia, Singapore and South Korea and culminating on January 7th with a visit to Japan--was planned long ago and was to be brimming with goodwill towards Pacific nations. These, Mr Bush has long rightly recognised, are quickly becoming America's most vital trading partners. Yet first the Gulf war and then an autumn panic about the American economy delayed the tour. Now its purpose has been hijacked by that domestic panic. Out has gone the goodwill; in comes a jingoistic brand of economic crusading. And look who the infidel is: that trusty villain Japan, now being blamed for the American recession by Americans who ought to know better.
In case Mr Bush should forget these flawed lines, a chorus of American businessmen has been brought along to echo them. On January 7th they will all complain loudly about Japan's closed markets and the harm they are causing valiant American exporters. Closed markets there are aplenty in Japan. But the 21 hand-picked executives could hardly be a less comely bunch to deliver this hissogram. For they represent much that is wrong with American business.
Many are yesterday's men, such as Lee Iacocca of Chrysler, from yesterday's companies (the other two heads of Detroit's Big Three are also present). Most pay themselves munificently--on average, six times more than their Japanese equivalents and 100-plus times more than their own employees--come good times or bad. Mr Iacocca himself (1991 salary: $4.65m, excluding stock options) never misses an opportunity to insist that Japan has a God-given duty to dig Detroit out of its giant hole (1991 losses: $6 billion) by buying more American cars. He is calling for fresh restrictions to prevent Americans from buying the Japanese cars they want.
The irony is not lost on the Japanese. They shun American cars for much the same reason as many Americans do: the cars are not the best for the buck. Certainly, unnecessarily stringent certification procedures help to keep imported cars from Japan, but Japanese consumers still buy plenty of European cars. Last Sunday on an NBC talkshow Japan's deputy foreign minister, Koji Watanabe, was asked what the Japanese could learn from American car-makers. He was stumped for an answer.
Fair play it isn't
All this palaver matters because it is suddenly fashionable again in Washington to be a protectionist. Of course, you will call yourself a ""fair trader"". But discrimination is America's only implied problem, and retaliation its only implied response, whatever that might cost the American consumer. A trade deficit is taken as conclusive proof of ""unfairness"".
This stand is to be expected from old protectionists like Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader and a gofer for the American car industry. Before Christmas Mr Gephardt introduced in Congress a bill that would restrict imports of Japanese cars if America's $40 billion merchandise-trade deficit with Japan did not shrink to under $5 billion by 1997.
It is quite another thing to hear the outgoing commerce secretary, Robert Mosbacher, join in. He was on the same NBC talk show as the Japanese minister, along with John Dingell, a Democratic congressman from Detroit who has done much to hinder American business and would love to do the same to Japan. Mr Dingell said flatly that Japan, by blocking American exports, had caused America's current recession. Mr Mosbacher, pressed on the same point, seemed to agree, though not ""totally"". Mr Mosbacher also mentioned the possibility of restricting Japanese car imports. The Japanese embassy pronounced itself outraged at the recession slur.
Mr Mosbacher will now head Mr Bush's re-election campaign, so more criticism of Japan will flow from him if that is what opinion polls seem to dictate. At least his tenure at the Commerce Department had the advantage of being relatively low-key. It is uncertain whether his successor, Barbara Franklin, a management consultant, will follow a more activist course. But Mr Bush, if he is pushed in an election year to start bashing the Japanese, could smother his better instincts.
If the result were simply lower import barriers in Japan, fine. But the rumours already spilling from the Japanese government suggest otherwise. Various possible appeasement measures include fresh voluntary export restraints for America-bound cars, and tax subsidies for those at home who buy foreign ones. Such a return to more managed trade would benefit only those bureaucrats from whose regulatory grip so much Japanese business has escaped in the past 10-15 years.
Intellectual deficit
This current bout of American protectionism is different from previous recent ones in that the current-account deficit has been shrinking for four years. In nominal terms the current-account deficit peaked at $162 billion, or 3.6% of GNP in 1987. Since then it has fallen sharply, due mostly to an improvement in the merchandise trade balance (see chart) (Chart omitted). In 1990 the current-account deficit was $97 billion, or 1.8% of GNP. The deficit in 1991 will be only about $4 billion, thanks in part to foreign contributions towards the cost of the Gulf war; but thanks also to record volumes of exports, despite a slowing world economy.
Although this means that America now runs a trade surplus with Europe, its deficit with Japan remains above $40 billion a year and will probably rise soon. True, nearly two-thirds of that deficit is accounted for by car imports into America. But that does not mean that Japan's car industry should be singled out for special ""blame"". Americans buy two-fifths more cars than they produce, whereas the Japanese buy cars equivalent to half their production. Why? Because Japan has a comparative advantage in making cars.
Not every Washington economist preaches managed trade. This week Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics argued that Mr Bush should be seeking from the Japanese a promise of domestic fiscal expansion and a revaluation of the yen, which Mr Bergsten reckons is presently 15-20% undervalued. Such a plan presupposes that unpegged currencies are controllable, through international cooperation which may be a little wishful.
Rather than worry about Japan's problems, Mr Bush would do better to dwell upon his own country's. The current-account deficit is unlikely to shrink further. The Gulf war dividend will not be repeated. And as America's petrified economy comes back to life, so it will suck in imports. Once again, an untackled budget deficit will weigh heavily upon America's external accounts, with or without a deficit with Japan. Mr Bush could usefully remind himself of one thing while abroad. The economy really does begin at home."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224176243/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/9?accountid=14657,"Everybody knows that one of the American economy's most urgent problems is the woeful lack of investment in it, right? Not necessarily. In the last article he wrote before he died on December 28th, Warren Brookes, a columnist with the Washington Times, poured cold water on that fashionable gloom.
Mr Brookes's contention was that the decline in America's investment rate over the past decade is illusory. True, in nominal terms, gross investment fell from around 18% of GNP in 1978 to just 14% in 1990, according to the Commerce Department. But those nominal figures ignore the revolution in information technology over that period. The real cost of computing power has fallen by 99% since 1980, and it continues to fall by around 30% a year. This, in turn, has helped depress the real price of producing capital goods, as computing power takes the place of human brain and brawn. The result may have been private investment rates, adjusted for inflation, every bit as good during the 1980s as during previous decades.
The counterpart to this, however, is that human labour has become less valued vis-a-vis computing power--witness the proposed 74,000 lay-offs at General Motors, and a threatened shake-out in practically every corner of the service industries. This has relevance for Washington politicians. For one of the main arguments put forward for reviving the investment-tax credit (ITC, abolished in 1986) is its revivifyng effect upon employment.
Unfazed, George Bush is almost certain this month to announce an administration proposal for just such a credit. It would get bipartisan support in Congress. A full restoration of a 10% ITC would cost the Treasury some $30 billion-50 billion a year in forgone revenues. Such a sum (equivalent to about a tenth of the current federal budget deficit) may be too much for the administration to stomach. So Mr Bush is likely to propose a ""targeted"" ITC. This means that the tax deduction would be confined to investment over and above a company's existing plans--however such a figure is calculated. The credit would apply only to ""productive"" investment, that is, not to purchases of new office furniture and the like. And it would run only for a specified period, probably one year.
Such a targeted credit might cost $15 billion-20 billion in lost revenues. As such, it would be a smallish boost to the deficit. Yet the introduction of an ITC risks opening the door to all sorts of other interests demanding their right to qualify for the ITC or any other kind of tax break. Solving this problem, after all, was a force behind the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which abolished the ITC and many other privileges.
Moreover, whatever its size, the same objections apply to a new ITC as to all the previous ones, imposed by other administrations. Bribing investment does not ensure that such investment is productive (no more than investing in information technology). And, most important, investment through ITCS translates into costs born by taxpayers--or investment forgone elsewhere."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224166091/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/10?accountid=14657,"Open many big-city newspapers in America and you are likely to find the same features: sports scores, horoscopes, mayoral pronouncements and, around this time of year, an article announcing that the city has once again broken its record for the numbers of murders committed in a year.
In 1991 grim records of this sort were set across the country. Washington, DC, recorded 490 murders, up from 483 the previous year. Dallas easily broke its record, with 485 by December 27th, up from 433 in 1990. Other big cities like San Diego, Milwaukee and Phoenix also set new marks.
Many cities that did not actually break their records still suffered more murders in 1991 than in 1990: Baltimore, Chicago, Miami and Houston fell in this category. Los Angeles exceeded its 1990 figure of 983 murders and, with 1,006 killings notched up by December 21st, seemed poised to break its 1980 record of 1,024. The murder championship is, however, likely to be retained by Washington, which once again had the highest per-capita murder rate in America--78 for every 100,000 residents. St Louis is the runner-up. A few cities saw their murder rates decline, Philadelphia and Boston among them.
Those looking for comfort could point to the fact that the murder rate is no longer rising as fast as it once was. Although the overall murder figure for America in 1991 will not be finally arrived at for some months, the widely accepted estimate of 23,700 killings would mean an increase of only 300 from 1990. (That gives a national murder rate of 95 per million people per year; for comparison, the murder rate in Britain was 4.5 per million in 1990.)
But while the murder rates in large cities seem to be dwindling slowly or remaining stable (albeit at shockingly high rates), the picture has worsened dramatically in some smaller towns. Youngstown, Ohio, which has a population of 96,000, had recorded 58 murders by December 27th--almost triple the figure for the previous year. In Anchorage, in Alaska, there were 25 murders in 1991--an increase of 150%. In both cities, the sudden upsurge in homicide was directly related to the arrival of large amounts of crack-cocaine on city streets, repeating a pattern already experienced in larger urban areas. Washington, for example, recorded its biggest upsurge in murders between 1987 (228 murders) and 1989 (439) as crack was spreading.
When Washington's murder rate was rising, some criminologists theorised that it was the result of a struggle for control of the city's drug trade. They noted that in cities like Chicago, where single gangs tended to dominate the trade in relatively well-demarcated areas, murder rates remained lower and more stable. Such a theory led some to hope that once the crack trade had settled down, the murder rate would actually decline in cities like Washington. But this does not seem to have happened--instead it has simply stabilised at a new, higher level. Of late, the police in Washington have noticed that a decreasing proportion of murders seem to be directly related to the drug trade. More and more are simply the results of disputes over trivial matters between people who are now used to carrying--and using--guns.
A recent report by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which called America the ""most violent and self-destructive nation on earth"", noted that violent crime in America had increased by 516% since 1960, while the country's population had increased by just 41%. Yet most streets in most cities remain pretty safe. The soaring murder rate affects inner cities and the young blacks who live there to a wildly disproportionate extent. A recent study by the Centres for Disease Control concluded that young, black men are more than seven times as likely to be murdered as young, white men."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224169139/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/11?accountid=14657,"""We're gonna have some fun,"" Walter Hickel proclaimed to a cheering crowd after winning the race for governor of Alaska in 1990. A year later his mood is more aptly depicted by a recent cartoon in an Anchorage newspaper. It shows a bandaged, dizzy Mr Hickel, his rumpled T-shirt bearing the plaintive slogan, ""Are we having fun yet?""
Indeed, it has been a rocky ride for the 72-year-old Mr Hickel, who first governed Alaska as a Republican in 1966, went on to be interior secretary in the Nixon cabinet and returned to the governor's mansion in 1990 as a third-party candidate. He has made enemies by trying to cut social spending and has antagonised native tribes by ignoring their demands. His $1.1 billion settlement with Exxon for the Valdez disaster was widely dismissed as a sell-out. His scheme for reapportioning legislative districts has ended up in the courts. And he narrowly averted impeachment over a scandal involving his 12% stake in a company proposing to build an $11 billion natural gas pipeline from northern Alaska to Valdez.
Disillusionment with the governor has spread even to his erstwhile supporters. In April his own party--the Alaskan Independence Party--joined a campaign to recall (dismiss) Mr Hickel, claiming that his last-minute nomination to the party ticket in September 1990 was illegal.
But the defining struggle of Mr Hickel's administration is over how best to use Alaska's fabulous wealth of natural resources. It was in his first term that Alaska first struck it rich in the Prudhoe Bay oil fields. Taking 25 cents from every dollar the oil companies make, Alaska has established a fund of more than $10.9 billion. As a result it is the least-taxed state in the country, with no sales tax, no income tax, and an annual cheque sent to every man, woman and child in the state. This year each cheque was $931.34.
The idea of another ""Big Score"" seems to transfix Mr Hickel. His grandiose proposals have included water pipelines to California, a huge deep-water port--even a polar road to Norway. But Prudhoe Bay was almost certainly a one-off. Mr Hickel's hints that drilling for oil in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) would mean a second Prudhoe, were misleading. Not only is there far less oil under the remote wildlife refuge, but it is federal property, making it unlikely that Alaska would have been able to shake down oil firms for much money. The proposed gas pipeline would also probably fall short of expectations.
The Senate's decision to put off legislation allowing drilling in ANWR for at least a year was a triumph for greens, who had made the refuge a cause ce'le'bre. But having repulsed Mr Hickel's assault on ANWR, they now face commando raids across the state. Mr Hickel's administration is trying to ease water-quality guidelines for timber and mining companies; to use an obscure statute to turn long-unused sledge dog trails into roads; and to divert road-maintenance funds to build a controversial road along the Copper River to the town of Cordova.
Greens cite the Cordova road as typical of Mr Hickel's irresponsibility. The governor sent in the bulldozers virtually in secret last summer, and 40 of the 82 miles between Cordova and Chitina, where the road now ends, were punched through before winter set in. Meanwhile, the project enraged fishermen because silt from the construction work muddied the Copper River, which breeds salmon so prized that they are sold under the river's name, like Perrier. And greens feared that if Mr Hickel succeeded in Cordova he would be emboldened to start roads elsewhere--perhaps through national parks and refuges.
Mr Hickel insists that big capital projects will ensure the state's prosperity by opening the vast hinterland to development. But greens, and plenty of economists, have a different vision based on Alaska's enormous wealth in fishing, tourism and sustainable forestry. All three could be damaged by expanded logging, mining and drilling. But to Mr Hickel, economic development means one thing: construction.
Mr Hickel claims to speak for all Alaskans. But his support is actually razor-thin. Only one in every six adult Alaskans voted for him in 1990, a percentage well below the 20-30% of the residents who habitually express strong disapproval of him in polls. While the attempt to dismiss him was initially launched by fringe members of a fringe party founded in 1974 with secession as its goal, it has now gained some mainstream support.
Still, Mr Hickel has shown an ability to confound his green critics. As interior secretary he cracked down on oil companies after the Santa Barbara spill in 1968. More recently, his Alaskan administration has backed a plan to bring order to the free-for-all that now passes for a commercial fishing season in Alaska. Nevertheless, Mr Hickel sees himself as a man with vision for Alaska, and concrete and steel are what give it form. The battle for whose vision wins, say greens and Mr Hickel alike, is barely under way."

The result is a lively market for the artificial insemination of would-be mothers with sperm from anonymous donors, who produce semen on demand for doctors engaged in the lucrative fertility industry. The donor's fee for this service is typically $25-50 per ejaculation.
At least one fertility specialist, however, has allegedly widened his profit margin and kept this modest sum for himself by using his own sperm without informing his clients. For this departure from normal ethical practice, Cecil Jacobson (now of Provo, Utah) stands indicted by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, on multiple charges of criminal fraud.
The indictment stems from investigators' reports that Dr Jacobson, a former George Washington University professor, sired ""at least seven"" children while treating childless women at a fertility clinic in Washington's Virginia suburbs which he operated from 1976 to 1988. More recently, the probable number of Jacobson-begotten children has been raised to ""as many as 75"".
Dr Jacobson does not deny having used his own semen in his fertility practice, but does deny that any fraud was involved. In an interview with the Washington Post, he admitted having been a donor ""on a few occasions""--an admission not corroborated by his lawyers. What they have said is that if he indeed used his own seed to impregnate his patients, the women should have been grateful since he did it with the knowledge that his sperm was ""clean"".
Yet, as Edward Wallach of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions points out, sperm can be pretty much guaranteed to be clean-free from AIDS, hepatitis B and other infectious diseases--by freezing it for a few months and then testing the donor again for possible infection before thawing and using the semen. Besides, women usually expect more from a donor than freedom from infection: his and his family's history of health and genetic disease are considered, too.
Ethical doctors do not use the same donor for more than ten successful pregnancies. Since children born to many women from a single biological father are actually half-brothers or half-sisters, the limit is set to reduce the possibility of the children of such unions unwittingly marrying each other.
Besides charging him with using his own sperm to impregnate unsuspecting patients, the grand jury alleges that Dr Jacobson lied to the Federal Trade Commission three years ago when it was investigating complaints that he injected some women with a hormone that made them test falsely positive for pregnancy. He subsequently told them they had miscarried when their ""pregnancies"" failed to progress.
The trade commission, to which Dr Wallach served as a consultant, obtained an injunction that led Mr Jacobson to close his clinic and set up a $250,000 fund to make some restitutions. After the Virginia Board of Medicine disciplined him, he moved to Utah, where he is engaged in genetic research. This is a field in which Dr Jacobson has unquestioned expertise: he was America's first doctor to perform amniocentesis, a now well-established procedure which makes it possible to detect genetic abnormalities early in pregnancy.
In this sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde atmosphere, the case of the United States v Jacobson heads for trial, probably in February. If convicted, the alleged super-sire could spend several years in prison."

Since Paul Tsongas declared his tilt at the presidency on April 30th, he has suffered the far worse fate of being largely ignored by the cynics and having the dogged phrases of his earnest message reported without comment. Poking any kind of fun at Mr Tsongas, who fought off cancer in 1984, was out of bounds. Besides, nobody expected him to win.
Yet Mr Tsongas is now, at last, fair sport at America's newspaper terminals. In a profile published on January 1st, the New York Times wrote that he ""does not stir. He is less the rousing Paul Revere that he would like voters to think him than the sombre St Paul his critics once dubbed him."" Such mockery proves Mr Tsongas has arrived--and for good reason. He is persistently outscoring his opponents in the opinion polls in New Hampshire, site of the first and most crucial primary on February 18th.
None of this surprises the phlegmatic Mr Tsongas. In every one of his political campaigns (culminating with a six-year stint in the Senate, until his illness), Mr Tsongas was the outsider ignored by party, press and heavy money. Yet he has never lost a campaign.
Throughout the lonely summer of 1991, when he was the only declared candidate, Mr Tsongas kept saying he would be taken more seriously once he had other contenders against whom he could be judged. Sure enough, the first New Hampshire opinion polls in the early autumn put him out in front, a lead that was quickly dismissed by the pundit class. The latest opinion poll, for the Concord Monitor, was taken immediately after Mario Cuomo pulled out of the race he never entered (Mr Cuomo was the only national heavyweight Mr Tsongas feared). Mr Tsongas led the field with 25% of the Democratic vote. Bill Clinton, the national front-runner, trailed with 17% and Bob Kerrey came third with 14%. Tom Harkin, Jerry Brown and Douglas Wilder had 8%, 6% and 1% respectively. Although that left 29% undecided, it hinted that Mr Tsongas's strength was built on more than name recognition.
Mr Tsongas is doing well partly because his low-key style works on television. In November, in the first televised debate among some of the contenders, Mr Tsongas ran rings around Mr Clinton and Mr Wilder. While those two scrapped in unseemly fashion, Mr Tsongas waved his 85-page pamphlet, ""A call to economic arms"", claiming that America's problems and their solutions lay in that small volume. He did well in a national televised debate in December between all six main candidates.
And he comes off still better in the curious ""retail"" politics of New Hampshire: in living rooms and coffee bars. It was in such intimate settings that Gary Hart shone and John Glenn disappointed, in 1984. From his Massachusetts base across the border, Mr Tsongas has trudged the length and breadth of New Hampshire, from Nashua in the south, a mill-town like Lowell, his own home town, to Lebanon in the north-west. It is a state that has been visibly devastated by the recession. Its constituents are ready for the message of economic renewal--no quick fix, mind-that Mr Tsongas preaches.
ROTARY CLUB PIN-UP
Mr Tsongas is adamant he is not for protectionism, which he says is ""a guarantor of your inability to compete."" But he is convinced that America's root problem is a lack of manufacturing competitiveness. He is unabashed about it: that competitiveness can be restored only with the help of an industrial policy. It is one that calls for cuts in the capital-gains tax, R&D tax credits and state investment in ""strategic"" industries. Local Rotarians drool over Mr Tsongas in New Hampshire.
On social issues, Mr Tsongas is an all-out liberal, which does not seem to harm him at the hustings. The primary elections, at least, are all about economics. Mr Tsongas, a member of several company boards, has had time to acquire the ""mindset"" of American business. That is all that businessmen are interested in.
Of all the candidates, Mr Tsongas and Mr Clinton have tried hardest to make this race one of issues rather than personalities--and Mr Clinton's flashiness is a greater liability than the grey candour of Mr Tsongas. Among the candidates, it is clear these two have the greatest mutual respect. Both have pegged out comprehensive programmes by which they wish to be judged (though both lack a decent proposal for healthcare reform).
Yet in some ways, Mr Tsongas is closer in spirit to the supposedly ""charismatic"" Mr Kerrey--and even to the self-styled ""outsider"", Mr Brown. All three hark back to an earlier, more uplifting, era. Mr Tsongas had a formative period in the early 1960s with the Peace Corps; Mr Kerrey had his Vietnam injuries and his fight for recovery; Mr Brown calls upon a fabled age of political innocence, before special-interest money.
Unlike the other two, however, Mr Tsongas sounds as though he knows why he is running. To prove the point, he is printing another 50,000 copies of his pamphlet to hand around New Hampshire. This will complement the television ads that have swimming-mad Mr Tsongas wearily butterfly almost into your living room. Mr Tsongas finds the unhurried time to talk to any willing listener in New Hampshire. He had the time on new year's eve, when other candidates were chasing party money, to drive his daughter to a party. Mr Tsongas has a calmness about his mission. If he wins New Hampshire, he will have deserved it."

Charles de Gaulle once dismissed a visiting Japanese prime minister as a transistor salesman--a gibe the Japanese have neither forgotten nor forgiven. Because of good manners, and self-interest, they will not call George Bush a mere car salesman when he arrives in Tokyo on January 7th, after stops in Australia, Singapore and South Korea, for three days of talks on security, trade and world affairs. But since he will be accompanied by the bosses of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, a car salesman is what the American president will pretend to be.
""Pretend"" because no one on either side of the Pacific seriously expects the Japanese to forsake their own well-made and affordable motor cars for dubious products from Detroit. But with America's presidential election just 11 months away, the Japanese understand Mr Bush's need to be seen as the booster of American exports and protector of American jobs. They also understand that Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, is destined to become the hapless fall guy--even though, after only two months in office, his popularity is already plummeting.
Deservedly so. Mr Miyazawa has mishandled every big policy initiative presented during the extraordinary session of the Diet (parliament) which started with his appointment and ended just before Christmas. First, the bills to allow Japanese soldiers to participate in United Nations peace-keeping and disaster operations had to be dropped. Then he failed to include a special tax in the new budget so Japan would not be caught dithering, in Gulf war fashion, in the next international crisis. Now he has had to abandon plans to revise Japan's money-grubbing electoral system. The electorate senses that the undoubtedly clever Mr Miyazawa is short of gumption.
His lack comes at a bad time. Like Mr Bush, Mr Miyazawa also faces a crucial test at the polls in 1992. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is desperate to regain the upper-house majority that it lost after the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal two years ago. Ever since, the government has been stymied when it has tried to push controversial legislation through the Diet. Mr Miyazawa knows that he must deliver that majority in July's election or his party bosses will boot him out.
His best ploy will be to play the international statesman. Using just such a ploy, his predecessor, Toshiki Kaifu, who bungled even more disastrously at home than Mr Miyazawa, became Japan's most popular prime minister since the war. The Japanese enjoy seeing their leaders on television hobnobbing with the great around the globe.
Mr Miyazawa's difficulty is that he has only two brief opportunities to capture public attention before the Diet becomes embroiled in the annual budget debate. One is Mr Bush's visit to Japan. The other is the compromise on agricultural protection that America, the European Community and Japan will have to achieve to save the GATT's Uruguay round from acrimonious failure. In both cases, Japan will see itself giving more than it gains--so Mr Miyazawa's place in the spotlight could end up being more dangerous than valuable.
What he wants from the Americans is a ""Tokyo Declaration""--a high-minded proclamation outlining the next 50 years of cooperation between the United States and Japan to help solve the world's problems. Mr Miyazawa will propose an international conference in Tokyo to consider the economic issues confronting the Middle East; and he will join Mr Bush in stressing the need to prevent the proliferation of both nuclear and conventional weapons. All this will be drafted with fine phrases about peace and mutual understanding. Innocuous documents that promise no risk or expense go down especially well in Japan.
In return, the Japanese will let Mr Bush have his ""Action Plan"". This will be explicitly concerned with bilateral trade issues--and will give the president a few economic souvenirs to take home.
One, gift-wrapped on the eve of Mr Bush's departure from Washington, was a cut in Japan's discount rate from 5% to 4.5%--the second half-point reduction in less than two months and one which, in unlikely theory, could expand Japan's demand for American goods. Another is the squeeze that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already put on Japan's car makers to limit their exports to America for at least another year. Japan's ""voluntary"" agreement to export no more than 2.3m cars a year to America was due to expire in March. The new deal will cost Japanese car companies nothing. They export only 1.8m cars a year to the United States now that their big American factories are up and running. A similar export restraint on Japanese machine-tool makers is to be extended a further two years.
MITI's other token is to get Japan's car dealers to sell American models alongside Japanese ones. The transport ministry has meanwhile agreed to relax some import requirements on American cars. Even the budget has been skewed to reap American praise after complaints that Japan has been diverting public investment into industry at the expense of ordinary Japanese people--who are then forced to put up with third-world standards of roads, airports, sanitation, housing and recreation facilities.
As a gesture to the Americans, money for the government's construction projects is to be increased by 5.3%, compared with an overall rise of 2.7% agreed on December 28th for the next fiscal year's Y72.2 trillion ($580 billion) budget. In addition, local governments are expected to spend 11% more on public works and there will be a 10.9% rise in the ""fiscal investment and loans programme"" to allow more money to find its way into public works.
All this, Mr Miyazawa can argue, is evidence that Japan is delivering on its promise to spend Y430 trillion over ten years modernising its infrastructure. True, none of Japan's promises is likely to put more than a handful of Americans back to work--but they will sound good when Mr Bush hits the campaign trail.
The question is what Mr Miyazawa will get in return. Will Mr Bush be as accommodating in the final haggling over the Uruguay round--and the necessity for Japan to open its sacred rice market to foreign growers? Probably not, in which case Mr Miyazawa's reward for playing the obliging host could be to see his support from the party and the public disappear altogether.
Balancing act
Trade could hardly fail to be at the top of George Bush's Asian agenda. America is Asia's biggest export market, buying around a third of the exports of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and China, and a quarter of Hong Kong's. Japan, China and Taiwan together accounted for four-fifths of America's trade deficit in 1991, up from half in 1988. In most cases, however, America's deficits with Asia are not widening; they are simply not shrinking as fast as America's deficit with the rest of the world.
Indeed, although Japan's total trade surplus in 1991 reached a record $100 billion or so, its surplus with America narrowed, to an annual rate of $46 billion in the first ten months of 1991, down from $56 billion in 1988. Taiwan also trimmed its surplus with America, while America's trade with South Korea and Hong Kong is now almost in balance.
One imbalance, however, continues to balloon. China's trade surplus with America went from $4 billion in 1988 to $10.4 billion in 1990, and on one estimate soared to above $13 billion in 1991."

On December 31st the North and South agreed in principle to ban nuclear weapons. This followed a pact earlier in the month that promised reconciliation and non-aggression by the two foes. The Korean war fought in 1950-53 at last seems formally to be ending.
The new agreement was signed at Panmunjom, a town that lies across the cold war's last frontier. It is expected to be endorsed by the prime ministers of the two countries this month and come into force in February. It says that neither country will ""test, manufacture, produce, accept, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons"". It bans nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment. Such facilities are thought to be under development in Yongbyon, in North Korea. A committee with representatives from North and South is to draw up a plan for mutual inspections.
South Korea had a stock of nuclear missiles, kept under American control. The missiles were reported to have been removed last autumn. The North does not have nuclear weapons, but is close to making them. Some of the North's plant at Yonbyon is believed to be hidden underground. The South wants to be sure the whole plant will be open to inspection.
Other countries, among them Japan and America, have been pressing the North to accept a thorough examination of the Yongbyon plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency wants the North to allow its inspectors into the country. The North is believed to be willing but has not said so publicly. The agency's board of governors is due to discuss the matter on February 15th.
The North hopes that its reward for acting in a reasonable way will be economic aid and foreign investment. It recently said it would establish free trade zones in Rajin and Sonbong. This belated experimentation comes after a miserable year for the North's government, with the failure of the coup against Mr Gorbachev and China's refusal to provide aid. Japan could be its salvation. If the Japanese like the way things are going they could resume talks on establishing diplomatic relations, with the possibility of $5 billion in aid to follow.
The South's president, Roh Tae Woo, wants to go down in history as the man who led the Koreas towards reunification. He said this week that 1992 would open ""an era during which we will construct a national community for all our 70m compatriots."" It is rumoured that a meeting between Mr Roh and the North's president, Kim Il Sun, will take place in March at Kaesong, in the North. Since Mr Kim, the North's leader since 1948, has never met a South Korean president, this will be the surest sign yet that the North is prepared to end its isolation."

Under laws that prohibit aid to the communists, the state-run shipbuilder is banned from any dealings, either direct or indirect, with the ideological foe across the Taiwan Strait.
But the truth is that such dealings are already commonplace for Taiwan's self-willed private sector. The Hualon Group, one of Taiwan's leading textiles manufacturers, has, it seems, been operating one of Shanghai's largest garment factories for at least a year after furtively investing there via an offshore holding company. It is one of at least 3,000 Taiwanese companies with operations stretching from the Fujian coast right across to Xinjiang in the far west, where President Enterprises, the largest Taiwanese food manufacturer, plans to grow tomatoes and make them into ketchup.
The profits from such operations helped produce a strong economic recovery in 1991: Taiwan's GNP grew at an estimated 7.21%, compared with a (by its own standards) disastrous 5.2% in 1990. This in turn helped the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to a landslide victory over the Democratic Progressive Party (which favours abandoning Taiwan's claim to the mainland) in the December 21st election for the National Assembly.
But what troubles the KMT is the price Taiwan may have to pay: a dependence on trade with the mainland that will make the island a hostage to the old men in Beijing. Despite a ban on direct dealings across the strait, indirect trade through Hong Kong has expanded at an average of almost 40% a year in the past four years, reaching well over $5 billion in 1991. Trade with China accounted for less than a quarter of 1% of Taiwan's trade pie in 1979. Now it is 4%--and growing.
The mainland's share of all Taiwan's exports in 1991 was around 6%. The Taiwan Institute for Economic Research, a government think-tank, sees it exceeding 10% in 1992. At that level, says the institute, China would be in a position to derail Taiwan's economy by applying sudden trade sanctions. Equally startling is the fact that Taiwan's $2.8 billion trade surplus with China in the first ten months of 1991 represented nearly a third of the entire global surplus chalked up by the island over that period.
Meanwhile, efforts to stop private industry becoming dependent on cheap mainland raw materials and semi-processed goods have been fruitless. ""Why buy coal from Indonesia or Australia"", asks the manager of a brickworks in central Taiwan,""when I can get it from China at a fraction of the price?"" The Board of Foreign Trade officially allows only 164 items, mostly foodstuffs and industrial raw materials, to be imported from China. Yet it laments in its latest release of trade figures that, of the top 20 items coming from the mainland, 15 are not on the approved list and so are competing directly with Taiwan's own products.
Another worry is that Taiwan's dependence on the mainland will drag it into disputes that are not of its making. Enraged by its trade deficit with China and by China's violations of intellectual-property rights, America is threatening sanctions against China's exports. Such retaliation would hurt the Taiwan-owned factories on the mainland, which is why the threat has prompted the authorities in Taipei to allow the import of semi-finished goods from the mainland--which can be completed in Taiwan and exported to America with the label ""Made in Taiwan"".
Such pragmatism, of course, only binds the island more closely to the mainland and increases the calls for the ban on direct trade and investment to be dropped. The government says it will introduce a monitoring system this month, to raise the alarm when any sector becomes overly reliant on China. This may be too late and beside the point. Government-supported academics from Taiwan are to meet counterparts from Hong Kong and China to debate the feasibility of forming a ""Great Chinese Economic zone"" out of the three economies."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224166179/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/18?accountid=14657,"The average shelf-life of Thai constitutions is less than four years. On December 9th Kin Bhumibol Adulyadej signed his country's 15th constitution since 1932. One of its provisions is that an election must be held within 120 days. The elected government will replace one that was appointed to run the country after a military coup last February. However, the new constitution ensures that this transfer of power will be nominal. The junta that led the coup has reserved the right to appoint 270 senators, who will have wide powers to curb the elected government.
The positive side of this arrangement is that, by recognising the Thai generals' conviction that they own the country, further coups become unnecessary. Like soldiers in many countries, Thailand's believe they have a monopoly of national honour.
Unlike most other soldiers, however, Thailand's also believe they should own more tangible assets. The army controls the domestic telephone monopoly and two of Thailand's four television stations. The air force runs the national airline and the airports. The navy has to make do with the port authority and the right to oversee a huge project to develop the seaboard to the east of Bangkok. Beyond these arrangements, it is normal for senior serving officers to have extensive business interests. Golf courses and logging concessions in neighbouring countries are popular lines.
To the increasingly large urban middle class, however, this military meddling now seems out of date for an economy that has been speeding along for the past five years. They reckon that too many generals and their coups are a national embarrassment, and bad for business.
The generals have been able to keep their grip on power only because the elected politicians were even worse for business. The government led by Chatichai Choonhavan, which was overthrown in February, had become a byword for corruption. Its ministers' tactic of squeezing bribes out of rival bidders for Bankok's infrastructure projects has ensured that none of those projects is yet under way. As a result, the capital is almost at a standstill.
Not that Mr Chatichai's government ever gave a hoot about the growing chaos in Bankok: its supporters were villagers whose votes could always be bought. The army, on the other hand, has been careful to listen to the capital's powerful middle class. Selected bureaucrats and businessmen, for example, are invited to attend part-time courses at the national defence college.
The most likely threat to the armed forces' political dominance therefore comes from within their own ranks. There are two clear fault lines. The first is between Suchinda Kraprayoon, who is both commander-in-chief of the army and the armed forces' supreme commander, and Kaset Rojananin, the commander of the air force.
General Suchinda, who organised the February coup, is expected to select a caretaker prime minister after the election. He will then, it is said, resign as supreme commander and hand command of the army to his brother-in-law, General Issarapong Noonpackdee, in September. That will leave him free to become prime minister. The air chief marshal harbours the same ambition, but lacks General Suchinda's brains and subtlety. He has the added disadvantage that his brother-in-law is not arranging the election (General Issarapong is the present interior minister).
The other fault line lies between two generations of officers. General Suchinda is a member of the fifth class to graduate from the Chulachomklao military academy. His classmates now hold all the main positions in the armed forces. Their monopoly on power has not pleased the other classes. The not-so-Young Turks in class eight are said to be particularly restive. Their dissatisfaction is being fuelled by General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, a former supreme commander who will serve as a rallying-point for opponents of the junta at the election.
Earlier in 1991 General Chavalit spoke out: ""The danger lies with [serving generals] starting to believe they can run the country and that politicians cannot...[General Suchinda] does not bother to consider my warning. Instead, he curses me, saying I've become a politician."""

Urged on by pressure groups, the government in Ottawa is conceding territorial claims from the peoples who occupied the land for many centuries before migrants began to arrive from Europe. In the interest of 500,000 descendants of the original Canadians, the nation's map is about to be redrawn. For a start, about one-fifth of its land area is getting a new name.
In March, or soon afterwards, the government of the Northwest Territories is to hold a plebiscite on dividing itself up. Its eastern half is to be renamed Nunavut, or ""land of the people"" in the language of the 17,500 Inuit whose ancestors have been there at least 4,000 years (and who used to be referred to as Eskimos). The political body that speaks for them, the Tungavik Federation of Nunavut, has reached agreement with the federal government on its area. By 1997 Nunavut will probably become a full-fledged territory, with its own elected government.
The future territory covers almost 2m square kilometres (some 770,000 square miles)--roughly, the size of the European Community less the British Isles. Most of it will remain Crown land, subject to federal control. The Inuit will acquire title to 350,000 square kilometres (more than 135,000 square miles)--roughly, the size of Greece. If the voters approve, this will be the largest peaceful land settlement in Canada's, or possibly anybody's, history. It has been a long time coming.
In 1973 Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government in Ottawa declared that it would negotiate land claims with organisations representing native peoples. Two categories of claims at once emerged. The more complex ones arose in the Yukon, most of British Columbia, Labrador and much of Quebec and the Northwest Territories. There, little or nothing had been done to implement old treaties between the government and the native peoples, most of them negotiated in the reign of Queen Victoria. Under those treaties, native peoples made comprehensive claims to land and resources.
Apart from the vast Nunavut deal, three such claims have been finally settled. Two are in northern Quebec. The other has been struck in the extreme north-western Arctic with the Inuvialuit people, one of whose main negotiators was Nellie Cournoyea, the daughter of a Norwegian trapper and an Inuit mother, who now Leads the government of the Northwest Territories. Five other land claims have reached advanced stages of negotiations. The federal government says it cannot deal with more than six big claims at a time; another 19--all in British Columbia--are listed for negotiation later.
More than 600 simpler, but no less contentious, claims have been made by Indian peoples, most of whom allege that the federal government in Ottawa has failed to observe existing treaties, usually by handing over Indian land to mining or timber companies without lawful surrender or compensation. About half these claims have been resolved. The government has a fistful of reasons for its delays with the rest.
Claims often overlap--inevitably, since Canada's indigenous peoples rarely stayed long in one place. (For example, Ojibwa people claim places where militant Mohawks asserted their alleged rights against the Quebec police, and the army, in 1990.) Further, some local groups are prepared to settle for part of their claim, whereas the nation-wide Assembly of First Nations, wary of bad precedents, tends to insist on all or nothing. The AFN is also firmly against one of the Ottawa government's conditions for agreement, that all further claims in the area be extinguished. These considerations have held up a final agreement with the Dene and Metis (mixed-race) peoples of the Mackenzie Valley, and could delay the Nunavut settlement.
The federal government insists, for obvious reasons, that all settlements must involve the provincial governments which own natural resources and provide residents with social services. The AFN dislikes triangular bargaining, arguing that the federal government must act as trustee for the aboriginal peoples--a principle laid down in a royal proclamation of 1783, confirmed by the Canadian constitution of 1982, and since reaffirmed by the courts. In the Sparrow case in 1984, involving a member of a Musqueam band caught fishing with a longer drift net than British Columbian regulations allowed, the Supreme Court held that the aboriginal right to fish for food could not be extinguished, even by conservationist regulations.
British Columbia is the hardest case. Indians remember that, for a century, successive provincial governments refused to recognise aboriginal rights. Recent Social Credit administrations ignored claims laid to most of the province by more than 20 native groups. But in October 1991 the New Democratic Party won an election, then recognised the legitimacy of aboriginal title to land and agreed to co-ordinate negotiations through a commission of two native and two government representatives, with an agreed chairman.
Much must be done to redress past injustices and remove the disadvantages which, to Canada's shame, its Indian peoples still suffer. Their birth rate is double the national average, and many of Canada's 500 Indian bands have outgrown the tiny reserves allocated to them. The AFN's new Grand Chief has set out to unite these scattered peoples, and thus give them political clout. He is Chief Ovide Mercredi, a quiet-spoken but determined lawyer with the advantage of being Cree, a people who range from northern Quebec to southern Alberta.
Fundamental questions remain unresolved. The federal government's latest constitutional proposals purport to offer the native people the self-government which they claim as an inherent right. Yet Canada's seemingly endless constitutional debate does have its virtues. Old treaties, long ignored, are nevertheless recognised as binding. Aboriginal rights can no longer be forgotten as they have been in the past, and were under the Meech Lake accord that failed to be ratified in 1990. The Indians and the Inuit, after the French-speakers of Quebec, have asserted their special place in Canada. The next set of constitutional proposals, due in 1992, must acknowledge that, if indeed Canada is to be held together."

The National Liberation Front (FLN) had outlived its welcome. The only opposition it could not suppress was that centred in the mosques. So the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was the dear winner in the first round of elections, on December 26th.
The Islamic Front won 188 seats outright, the Socialist Forces Front 25, the FLN just 15. The Islamic party needs to win just 28 more seats in the second round, on January 16th, to secure a majority in parliament. In that run-off its candidates will face a single opponent; if the FLN can get together with the other sizeable parties, the FIS may not look such an imposing victor after all.
The Algerian result worries that country's neighbours, especially Morocco. King Hassan claps fundamentalists in jail when he thinks they are getting powerful. But he has skilfully used his family's long-standing claim to be Defender of the Faith; Moroccan masques, and preachers, are well financed if they support him, and Muslims can hardly accuse him of impiety.
King Hassan's real round for concern about Algeria is not its Islamicness but its democracy. The king presents himself as a constitutional monarch. When the neighbours start voting, it makes him look feudal again. The king's apologists point out, truly enough, that he has permitted rival parties for years. Four loyalist groups form the ruling coalition, while several opposition parties (among them the Arab world's only legal communists) and trade unions share a quarter of the 360 seats in parliament, and run cities, including Fez and Marrakesh.
Yet the constitution gives the king absolute power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, preside over the cabinet, dissolve parliament and, in practice, take every big decision. Elected opposition members may attack the government's economic record--ministers may take the blame for inflation and unemployment--but not foreign policy, the king's preserve. Elections are rigged, unauthorised groups suppressed, and Moroccans who step out of line have for 30 years been falling victim to what Amnesty International has described as ""a pattern of political imprisonment, disappearances, and torture.""
Until recently, opposition politicians mostly played the king's game, in exchange for privileges. They had more freedom than most Arabs, and cited the need for ""national unity"" after Morocco's annexation of the Western Sahara in 1976 sparked off a bitter little war with the Polisario Front.
The political truce has begun to collapse. In November the two biggest opposition parties, the traditionalist Istiqlal and the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, jointly demanded ""genuine democracy"", with real power for parliament, transparent elections, and an amnesty for political detainees and exiles. Without mentioning the kin, the parties' demands struck at the heart of his system. The opposition has channeled popular discontent over jobs and prices into marches and strikes, calling for ""the people to be sovereign and a king who reins but does not rule"".
The secular opposition is gathering support. Moroccans discontented with poverty, unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor lean towards the illegal groups, especially Islamic ones. The emerging middle class wants political power; professionals, small businessmen and skilled workers, often familiar with Europe, oppose not only the king's political muscle but also the economic grip of those around him. France is pressing for reform. The United States, which has long valued Kin Hassan as a staunch anti-communist and a moderating influence in Arab-Israeli affairs, is drawing away from the king, as from its other authoritarian friends.
Concessions are on the way. The minimum wage has been increased. The 1992 budget promises higher spending (whether or not the government can afford it) on education, health and housing. A special programme has been launched to find work for 100,000 unemployed and restive graduates. Some, but not all, political prisoners have been released.
Yet there is no sign that the king plans to give up his autocratic powers. He may not yet feel the need. In three decades on the throne he has seen off at least two coup attempts and much unrest. Good luck and a healthier economy may pull him through again. And he has dodged one danger, by contriving the postponement of a United Nations referendum on the Western Sahara (see previous story). Whoever might have won, a lot of Saharans would have voted for independence, and others might have voted simply to show disapproval of their ruler. If people might vote against the king, he prefers no voting."

Robinson's government. Mr Robinson, who seemed an urbane and likeable figure to outsiders, was hated by many in his own country. His party kept only two seats, on his own island of Tobago. It was his 65th birthday. After five tiring years it must have seemed that there was no justice in the world.
Mr Robinson's National Alliance for Reconstruction won only 24% of the vote, against 45% for the People's National Movement under Patrick Manning, the new prime minister. The NAR had been plagued by troubles from the moment it was elected, with a 33 to 3 majority, in 1986, inheriting an economy squeezed by falling oil prices. Devaluation, public-sector pay cuts, new taxes and rising unemployment won Mr Robinson few friends. His Indo-Trinidadian deputy, Basdeo Panday, led a faction out of the government and formed a new party.
In July 1490, the country was shaken by mass looting during an attempted coup by a group of mainly Afro-Trinidadian Muslim converts, who held the prime minister hostage and shot him in the leg. He emerged shaken, but attracted surprisingly little public sympathy. Perhaps unfairly, his style of government was seen as arrogant, uncaring and out of touch.
Mr Manning, the new prime minister, is a 45-year-old geologist who ran the energy and mining ministry when his PNM was last in power. He became leader when the party, reduced to three parliamentary seats, had been in office for 30 years, and looked it. There were endless tales of mismanagement, corruption and drug-dealing by a patronage network that left the country's Indian population, and the island of Tobago, feeling unwanted.
Mr Manning has made good use of his five years as leader. The party's old guard has disappeared; most of them lost their seats in 1986 and were not reselected. The manifesto is full of new ideas, many of them sensible and not too expensive. There is more emphasis on private business than before, and no new big state projects.
The outgoing government's austerity policies made it unpopular, but produced at best a state of un-robust good health. Inflation, at 2%, is lower than it has been for 20 years. After a decade of decline, economic growth has started. With trade liberalised, exports of manufactures look healthy--but imports rose by 43% in the first half of 1991, and foreign-exchange reserves are falling. It is hard to squeeze more out of Trinidad's small oilfields, especially with prices falling.
A new budget must be ready by the end of January. There are commitments to remove value-added tax from school books, medicines and basic foods; and to honour a 2% public-sector pay award which the courts say should have been paid years ago. A lot of foreign debt falls due next year. Keeping the deficit under control will not be at all easy.
Trinidadians tend to worry about national unity, all the more so since few East Indians--they form almost half the population--voted for the new government. Mr Panday's United National Congress, almost exclusively Indian, won 29% of the vote, piling up huge majorities in the rural seats in central and southern Trinidad where most Indians live. But Mr Panday has heart trouble, and only a dozen parliamentary supporters. The UNC looks nothing like an alternative government.
The island of Tobago, with its new long-haul airport and its tourist boom, remains the last stronghold of Mr Robinson's party. Some Tobagonians do mutter about separatism, but not very seriously. Trinidadian governments have in the past punished constituencies for voting against them, by withholding contracts and favours. Mr Manning seems unlikely to make this mistake. He has carefully included Indian (and Chinese) Trinidadians in his cabinet, and kept the Tobago portfolio for himself.
In this, the prime minister seems more enlightened than many of his party's supporters. The PNM is widely regarded as the black people's party; it notched up more seats than its voting strength justified partly because the multiracial business class, most of which supports Mr Robinson and the NAR, is spread across many constituencies, and Trinidad votes by the British first-past-the-post system. But business people seem ready to work with the new government. Trinidad's democracy has deep roots."

The economy grew by 2.3% in 1990, and may row by 3% this year. The country is mostly peaceful, and its main left-win revolutionary band gave up trying to take over the government in 1991 after a decade of fighting. Nevertheless, Ecuadorans want nothing to do with President Rodrigo Borja's social-democratic government. A presidential election is due in May; campaigning began in December. Two conservative politicians lead the polls, while Mr Borja's Democratic Left Party scores barely 10%.
Mr Borja's government does not have a cause. He was thrust into office by assailing the pro-American government of Leon Febres Cordero that preceded him. Since then, his programme has been to hail the status quo. While the rest of Latin America enacts lightning free-market reforms, he pledges stability and stagnation.
Ecuadorans want change. Inflation is stuck at 50 a year. Restrictive labour codes make it nearly impossible for employers to fire organised workers. So companies hire part-timers and make sure that their full-timers cannot form unions. One result is that 60% of the population is either unemployed or underemployed.
Ecuadorans worry about the future. The country, a member of OPEC, gets more than half of its export revenues from petroleum products. But few large new wells are being drilled, and Ecuador is expected to stop exporting oil within 10 years, partly because ridiculously low domestic prices are causing consumption to soar. Despite small recent price increases, a gallon of petrol costs about 50 American cents, and shiploads of the stuff are smuggled to neighbouring Colombia and Peru to be sold at higher prices.
Two conservatives promise something new. So far, that is helping them in the polls. The acknowledged early front-runner is Sixto Duran Ballen, who is 71; unusually, his support comes both from the central highlands and from the steamy, teeming coast. Mr Duran, known for his stolid maturity, has twice before been a presidential candidate; both times he did well at the start of the campaign and faded in the stretch. Jaime Nebot, a centre-right populist whose brash and sometimes violent approach goes down well on the coast, hopes Mr Duran will fade again this year.
The dark horse is running third, so far. Abdala Bucaram is expected to pick up support from Messrs Duran and Nebot on the coast. Mr Bucaram was nearly elected president instead of Mr Borja in 1988, but in the end voters rejected his reckless rhetoric. Since then he has suffered bad times. He went into exile in 1990 after being charged with corruption as mayor of the coastal city of Guayaquil. His cousin and sometimes political ally, Averroes Bucaram, was in 1990 physically ousted from his position as president of Congress by security forces, after a brawl on the chamber floor.
The ruling Democratic Left Party is expected to improve on the 10% of the vote that the initial polls give it; but none of the pundits expects the party to win. Ecuadorans talk as if Mr Borja had accomplished nothing. That is not quite true. He has made modest cuts in the bureaucracy, and cut the public sector deficit. His administration has lowered some tariffs, ended some subsidies and reformed the labour code in ways that might create new jobs. After initial reluctance, the government has agreed to join its Andean neighbours in a free-trade pact.
Ecuador is still free of much of the explosive strife, involving drugs and gangsters of right and left, that afflicts Peru and Colombia. Mr Borja helped make the country even more peaceful in 1991, by convincing its biggest guerrilla group-called Alfaro Lives, Dammit!--to give up its arms in February and join the political process.
But that victory, like the president's other achievements, was flawed. In September, a dissident guerrilla faction occupied parts of the British Embassy in Quito for two days, in protest against their leader's detention. A week after that was sorted out, another left-win an set off bombs at the offices of the Democratic Left and the state oil company. The fight may continue even after Mr Borja is gone."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224163445/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/23?accountid=14657,"Words of warning are writ large on a billboard over Bulawayo's main shopping street: ""Only 18 weeks of water left."" Shops sport decorations urging citizens to use less water. Zimbabwe's second city, with nearly 1m people, is threatened with drying up.
Local rainfall has been ""normal"" in only two of the past 13 years, and there has been a drought in four; in the other years the rains have been at best patchy. Bulawayo's reservoirs are drying out, barely replenished by the feeble rains of the present season. Usable reserves had at the end of 1991 dwindled to 27m cubic metres. Given the city's normal needs, that meant it had only 18 weeks of water remaining. Rationing limits industry to 80% of its requirements, and households to 600 litres a day. The city council is tightening those restrictions, and planning for standpipes once the house-to-house pipes must be cut off.
The radical solution, now gathering appeal, is to pipe water to the city from the Zambezi river, 400 kilometres (250 miles) away to the north. A coalition of Bulawayo businessmen and politicians has commissioned a study from a South African engineering firm, which seems to show that abstracting the equivalent of just 90 seconds of the immense river's daily flow could provide all the water the city needs, and irrigate farms in the parched Matabeleland countryside. A clergyman preaches that conservation and prayer are the only ways to combat the water crisis--together with donations to the Zambezi Water Project.
For once, the people, black and white, are united. In four months the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project has raised Z$5.5m ($1.1m) in donations, with schoolchildren and pensioners chipping in alongside large companies. Although it is an impressive sum, the whole pipeline would cost some Z$900m. Spotting lucrative contracts, no fewer than seven foreign missions (Japanese and Canadians to the fore) have approached the project committee. But a big contract would imply government-to-government loans and guarantees. For that, President Robert Mugabe's government in the capital, Harare, must endorse the project as its own.
Bulawayo's industries provide the chief successes of the government's economic reforms, which are intended to promote manufactured exports; of the city's textile manufactures, Z$250m-worth go for export, against domestic sales worth Z$650m. On the face of it, the government would gain by providing Bulawayo with enough water. Local people have been pleading with the government in Harare for five years, to no avail.
Harare politicians are used to letting everything happen by the timetable of Mr Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party. Matabeleland, of which Bulawayo is the capital, is the stronghold of the Ndebele people--2m of Zimbabwe's 10m population, who backed (sometimes with violence) the opposition to Mr Mugabe, until their veteran leader, Joshua Nkomo, merged his mainly Ndebele party with ZANU in 1987. Memories linger of the Matabeleland insurgency of 1982-87, in which government forces were brutal, and 10,000 people died or disappeared. In those years the government did little to develop Matabeleland, and it has done precious little since. To be fair, other Zimbabwean cities like Mutare and Masvingo also face serious water shortages, but none appears as drastic as Bulawayo's.
Bulawayo's boosters are now confident they can get the pipeline project into the new national five-year plan, due to be published in February. The local lobby, through its Zambezi Water Project, hopes to force the government's hand by paying Z$15m for engineers' blueprints, and lining up an international financial package so that construction of the pipeline can start as soon as possible.
Optimists reckon that ground could be broken in 1992, and water flowing by mid-1993. Conservationists, anxious that one pipeline from the Zambezi could be followed by others, are not so happy. Nor, no doubt, is the government, desperate to cut its spending without upsetting its own supporters, few of whom live in Bulawayo."

The new structure is neither very common (its members argue all the time) nor very wealthy. Yet, at least for the moment, the Commonwealth is very useful.
It has already done two valuable jobs. One was to provide the means of a quick, dignified death for the Soviet Union. The Commonwealth idea was launched by the three Slav republics--Russia, Ukraine and Belorussia--in the Belorussian capital, Minsk, on December 8th. Two weeks later in Kazakhstan's capital, Alma Ata, 11 republics signed up as ""equal co-founders"" (the odd-man-out, Georgia, may join once it has settled its own bloody power struggle).
On December 25th President Mikhail Gorbachev performed one last pioneering act: he became the first leader in Soviet history to resign. It was a suitably graceful exit, but by then he barely had a job to resign from. The next day the Soviet parliament formally voted the country out of existence.
The Commonwealth's other use has been to offer a forum for resolving, or at least discussing, the problems bequeathed by the Soviet Union to its successor states. A couple of the most pressing issues have already been settled, on paper anyway. A protocol to the Alma Ata agreement recognises the current borders of all the Commonwealth's members. And at the latest summit, in Minsk on December 30th, the leaders confirmed that the ex-Soviet strategic nuclear forces (including both the weapons themselves and all support services) would remain under a single command.
Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, will have his finger on the nuclear button. But any use of the weapons would need the agreement of the three other nuclear states--Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belorussia--and require consultation with all the Commonwealth's members. All Belonrussia's nuclear weapons are to be removed or destroyed by mid-1992, Ukraine's by the end of 1994.
About much else, the 11 members have disagreed, often angrily. Even then, the Commonwealth gives an outlet for argument. Of the many areas of dispute (should there be a Commonwealth citizenship?; should there be a common force of border guards?; which, if any, responsibilities of the former Soviet state should the Commonwealth take over?), three stand out.
* THE ARMED FORCES. At Minsk this week, the 11 leaders failed to agree to keep a joint conventional military force. Most say they will stick together for now, though under precisely what command structure is unclear (so much so that Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov reportedly threatened to resign before agreeing to remain interim commander of the Commonwealth force). But they accepted that countries which want to can form their own armies. Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldavia intend to do so. Russia has plans to have its own national guard. Tricky detailed decisions on how to split up the 4m-strong ex-Soviet force lie ahead. For example, Ukraine has laid claim to the full Black Sea fleet. Russia is prepared to cede part of it, but not all.
* THE ECONOMY. The extent of economic cooperation has been the subject of some of the fiercest rows. Ukraine, in particular, objected to Russia forcing the pace of price liberalisation. The Ukrainians wanted Russia to agree to a small delay until they were ready. They complained that Russia, which controls the money-printing presses, was not supplying Ukraine with enough roubles to cope with soaring prices and wages (""We could find ourselves in the rouble zone without any roubles,"" said Ukraine's president, Leonid Kravchuk, after the latest meeting in Minsk). Commonwealth members are supposed to keep a single currency. But Ukraine is already issuing coupons for use in that country only, as a prelude to introducing its own money.
* RUSSIA'S POWER. In theory, all 11 Commonwealth members are equals. Yet Russia has well over half the group's total population. Mr Yeltsin has gone out of his way to avoid appearing to throw his weight about (which is why the Commonwealth has its headquarters in Minsk, not Moscow). But the others are wary. They agreed to Russia taking over the permanent Soviet seat on the United Nations Security Council, but object to Russia's bid to become the legal successor of the Soviet state.
It is because of the tension between Russian power and the others' concern to limit it that the 11 have been able to agree on only the outlines of an organisation (twice-yearly summits of heads of state and of heads of government; several ministerial committees; but as yet no detailed rules on decision-taking). Russia is unlikely to let itself be overly restrained for long. Ukraine, suspicious of Russia, is determined to keep the Commonwealth as loose as possible.
All that, plus the mistrust of central power after seven decades of communism, mean that the Commonwealth may develop into little more than a debating club. Indeed, it would be no surprise if, rather like Mr Gorbachev, it were one day to retire quietly from the scene, its job usefully done."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224172060/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/25?accountid=14657,"Big bang happened in Russia on January 2nd, when most prices were set free. On the same day, the Russian government launched its great sell-off of state businesses. If all goes according to plan (which of course it won't), by the end of 1992 some 60% of retail shops and of the food industry and 70% of the construction and light industries should have been privatised. Before long, a large private sector should have risen from the ruins of state planning.
Some say that that this is already happening. Look at the bustle of private traders on Moscow's showpiece street, the Arbat, or at its weekend flea-market at Izmailovo. Sample the un-Soviet quality of food and service at one of the new private restaurants, not to mention at the giant downtown McDonald's. Note the swagger of the art-dealing, commodity-trading, share-owning new rich.
Even measured by official statistics, the private sector in the former Soviet Union is already surprisingly large: 15% of GNP (and that excludes the rampant black market), up from virtually nothing in the early 1980s. Sergei Yegorov, the president of the Association of Russian Banks, says that 20m people are employed in the non-agricultural private sector in the former union.
But in Russia the use of the term ""private sector"" is misleading. It is usually extended to whatever is not 100% owned by central or local government. It therefore embraces many businesses that in the West would be classified as state-owned.
Take KamAz, the world's largest truck-producing plant, with an output equal to the whole of America's truck industry. It counts as a partly ""private sector"" enterprise because over 40% of its shares are held by organizations other than central or republican governments. But most of these organizations are themselves 100% owned by the state.
Look closely, moreover, and you find that the official private sector is concentrated in only five areas: cooperatives, wholesale trading, joint ventures, banking and farming. The first three of these present a distorted version of capitalism. The banks are illiquid. Only the farmers offer much evidence of real entrepreneurship.
Both the concentration of private business and its distortions stem from the strange conditions under which it developed. For years, private business was illegal. Such business as there was existed on criminalised black markets.
The suspicion that Russian entrepreneurs are all crooks still lingers--and not only in public opinion. Of the half-dozen best-known Russian businessmen, one was put in jail, one claimed to have been hounded by the KGB and one fled the country in 1991.
The man who fled was Artem Tarasov, the first Soviet citizen to proclaim himself a millionaire. He claimed that a policeman investigating charges of corruption against him had put out a 12,000-rouble contract on his life (now a mere $120 at the free-market rate). The man who says the KGB has tried to ensnare him is Konstantin Borovoi, the president of the Russian Commodity Exchange. And the man out on bail is Edward Tenkyakov, president of the Moscow central stock exchange, who was arrested during August's coup for allegedly accepting a 150,000-rouble bribe (he is said to have remarked that only an apparatchik would have thought that a lot money; he himself could earn it in ten minutes). The founder of the Russian millionaires' club, a 25-year-old whizz-kid, German Sterligov, has sent his family to live in a safer place: Manhattan.
This is not to say that these men are criminals. But the association of private business with crime is inevitable, and not just because of 70 years of communist propaganda. The central-planning system has broken down with neither the legal infrastructure nor the competition of a market economy yet in place. There have been legal loopholes and shortages galore for canny entrepreneurs to ""exploit"".
Many roads from communism
The revival of private business began with co-operatives. In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev relaxed laws on ownership to allow groups of people to own a business ""co-operatively"" (which still sounded acceptably socialist). Co-operatives mushroomed. In 1987, their turnover was about 330m roubles. In 1988, it was 6 billion roubles. By 1990, there were more than 200,000 co-operatives employing 5m people, with a turnover of over 40 billion roubles. Westerners in big cities, who flocked to co-operative restaurants to eat a decent meal, often hailed this as a new kind of economic activity.
Mostly, it wasn't. Restaurants were only a tiny bit of the picture. Over 80% of co-operatives were ""affiliated with"" (ie, controlled by) state enterprises. A state enterprise would turn some of its production facilities into co-operatives, making the same goods with the same workforce and distributing them through the same state channels. Prices, however, were higher and less of the profit had to be handed over to the government.
This was not so much a new form of business activity as a way of increasing the earnings of the old. That was needed because enterprises were subject to price controls while the government was encouraging them to increase wages. Co-operatives were a kind of safety valve. But as government control over enterprises began to break down, the safety valve was no longer needed. In 1991, the number of co-operatives fell back to around 150,000.
Many joint ventures were, like co-operatives, created by state organisations not as new activity, but as a ruse to increase their revenues--this time by charging dollars. Ministries and state firms would set up ""independent companies"", conclude a joint venture with a foreign partner and charge dollars for goods or services that used to be available in roubles. This has helped joint ventures survive and multiply. But evidence from Communist Party files since the coup suggests that a lot of the cash accruing to the Soviet partners was stashed away by apparatchiks in foreign bank accounts, ""for their retirement"". Joint ventures used by one side to provide boltholes is not a way to build a market economy.
The third step in the development of private business was the rise of commodity exchanges. These started to appear in the summer of 1990. The largest of them, the Russian Commodity Exchange, is only a year old. In 1991, according to Konstantin Zatulin, one of the most prominent of Russia's new entrepreneurs (with a background in the Komsomol, the Communist youth organisation), 5,000-6,000 brokerage firms sprang up to work in some 400 stock markets, most of them in Russia.
The commodity markets are bazaars. Everything from sneakers to computers to heavy-duty trucks is available through them. Their business has boomed. In December 1990, the Russian Commodity Exchange traded 200,000 roubles-worth of goods. In December 1991, its turnover was some 4 billion. The first half-billion roubles of business by its main rival, the Moscow Commodity Exchange, took three months. The next billion took one month. Now it trades nearly 1 billion roubles a week.
The commodity exchanges have many virtues. They provide direct competition with the state supply system that once monopolised distribution. As they expand, they are beginning to resemble western exchanges, specialising in particular contracts and including securities transactions. And they have provided Russia with its first experience in how to manage and organise trading contracts.
But the exchanges' success is artificial. In a shortage-ridden economy, these marginal free markets have commanded huge markups. Most of the members of the Russian millionaires' club are commodity brokers. Moreover, with prices on the commodity exchanges often ten times as high as those fixed by the state, there have been strong incentives for producers to withhold goods from the state distribution system in order to sell them on the commodity markets. Now that prices are being freed, the easy profits of the commodity markets should end.
Fresh financiers, productive peasants
On the face of it, banks have been even more successful than commodity markets. In 1987, the banking system was just the financial counterpart to the central-planning system. Enterprises did not borrow money from banks for investment; they were allocated it out of the government budget. Personal transactions were made largely in cash, so personal and business transactions were separate. Now, virtually the whole banking sector is ""commercial""--that is, it is must raise cash for onward lending by attracting deposits and by earning profits on its loan portfolio. In 1987, there were only six banks (in addition to the central bank). Now, there are about 1,500.
But the number of new commercial banks is no guide to their health. Half of them have been established by enterprises in the same business (or by regional branches of a state bank that used to specialise in that business) in order to lend money to themselves. So the banks' loan portfolios are heavily concentrated and vulnerable to changes in their founders' business.
Bank Vozrozhdenie (Renaissance Bank), for example, was founded using assets of Agroprombank, a state bank set up in 1987 to lend to the farm industry. Its biggest shareholder is a collective farm outside Moscow. And 40% of its loans have gone to agriculture. If the collective farm begins to lose money, it will be able to put strong pressure on the bank to bail it out through soft loans. If the bank gives way, and is itself threatened, the central bank would then face the choice of either bailing it out or of forcing the collective farm, the bank, and possibly other customers into bankruptcy.
Agriculture, however, is one area where private business is growing despite, rather than because of, the problems of the public sector. It provides the best evidence that entrepreneurs can break free of central planning to the benefit the whole economy.
According to official statistics, there are 38m private farmers in the ex-Soviet Union. This figure includes the private plots of collective-and state-farm workers, but even so it is a huge number: over a third of the agricultural labour force and a sharp increase after two decades of decline. Gennady Semigin, the head of a private-sector pressure group, reckons there are 30,000 ""real"" private farms--by which he means farms which provide the families that work them with their main or only source of income.
These are easily the most productive part of farming in the old Soviet Union. They grow more than a 25% of total farm output on only 3% of the farmland. Yields on private farms are nearly ten times as high as they are on state and collective farms.
More privatisation should greatly boost Russian agriculture. But it would be a mistake to think that this alone would increase yields tenfold. Private farmers are unusually productive partly because they concentrate on high-value farming, like vegetables and livestock. Private farming accounts for 33% of the cattle, 35% of all poultry and 60% of all potatoes in the ex-Soviet Union.
Farmers can grow potatoes and raise cattle using plain hard work. But on Russia's endless steppes, machinery is required--and Russia's farm-equipment makers have been unable to produce anything except tractors the size of tanks. Until they start producing the right kind of machinery for private farmers or until the farmers are able to import what they need, Russian agriculture is likely to continue as a mix of private gardeners and public prairie-farms.
None of this shows that capitalism cannot function in Russia. Far from it. Enterprise managers in state industry have proved themselves admirably adaptable--able to improvise new ways of doing business to increase their revenues in the face of government controls. But it does show that, without a proper legal infrastructure and a functioning price system, the private sector becomes distorted. Proper laws and prices are needed--and those are what Boris Yeltsin is now striving to provide."

But the peacekeepers will not come until the fighting has stopped. For now, the war rages on.
So far it has not touched the central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia & Hercegovina, which remains at peace--but only just. Pessimists predict that the pressure for the place to proclaim itself an independent country in the next couple of weeks will be the spark that ignites its ethnic powder keg. Maybe. But the first lesson of Balkanology is to mistrust most predictions.
Unlike the five other Yugoslav republics, Bosnia has no predominant nationality. Its 4.4m people are divided between those describing themselves as Muslims (40%), Serbs (33%) and Croats (19%). Despite this unlikely mix, Bosnia is an old entity which has survived the cataclysms of local history. In 1875 trouble in this Ottoman territory provoked war across the Balkans. In 1914, when Bosnia had become an Austro-Hungarian province, the assassination in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Bosnian Serb started the first world war.
With Yugoslavia's disintegration, an old Muslim-Croat alliance has revived in Bosnia. Together, Muslim and Croat representatives in the local parliament voted to seek recognition by the European Community of an independent Bosnia; the EC's invitation for independence applications by Yugoslav republics to be in by January 15th left them little choice. Bosnian Serbs threaten to respond by seceding to form their own republic as part of a ""new Yugoslavia"". Local Serb politicians say that they will not live in a Muslim state and that, since Serbs are spread over two-thirds of Bosnia, none of this land can leave Yugoslavia. Muslims, who live all over Bosnia, say they will refuse to be part of a ""Greater Serbia"".
In the mainly Croat area of Western Hercegovina, villages already have sandbag gun emplacements on approach roads. ""If the Serbs want war then they shall have it,"" says Haris Silajdzic, a Muslim and Bosnia's foreign minister.
But few local leaders really believe that Bosnia, sometimes called ""Yugoslavia in miniature"" because of its ethnic mix, will slide into all-out war. Unlike in Croatia, local Serbs have not been whipped into believing that fascist Croats are about to repeat second-world-war atrocities (Bosnian television represents the points of view of all three ethnic groups, so such brainwashing is difficult). They have also been shocked at the sight of thousands of Serb refugees fleeing from Croatia into Bosnia on convoys of tractors. They know it could happen to them. The Yugoslav army, Serbia's army in all but name, is also not keen on seeing the war spread to Bosnia. It wants time to consolidate the third of Croatia it already holds.
The Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, says (like the leaders of Bosnia's Muslims and Croats) that if necessary his people will fight. But he also says that it will not come to that. ""Two or three hundred thousand people would die, cities would be destroyed and then we would still have to sit down and negotiate the same things."" At the eleventh hour, Bosnians are at least still talking to one another."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224168914/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/27?accountid=14657,"Like him or loathe him (as many do), Abel Farnoux fascinates. Officially, he is ""special adviser"" to the prime minister, with particular responsibility for industrial strategy. Unofficially, he is described as Edith Cresson's eminence grise, guru, Rasputin. The 70-year-old bel Abel, as he has been dubbed on account of his studied elegance, is everywhere, knows everything and gives orders to everyone. He goes in and out of the prime minister's office at will, without knocking (his office at the Matignon adjoins hers), and treats her--even in public--in an amazingly off-hand, if affectionate, way: ""Be quiet, Edith! You're talking nonsense! Go and get my notes from my desk, there's a dear,"" and off the normally fiery Mrs Cresson obediently trots.
No one had heard much about Mr Farnoux before he turned up at Mrs Cresson's side after her appointment as prime minister last May. He appeared to have done nothing outstanding in his life, apart from playing a reportedly courageous role in the French resistance, followed by two years in a German concentration camp. He had no formal qualifications, apart from some training as a radio technician, interrupted by the war. He did then climb to the top of Videocolor, a subsidiary of Thomson-CSF, but was pushed out in 1980 when it ran into deep financial trouble.
Mr Farnoux's detractors describe him as an aggressive, arrogant meddler who is constantly stirring up trouble. His admirers maintain that he is a man of charm, intelligence and originality. Mrs Cresson, who has an aversion to France's traditional, smooth, ENA-trained civil servants, is said to have been attracted by his nonconformity, earthy pugnacity and impatience with red tape. She was also impressed by the fecundity of his ideas and his wide network of contacts.
Amateur psychologists reach for deeper explanations. Mr Farnoux's war experience, they say, holds the key to the bond between him and the prime minister. Mrs Cresson, whose own senior-civil-servant father did little to resist the Nazi presence in France, has always had an enormous admiration, amounting to hero-worship, for those who did--including her own husband, Jacques, and Francois Mitterrand. Like them, Mr Farnoux represents a kind of idealised father figure. He amuses, flatters and reassures her. He is her rock in these troubled times (her opinion-poll rating is plumbing record depths). While others begin to doubt, he maintains total faith in her. ""She is France's peacetime Churchill,"" he says.
Apart from his title of ""special adviser"", Mr Farnoux has no official status. He is not part of Mrs Cresson's cabinet; he is not paid by the prime minister's office; he is accountable to no one save Mrs Cresson herself. Yet at one time he appeared almost to be acting like a second prime minister, even making public announcements in her stead, which later often had to be denied.
It was creating chaos. President Mitterrand apparently decided that things had gone too far. Word was sent down from the Elysee that Mr Farnoux was to be curbed, or at least kept more in the background. This has now been done. But he continues to influence big policy decisions (such as the restructuring of France's hi-tech industries, see page 64) and to be the man who matters most at the Matignon."

Or so lots of people in Brandenburg, eastern Germany's largest state, like to think. Since the rebirth in 1990 of Brandenburg (once the launching-pad of Prussian expansion), there has been much rediscovery and resurrecting of the past.
After decades of derision, being Prussian is back in fashion. Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital and the Prussian kings' answer to Versailles, has become a magnet for the fashionable and nostalgic. Last summer Frederick the Great's remains were returned to Potsdam in a pompous ceremony evocative of old Prussia. Politicians in eastern Germany now openly express their admiration of the Prussian values of modesty, honesty and, they say, tolerance (they keep quiet about Prussian militarism).
Brandenburgers would do well to leave pomp and nostalgia to one side and concentrate on two other Prussian qualities--pragmatism and thrift. Their Land (state), like all the others in eastern Germany, is struggling with the legacy of its communist past. Industry is unproductive, agriculture uncompetitive (most of the land is poor). The energy industry, the most polluting in the east, needs costly restructuring; mining of brown coal has played havoc with the local environment and the locals' lungs. Added to this are more recent woes. Unemployment among Brandenburg's 2.6m people is 11.7%. Racist violence is rising, especially along the border with Poland. Brandenburg seems to have been dealt a rotten hand by man and nature.
True, but for two aces. One is Berlin. Brandenburg surrounds Germany's capital (which for the moment remains an independent Land) and is already feeling the benefits now that the Wall has one. Brandenburg is selling itself as the ideal place from which to supply the growing Berlin market. It also provides the space for Berlin's expected expansion. The capital's future airport will be in Brandenburg, probably at Schonefeld, which used to service East Berlin. With Berlin's property prices soaring and its planning restrictions on industry tight, many investors are turning to Brandenburg instead. Mercedes, BMW and Siemens have already settled in Berlin's sprawling commuter belt. West Berliners now covet weekend homes on the lakes dotted across Brandenburg. Applications to build golf courses (as many as 50, rumour has it) are pouring in.
Brandenburg is thus set to become the supply base and the play area for Berlin. Both Manfred Stolpe, Brandenburg's premier, and his Berlin counterpart, Eberhard Diepgen, are in favour of eventual union between the two states.
Brandenburg's other ace is Mr Stolpe himself. A Social Democrat with a worthy and apparently untainted background in the church and the civil-rights movement, he has emerged as eastern Germany's most respected politician. A conservative rival wryly observes: ""There are no real political parties in Brandenburg, just Stolpe.""
Just as well. The fractious coalition of Social Democrats, Free Democrats (liberals) and Greens that Mr Stolpe leads would probably fall apart were it not for his conciliatory presence. Tensions are especially acute between the free-market liberals and the conservation-minded Greens. With a Free Democrat at the economics ministry and a Green at environment, policy is a sluggish compromise. Some western economists seconded to Potsdam say Brandenburg will never develop a healthy economy if the political bickering continues.
Mr Stolpe dismisses such fears and talks instead of a unique coalition coping well in difficult circumstances. He also stresses the rise in new-company registrations, and his promotion of tourism. He is determined to wean Brandenburg away from the drip-feed of central-government subsidy. On his regular trips around Brandenburg, he adopts the role of the father-confessor to whom people bring their problems. The locals love it. Elsewhere there is talk of Mr Stolpe as a future leader of the Social Democrats, even a future president of Germany."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224169249/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/29?accountid=14657,"Contrary to a widespread belief, no new treaty was signed at the European Community's Maastricht summit. EC governments will sign the text in February or March once it has been tidied up and framed in legal language. It then has to be ratified by all national parliaments (not a foregone conclusion) if it is to come into force on schedule at the end of the year. It will probably also have to go through a referendum in Denmark and Ireland.
The Maastricht legacy is just one of many loose ends Portugal inherited when it took over the EC presidency for six months from a thankful Holland on January 1st. An agreement to extend the main benefits of the frontier-free single market to the Community's seven neighbours in the European Free Trade Association has come unstuck. The deal, concluded last October, will have to be partially renegotiated, after the European Court of Justice's objection that the agreement cuts across its role as the EC's supreme court. The single market itself is due to be ""complete"" by the end of 1992. Yet more than 50 of the 282 items of single-market legislation still require adoption.
Portugal also takes over the hapless role of running the EC's peace efforts in Yugoslavia. Sensibly, the prime minister, Anibal Cavaco Silva, has decided to transfer the ill-starred EC peace conference from the Hague to Brussels rather than to Lisbon. In Geneva the long-delayed GATT talks await the kiss of life--or death--from the Community.
All this would be enough to pack a presidency (especially if, like Portugal, you are doing the job for the first time). But Portugal must also lead the negotiations on the future size and shape of the EC's budget. At Maastricht the Community's leaders set the policies and the priorities; the Twelve must now decide how much they are willing to pay for them. Spain and the other poorer members may refuse to ratify the Maastricht deal unless the new budget structure clearly provides for the transfer of extra resources from rich to poor as agreed at the summit.
Portugal's prime goal is to secure budget reform at the June summit in Lisbon at the end of its presidency. Success would clear the way for ratification of the Maastricht treaty by year-end. It would also enable entry negotiations with Austria and Sweden to open under the British presidency in the second half of the year. But success at Lisbon is probably wishful thinking.
The thrust of the latest budget reform is the same as earlier ones: to reduce farm spending, channel more money towards regional and social development and ensure that the poorer countries do not pay in more than they get out. The budget for 1992 totals 66 billion ecus ($86 billion), which is just under the current budget ceiling of 1.2% of the Community's GDP.
The European Commission suggested raising the ceiling to 1.4% or 1.5% of GDP and doubling the money in the regional and social funds by 1998. The big countries--Germany, France, Britain and Italy--reject these ideas. The funds have already doubled since 1988 to 17.8 billion ecus, 27% of the 1992 budget.
One thing that should be settled at Lisbon is who will succeed Jacques Delors, whose second four-year term as the commission's president runs out in December. He is a candidate to succeed himself unless he is summoned back to France by President Francois Mitterrand to serve as prime minister and save the Socialist Party. The other front-runner is Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister. Mr Mitterrand is said to have taken a distinct dislike to Mr Lubbers for the way he ran Maastricht (leaving the French leader out of the inner cabal of dealmakers). But Mr Lubbers could probably count on the support of most of the other EC leaders.
If the argument over the budget continues into the British presidency, the delay will have a knock-on effect. Maastricht ratification could be held up, enlargement negotiations postponed, aid to the ex-Soviet Union slowed down. But an agreement on the budget at the Edinburgh summit in December would give the next British prime minister something to crow about beyond the launch of the single market--which is sure to go ahead whether all 50 outstanding directives are adopted this year or not."

The upbeat mood belied national forecasts of a gruesome 1992. But then the West Midlands has good reason to feel confident of the future--even if its businessmen are still divided over the immediate outlook.
The latest survey by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce shows that 47% of the city's manufacturers now expect turnover to rise in the next 12 months (see chart) (Chart omitted).
The survey suggests profits will remain flat, but is modestly bullish about exports and investment. A poll by the Institute of Directors has found that 46% of Midlands directors expect a rise in orders in 1992, against only 38% of all British directors.
These figures are heartening in a region badly affected by the recession. Some big local factories, like Cadbury's chocolate plant in Bournville, have ducked the worst of it; and a relatively stable housing market (by the nationwide standards of the late 1980s) has protected the Midlands from the savagery of the property recession in the southeast. But the region's two biggest industries, cars and construction, have taken a severe knock; and unemployment has jumped from 6.1% to 9.4% since the end of 1990. As yet there are few visible signs of recovery. In the heart of Birmingham the only sale on at Lewis's department store is of second-hand shopfittings: the city's most famous store went bust in July.
The motor industry, which accounts for a sixth of the region's output, is particularly depressed. Domestic car registrations in November were the lowest since 1980, and lorry sales are at their lowest since 1945. Until a few months ago a surge in exports, especially to Germany, was cushioning the impact of the slump at home. Rover was selling up to 43% of its output abroad, instead of the normal 30%. But now, while some other businesses are reporting higher export orders, the motor industry's markets in continental Europe and America are shrinking.
Few managers within the industry expect any upturn before the second half of 1992. John Owen of Rubery Owen, which makes trailer axles, has had to contend with a 60% fall in domestic sales over the past two years. He thinks 1992 will be ""very flat until late in the year"". The truckmaker Leyland-DAF has seen a 40% fall in its home sales since 1989. It says the position is ""disastrous"": sales are still falling, a 5% recovery in 1992 is the best it can hope for and it expects to cut 1,600 more jobs in the next two years. Peugeot managers ""see no evidence of recovery at all."" Even successful companies are shedding jobs. Land Rover's output at Solihull has been rising, thanks to the success of its Discovery vehicle in East Asian markets. But it shed 500 jobs in 1991 and expects to lose more this year as productivity rises.
Full of eastern promise
Although the short-term prospects for the region may still be poor, the medium-term outlook is surprisingly cheerful. Edward Roberts, the chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in the West Midlands, talks of a ""tremendous potential for the medium-and long-term future of the region"". Chris Tillett, an economist in the Birmingham office of Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, thinks the 1990s ""will be the decade of the resurgence of manufacturing regions"". Sir David Lees, chairman of a motor-components manufacturer, GKN, says there are ""great opportunities ahead"". David Boole of Jaguar Cars describes the medium-term as ""healthier than for a long time"". Their confidence comes from half a dozen bright points:
* The boost from higher car production. Thanks to Japanese investment, Britain should be second only to Germany as a European car maker by the end of the 1990s. Total output of cars is expected to rise from 1.2m a year now to 2m by 1997. The Japanese will be obliged to buy at least 70% of their components within the EC, and the Midlands components industry could be a big winner. GKN has already multiplied its sales to Japanese firms from L1m ($1.5m) in 1986 to an expected L100m ($187m) in 1992.
* The surge in inward investment. In 1983 the West Midlands attracted just 6% of the foreign-investment projects in Britain. By the first half of 1990 that had risen to 24%. This could well be just the start. More than 45% of all German investment in Britain is now coming to the region, and 200 German companies are operating there. Japanese companies have been flocking in, too--notably to Telford.
* Low labour costs. Given weaker trade unions, the end of national pay-bargaining and a spate of efficiency drives that have kept productivity rising through the recession, the region looks increasingly competitive against EC rivals. Many companies have enhanced their positions in the past 12 months by freezing wages. Rover has tripled its productivity over the past decade: its annual output of 35 cars per employee matches that of most European plants and is within striking distance of the 45 cars per employee that Japanese firms achieve. The company claims this trend is accelerating as it introduces more Japanese practices. Peugeot says local productivity and quality control now compare well with what it achieves in its plants in France and Spain.
* Fewer strikes. In the 1970s the West Midlands had one of the worst strike records in Britain. Since then the change has been even more pronounced than in the rest of the country (see chart) (Chart omitted).
Between 1978 and 1988, fewer days were lost in strikes per worker than in any industrial region in Britain. A recent survey by the West Midlands Chambers of Commerce found only 1% of companies ready to cite the industrial-relations climate as a problem. This is not just because the unions have been neutered; many companies have got a lot better at motivating their workers.
* Better workmanship. The imposition of higher standards by the big car manufacturers on their Midlands suppliers--via Ford's so-called Q101 system, for instance, and the choosiness of Japanese carmakers--is improving quality throughout the supplier chain. Sub-contractors who have won quality-controlled orders have found these often open up markets abroad, since European car companies now single-source many of their bought-in components. Thus local suppliers of seat-belts and springs to Peugeot in Coventry have won orders from Peugeot plants in Italy. There are also signs that workmanship is being improved thanks to better training. The ten local training and enterprise councils in the region are said to be working together well; and far fewer companies appear to have cut their training budgets than in previous recessions.
* The single European market. Industrialists in the Midlands seem gung-ho about freer trade in the EC, even though some will face more continental competitors in their own backyard. A study by Cambridge Econometrics, a private-sector research group, suggests several Midland industries are vulnerable to Euro-competition, especially in engineering and ceramics. But companies are at least talking bravely about the single market as a challenge, and the effect can be seen in many little ways. At the Brasshouse Language Centre in Birmingham, for example, 3,500 people now attend classes each week learning 27 languages--a 43% rise in attendance over the past year--and business classes have doubled.
John Major will be eager to know what effect all this may have on the general election. The West Midlands is a vital electoral battleground. It has 22 marginal seats, all of which the Tories could lose on a swing to Labour of 8.6%. The evidence so far is that hopes of jam tomorrow are helping the Tories. In the third quarter of 1991, MORI polls found that the swing to Labour was marginally stronger in the West Midlands than elsewhere; but the most recent polls by Gallup in the three months to the end of November found the Conservatives had an average lead of 5.7% in the West Midlands, against a national lead of just 1.9%. Hardly cause for Tory celebrations, but a pretext for sharing in some long-term optimism?"

Thus local suppliers of seat-belts and springs to Peugeot in Coventry have won orders from Peugeot plants in Italy. There are also signs that workmanship is being improved thanks to better training. The ten local training and enterprise councils in the region are said to be working together well; and far fewer companies appear to have cut their training budgets than in previous recessions.
* The single European market. Industrialists in the Midlands seem gung-ho about freer trade in the EC, even though some will face more continental competitors in their own backyard. A study by Cambridge Econometrics, a private-sector research group, suggests several Midland industries are vulnerable to Euro-competition, especially in engineering and ceramics. But companies are at least talking bravely about the single market as a challenge, and the effect can be seen in many little ways. At the Brasshouse Language Centre in Birmingham, for example, 3,500 people now attend classes each week learning 27 languages--a 43% rise in attendance over the past year--and business classes have doubled.
John Major will be eager to know what effect al this may have on the general election. The West Midlands is a vital electoral battleground. It has 22 marginal seats, all of which the Tories could lose on a swing to Labour of 8.6%. The evidence so far is that hopes of jam tomorrow are helping the Tories. In the third quarter of 1991, MORI polls found that the swing to Labour was marginally stronger in the West Midlands than elsewhere; but the most recent polls by Gallup in the three months to the end of November found the Conservatives had an average lead of 5.7% in the West Midlands, against a national lead of just 1.9%. Hardly cause for Tory celebrations, but a pretext for sharing in some long-term optimism?"
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139761/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/32?accountid=14657,"Both Britain and America are steeped in gloom. Their economies are struggling to climb out of recession, and their governments--both of which must face the voters in 1992--are growing increasingly nervous. Which has most to be gloomy about?
Britain, to judge by the depth of the recession so far. Its GDP fell in the four successive quarters to the second quarter of 1991, by a total of 3.6%, and was then broadly unchanged in the third quarter. By comparison, America has had a relatively shallow recession: its GDP fell by 1.6% between the third quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991; in each of the following two quarters, output rose.
A comparison of the two countries' monetary policies points to the same verdict. While America's Fed has been making big interest-rate cuts, the British government has been constrained by the need to support sterling within the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM). Indeed, the recent rise in German interest rates could yet oblige the government to raise its rates. Every other member of the ERM has already done so.
As a result, Britain's real interest rates are far higher than America's (see chart) (Chart omitted). Using so-called ""underlying"" rates of inflation--retail prices excluding mortgage payments in Britain; consumer prices minus energy and food in America--America's real short-term interest rates are currently zero. Britain's are 5%.
The contrast raises fears that Britain is stuck with a German-style monetary policy, but with American rather than European levels of consumer debt. Total household debt in December 1990 amounted to 114% of disposable income in Britain--higher even than America's 103%, and well above levels of around 75% in France and Germany. Some economists fear this debt burden, combined with high real interest rates and falling wealth (as house prices tumble), is a lethal cocktail. If yesterday's big spenders become tomorrow's penny-pinchers, so the prospects of any consumer-led recovery could shrivel.
Worse still, whereas the dollar is widely thought to be undervalued against most currencies, many businessmen and economists complain that the pound is overvalued against other ERM currencies, thereby handicapping British exports. American exports have jumped by about 7% in volume over the past year, while British non-oil exports have risen in volume by a paltry 1%.
However, comparisons between Britain and America need not be quite so one-sided as all this suggests. Britain's predicament can be seen in a less gloomy light, too:
* Though real short-term interest rates are much lower in America than Britain, the gap between the two countries' real long-term bond yields--which matter more for investment decisions--is much smaller: 3.7% in Britain, compared with 2.8% in America. American bond yields have fallen less, possibly because financial markets are still wary about America's longer-term inflation prospects.
* American households have fared worse than British ones over the past two years. Their average real personal disposable income in 1991 was perhaps 1% higher than in 1989; in Britain real disposable income may have gone up as much as 3%.
* Though householders' debts rose faster in Britain than in America during the 1980s, so did their assets. Despite the recent drop in house prices, household debt in Britain is still smaller than in America in relation to underlying assets.
* British consumers have already done more to repair their balance sheets than Americans. Britain's personal savings ratio climbed in 1990-91, to 10%, while American households continued to save just 5% of their income. This explains why Britain's recession has been so much deeper even though real personal incomes have held up better. By the same token, Britons now have more scope than Americans to reduce their savings as a share of their disposable income, and so more scope to boost their spending.
Perhaps, after all, the gloom has been overdone on both sides of the Atlantic? Unless there is a double-dip recession, the decline in output since 1990 will have been less severe in both Britain and America than the recessions of the mid-1970s and the early 1980s. True, this is not what you would conclude from reading most newspapers. But blame that on the regional bias of the media in the two countries. Most British journalists are located in south-east England, American journalists on the east or west coasts of America--the very areas that have been hit hardest in the current recession, but that got off fairly lightly in the early 1980s."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136624/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/33?accountid=14657,"Last summer pretty fields of pale blue flowers blossomed all over Britain. Lindseed, whose oil is used for putty, paints and cricket bats, flowered in 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) in 1989; in 1991 it covered 89,000 hectares. Its popularity is the result not of a new aesthetic sensitivity, but of a new price structure.
The linseed regime runs on the same principles as the proposals put forward by the EC farm commissioner, Ray MacSharry, for Britain's biggest crop, cereals. Farmers are paid around L480 ($898) a hectare to put the linseed in the ground. But the price for the marketed crop is not supported by the EC and the free market has been offering only L70-100 a tonne. The costs of harvesting mean that, at the lower end of the price scale, the stuff has hardly been worth cutting, and it has certainly not been worth bothering much to push up yields per acre. British farmers, used to squeezing the last grain out of their soil, are shocked by a support system that does not encourage them to produce as much as possible.
During the 1970s the common agricultural policy (CAP) cushioned British farmers against the realities of life in a declining industry. But since 1984, when the EC panicked about the CAP's soaring costs, the economic pressure on agriculture has been unrelenting. In nominal terms, product prices have generally not changed. In real terms they have fallen on average by 30%; wheat prices are down about 35%.
Farmers have responded by trying to keep production up while pushing costs down. Continued improvements in seeds have enabled yields to continue rising--not at the 5% a year achieved in the 1970s, but at 1-2% a year--while farmers have reduced spending in other areas.
Investment programmes in building and machinery have been slashed. During the 1970s farmers were buying tractors at a rate of 30,000 a year. In the mid-1980s that dropped to 20,000. In 1991 the figure was more like 15,000. The economics have not necessarily damaged production. Ten years ago farmers did not think so hard about spending money. They bought every shiny toy that took their fancy, partly because they were making so much money, and partly because until the mid-1980s they could write off the whole lot against tax. These days people are letting their tractors grow older. But this need not curb production: a good modern tractor has a working life of 20 years or so.
Farmers are also using less fertiliser than they used to. Applications of nitrogen are down from a peak of 1.1m tonnes in 1984 to 933,000 tonnes in 1990. Again, less fertiliser does not necessarily mean lower output. Farmers these days take more trouble to put on no more than is useful, and have learnt how to apply it to best effect.
And farmers are getting rid of their workers. There were around 80,000 full-time farm workers in 1990, 20% fewer than five years earlier. That, of course, is just a continuation of a long trend. But whereas in the 1970s farmers were getting rid of workers to replace them with tractors, these days the farmers end up doing the extra work themselves.
At the same time, farmers are going in for the diversification which the government and the farmers' union have been preaching. Llamas, deer, wild boar, riding stables, golf courses, bed-and-breakfasts and Rural Experiences litter the countryside. The scope for this sort of stuff is limited, however. The conservatism of British palates constrains the demand for venison and boar meat. Only farmers near towns, or in the prettiest areas, can find much of a demand for rural tourism. Anyway, the market for these fringe activities is not likely to be large enough to occupy many of Britain's farmers.
The National Farmers' Union has been trying hard to push the idea of farmers as guardians of the countryside. It has had some success with ministers, if not with a sceptical public. In November 1991 the agriculture minister, John Gummer, whose job in Europe is to argue for lower subsidies, announced extra British subsidies for farmers. The lucky few who live in Environmentally Sensitive Areas--places like the Lake District, Exmoor and Dartmoor--can get up to L300 per hectare per year for preserving their stone walls and hedgerows. The expansion of this scheme will cost L65m a year by 1994, up from L13m now.
But in spite of the diversification and the economies, farmers' incomes have been falling. They are now around 5% less in real terms than they were a decade ago. Some farmers are selling up and getting out, so the total number is shrinking by about 1% a year. Mostly, the quitters are owners of small and middle-sized farms, selling to large farmers with more cash and greater economies of scale.
Since early 1991, though, the farmland market has dried up. People are watching the EC and waiting to see what sort of support structure will come out of the current debate. The proposals are reshaped every few weeks, creating an uncomfortable sense of brinkmanship in the farming world; but their thrust looks likely to reverse the pressures which have been driving British farmers to ever bigger units and ever more tonnes per hectare.
As the MacSharry proposals stand now, big farms would do particularly badly. Although farmers would get up to L150 an acre for growing cereals, on top of whatever they could make on the world market, farms with more than 40 acres of cereals would be required to set aside 15% of their land in order to get that compensation. At the same time, as in the case of linseed, the incentive to produce extra tonnes will be reduced since farmers will receive most of their cash simply for sowing their soil--and payment will be by the hectare.
Since the marginal tonne of wheat that was worth producing at the current (EC-supported) price of L112 a tonne would no longer be worth squeezing out of the earth at a (free-market) price of L80, inputs of land, machinery, pesticides and fertiliser are likely to fall much faster than they have done in recent years. The countryside will change colour: the brilliant, fertiliser-fed green will dull a little.
All the thrills of the market
How many, and who, will survive this change will depend partly on world markets. The current proposals assume a world wheat price of around L80 a tonne. At that level, according to one surveyors' firm, Savills, cereal farming could be about as profitable as it is under the current price-support system. But few others worrying about the future of farming are that optimistic--and anyway nobody has much idea what would happen to the world price, so British farmers will face the uncertainties that are common outside the Alice-in-Wonderland world of the CAP.
The future for livestock farmers looks less uncertain; but, for some, certainly painful. Sheep farmers in particular will suffer. Current ""headage"" payments for animals will be limited to a certain number of animals--possibly as few as 350 sheep on a low-land farm. Here again, the larger British farms would do worst. The proposals would cost a hill farmer with 2,000 sheep something like L13,000 a year. One consequence already felt is a sharp drop in the price of lambs on the open market-down to L20, from L50 a year ago.
But the main factor determining who survives will be not prices but debts. Many farmers have weathered the past few years because they inherited their land and collected few debts. But a vulnerable minority bought their farms, or expanded them, in the good times.
According to Savills, farms are now carrying around L9 billion-worth ofdebt, most of it borrowed by the 20% of farmers who owe more than L100,000. ""The banks are surprisingly unconcerned about it,"" according to Robert Ross, in charge of agricultural sales at Savills. The borrowers are the people who are close to the edge and who, regardless of the efficiency of their farming operations, will topple over when world prices turn against them."

John Major and his chancellor, Norman Lamont, waiting round a dead fire for recovery, shiver on. The sky is deep, moonless black. They whistle in the dark. But they have been at the same tune for ages--""The Green Shoots of Growth"" (trad. arr. Burns). It no longer sounds quite so jolly as it used to. Brrr. So where is that damned sunrise?
Actually, the darkest hour is not before the dawn. The sky lightens for some time before the sun rises. Until the sun starts to warm the voters, the Conservatives must expect to fight an election without that cheery giant, the ""feel-good factor"", at their side.
Mr Lamont is being blamed for the earth's refusal to spin a little faster than usual. But he is a Shetlander, coming from the part of Britain where the winter night is longest. He knows that many of the actions being urged on him are gimmicks. Never the greatest Europhile himself, he must sometimes reflect that the pressure on him from sterling's membership of the European exchange-rate mechanism can be traced back to Mr Major, whom Tory faint-hearts prefer not to blame. Meanwhile, newspapers, businessmen and MPS, all of whom should know better, have been urging him to devalue the pound and bring a little light into their lives. They appear to ignore the fact that this bonfire of the government's credibility would probably mean higher interest-rates in all but the very short term.
There was never any question of the government devaluing the pound. Interestingly, the Labour shadow chancellor, John Smith, has one out of his way to emphasise that he is just as hostile to a devaluation, for the same reasons. Nor will there be, as some Tory and Labour MPS have suggested, an ERM realignment.
Those wishful MPS have yet to grasp how much European politics has changed. There is the obvious point about Germany's economic agenda dictating British policies--some ministers say privately that the timing of Britain's entry into the ERM (under Mr Major) has proved dreadful. But French politics has also had its effect. President Mitterrand would not tolerate a devaluation of the franc against the D-mark, since it would undercut one of his few successes; and a general realignment would contradict the presentation of Maastricht as a successful leap towards monetary union.
So, no soft options for the spineless. Mr Lamont and Mr Major, who have been in frequent contact in the past week, have been stiffening one another's nerves for a half-point rise in interest rates soon if sterling falls to the bottom of its ERM band and if intervention by the Bundesbank and the Bank of England fails. Downing Street accepts that this will bring down apoplectic denunciations from the devaluers and will require Mr Major to postpone a general election from April or May until June. psychologically, the decision has already been taken.
But Mr Lamont, despite what some Tory backbenchers may think, is not set on political suicide. He is now turning his attention to the budget. Treasury men say he is disinclined to follow most of the wheezes so far mooted for boosting growth. He is not keen on unfreezing local councils' receipts from housing sales to encourage a building boom. There is nothing more he can do for the housing market. Any meaningful rise in capital allowances to prompt industrial investment would have to be accompanied by a return to corporation tax at 50% or more; so that is unlikely.
Politically, Tory MPS expect a lot from Mr Lamont in March. Economically, he knows it would be wiser to deliver little. Does it all point to an insubstantial, salesman's budget? Not necessarily. There are faint signs that Mr Lamont is preparing for a more active fiscal policy to balance his interest-rate firmness. Senior ministers make much of the argument that the Thatcherite totem of a balanced budget appeared only late in her rule, when surpluses occurred almost by accident.
Indeed, they ask, what is a balanced budget? Does it mean that in a cycle which contains more lean years than fat ones, the fat years of debt repayment should make up all the deficit spent by the government in the lean years? Or does it simply imply some repayment when possible? Many economists argue that in a growing economy, with modest inflation, an overall deficit of up to 1% of GDP can count as balanced. Ministers cite these arguments with approval--it could even be that Mr Lamont will decide to devote some of his budget speech to them.
There seems little point in the Treasury pursuing such arcana unless to prepare the way for a loosening of fiscal policy. The so-called stabilisers (the extra deficit incurred automatically by governments during recessions, on social-security spending and lost revenues) account for most of the current deficit. Mr Lamont was an early believer that these costs should be automatically accepted in recessionary years. But that battle has been won. So Treasury interest in the theology of balanced budgetry may, after all, herald some March tax-cutting. If so, it would seem more consistent with Tory policy to cut income taxes than VAT.
An income-tax cut would carry terrible risks. However much Mr Lamont went on about the need for a fiscal stimulus and the consistency of Tory tax policies, it would look like a last-minute bribe. Mr Lamont is ideologically fastidious and despises pre-election gimmickry. Yet the pressures on him to do something (not least, one suspects, from his more politically minded leader) are great. For Mr Lamont personally, his most dangerous period comes now, in the lead-up to the budget. He played a chief role in ensuring that the cautious Mr Major did not go early to the country--something the party is unlikely to forget. To the electorate, he has seemed to spot recovery once too often already. So long as it fails to appear, he will grow even less popular.
Mostly, this is beyond his control. But his faintly indolent image has hardly helped. Laisser-faire chancellors ought, like Nigel Lawson, to compensate for their economics with an impression of relentless activity and turbulent thought. Otherwise, popular prejudice turns the laisser-faire chancellor into the ""do-nothing chancellor""--even the whistling chancellor. That would be unfair to Mr Lamont, whose inactivity is the result of strongly-held beliefs. Sometimes, the bravest thing to do is nothing."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136746/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/35?accountid=14657,"From his 22nd-floor office on top of the four giant cylinders that make up BMW's headquarters, Eberhard von Kuenheim has a splendid view. As he begins his 22nd year as the leader of one of the world's most successful car makers, a contented Mr von Kuenheim also has a clear view of BMW's future: it will continue making lots of money producing rather sporty, prestige cars while diversifying into a new line of jet-aircraft engines. But a strategy of more of the same may not be enough to sustain BMW's fortunes in cars, given recent changes in the industry. And diversifying into aerospace has already failed for a number of other car makers.
Although BMW roared into the 1990s, the road ahead could be hazardous. For years BMW has exploited (and contributed to) Germany's reputation for top-quality engineering, charging premium prices for cars that provide more performance, luxury or just plain one-upmanship than mass-produced models. In America, BMW cars are priced from about $20,000 to more than $70,000. The smallest and cheapest range, the 3-series, accounts for roughly half the company's worldwide sales.
It was once thought that a fancy pedigree such as BMW's was necessary to enter the upper reaches of the car market. When famous car marques like Jaguar, Lotus, Alfa Romeo and Saab could not afford to develop new models, they were snapped up by big European and American car makers keen to acquire up-market brands. But Japan's car makers took a different route. Some, like Mazda and Mitsubishi, used their own names on new luxury and performance models, while others invented new brands, like Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti.
In the big but troubled American market, the Japanese have shown it is products rather than brands that win sales. Unlike some producers such as Porsche or Jaguar--who have seen their American sales cut almost in half--BMW escaped the downturn with only minor injuries. Yet BMW's American sales still fell by 15% in the 11 months to the end of November, to 47,800 cars. Compare that with Lexus, which saw its American sales climb by 10% in the same period, to 62,500, and with Infiniti, whose sales soared by over 50%, to 32,700. For BMW the rapid success of the Japanese in the luxury end of the market is ominous.
BMW has been helped by a boom in car sales in Germany (see box on next page). But that is coming to an end. The lifting of import quotas in Britain, Italy, France and Spain, and the opening of more Japanese-owned car plants in Western Europe, will give the Japanese a greater run at the EC's car markets. BMW also has competitors to worry about closer to home. Although General Motors is in trouble in America, its European operations (called Opel in Germany) have been revitalised. It now owns 50% of Sweden's Saab, whose cars will be aimed directly at the kind of affluent, quality-conscious buyers that are BMW's natural customers. Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary has similar ambitions; its futuristic prototypes hogged the limelight at the Frankfurt motor show in September.
Mr von Kuenheim, who at 62 is the longest-serving chief executive in the motor industry, remains unperturbed. Though he sometimes talks in riddles, his strategy seems to be to concentrate on BMW's existing niche in pedigree cars and excel at it, rather than try to chase Daimler-Benz, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, into the realms of heavyweight luxury. Daimler is bigger and wealthier, and has recently drawn flak for launching large and expensive cars into a world that is ever more conscious of fuel-economy and ecology.
BMW is cannily trying to shed its yuppie image and snuggle up to the family and the environment. The company already makes recyclable cars and, at its new DM1 billion ($660m) R&D centre, is concentrating on making its cars much greener, more efficient and safer. This could mean BMW will make a smaller car--but not a small, cheap car to compete against the mass-produced models which already jam Europe's roads. There could be a market for fancy, high-priced versions of small cars, and eventually top-range electric ones, too. As for rumours that BMW might buy another car maker, such as Germany's Porsche or Britain's Rolls-Royce, Mr von Kuenheim asks: ""What for?"" After all, BMW already makes a sports car--the Z1--without having to put Porsche's badge on the front.
All the world's car firms are already linked through a web of equity stakes, joint ventures or alliances. All except BMW, that is. ""Who can help us without transferring their problems to us?"" says Mr von Kuenheim. The company has never sought to spread itself across the whole car business. Nevertheless, such splendid isolation may mean that BMW will forgo some fast-growing markets, like those for four-wheeldrive sports vehicles or minivans where even giants like Volkswagen and Ford have teamed up to save costs.
Yet there is one partnership BMW is keen to foster. In July 1990 it set up a joint venture with Britain's Rolls-Royce--the aerospace company, not the car maker (which is owned by Vickers). The two plan to produce a new family of jet-aircraft engines. BMW sees this as returning to its roots. It made Germany's first gas-turbines during the war, and aircraft engines until 1965: the BMW emblem is based on a rotating propeller.
The two companies aim to make a joint investment of about DM1 billion over ten years and to open a factory near Berlin. Initially it will develop a small jet engine to power 130-seater ""regional"" jets, for which there could be a big market. About a dozen such aircraft are on drawing boards worldwide, including one at Daimler's aerospace subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace. Success will depend upon finding the right aircraft for BMW Rolls-Royce's new engine to power. So far, no aircraft makers have signed up.
BMW talks of synergies between cars and aerospace, even though firms as diverse as GM, British Aerospace, Saab and Ford have failed to find them. Many industry experts believe it would be better for car makers to put all their efforts into improving manufacturing productivity and quality, as Japanese firms are doing. In a recent review of the German car industry, Frankfurt's BHF-Bank said: ""The crumbling of the much-praised 'quality-edge' of German manufacturers (with the Japanese moving up market) shows that competitive advantages have to be continually renewed. Innovations in production processes represent the particular challenge of the 1990s.""
Yet Mr von Kuenheim dangerously insists that Japanese manufacturing methods are something unique to Japan. After a five-year study, a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aptly described the way the Japanese build cars as ""lean production"", and said the methods could be copied by any producer willing to learn. Mr von Kuenheim says the MIT team did not visit BMW to see how well it builds cars. (As it turns out, they did visit BMW, but Mr von Kuenheim did not know about it.)
Despite its almost flawless performance over the past decade, BMW cannot afford to stumble because it is a small producer. Mistakes in the capital-intensive car industry can be horribly costly. BMW sales in 1991 grew by 11% to DM3O billion and net profits will top 1990's record of DM696m. That was a sterling performance in a tough world market. But the company made a mere 550,000 vehicles, compared with more than 7m at General Motors, 4.5m at Toyota, and 3m at Volkswagen.
Daniel Jones, a professor of motor-industry management at Britain's Cardiff Business School and one of the MIT team, says that, despite all the risks ahead, BMW would have a bright future as the ""Honda of Europe"". Although Honda makes almost four times as many cars as BMW, the two have plenty in common. Both rely on foreign markets and have reputations as fine engine-builders. Both also make motorcycles. To thrive, though, they must stay innovative, bold and nimble. That is not easy. A year ago Honda stumbled with a range of bland new models. The company's new president, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, is having to undertake a big shake-up. Mr von Kuenheim's aloofness implies that a similar job may await his successor.
Danke schon, Trabbie
Bizarrely, some of Europe's car makers escaped the worst effects of economic slowdown in 1991 thanks not to loyal or free-spending customers in their richer markets, but to the eager buyers of used cars in the former East Germany. Following unification, the new-car market in Germany (including the former East Germany) is estimated to have grown by an amazing 36% in 1991, to 4.1m vehicles. DRI, a consulting firm, says this means that the West European car market increased by a respectable 1.7% last year, to a record 13.5m cars. Excluding Germany, sales in Western Europe probably fell by 8% or more.
The cause of the boom is not simply east Germans trading in--or rather scrapping--their Trabants and wobbly Wartburgs for shiny new Volkswagens, Opels and Fords. Some have managed to buy new cars, but many more have bought second-hand models: Mercedes and BMWs are especially popular. McKinsey, a firm of management consultants, says demand for about 1m used cars from the West by east Germans has sent used-car prices in western Germany soaring. This prompted hundreds of thousands of west Germans to trade in their cars earlier than usual in order to buy a new model.
This, in turn, allowed car makers across Europe to offset the slump in other markets by selling more vehicles in Germany. The boom also sucked in used cars from outside Germany. By autumn 1991 sales in Germany began to slow because of rising unemployment, increased taxes and higher interest rates. DRI expects Germany's new-car sales to fall by 19% this year, to 3.3m vehicles. Car makers hope this heavy blow will be cushioned by increased sales in other European markets as they shrug off recession.
If that does not happen, what about repeating the German trick elsewhere? McKinsey reckons a shortage of hard currency, together with government protection of domestic car makers, means that the east German car boom is unlikely to be mirrored anywhere else in Eastern Europe."

His enthusiasm mirrors Motorola's obsession with all thins to do with quality, born of defeats at the hands of the Japanese in televisions, car radios and memory chips in the 1970s and 1980s. The company's quality crusade has paid off. The reliability of its radio-pagers, for instance, has won Motorola the biggest share even of the fiercely competitive Japanese market.
Motorola's target for 1992 (set in 1987) was to achieve defect rates of 3.4 per million components manufactured. The company freely admits that it has missed that overall target (although in some tasks, such as soldering, it has hit it), and at present averages around 40 defects per million. But that compares with a rate of 6,000 per million just five years ago--an improvement which Motorola believes has saved it $700m in manufacturing costs over the period. That is equivalent to 6.4% of the firm's revenues in 1990.
The company's next goal is to cut manufacturing defects by 90% every two years throughout the 1990s, and to instil the same ethos of rigorous quality in all its non-manufacturing operations--a move Mr Buetow reckons could save $1 billion in non-manufacturing costs during the decade. By 2001 Motorola hopes it will be on course for an astonishing rate of one defect per billion.
Such ambitious numbers make nice, visible targets. But getting the numbers right is only a start. Motorola is gradually realising that it will stay ahead only if it can rasp and perfect a new set of ideas about quality.
* First is that quality is in the eye of the customer. Even if Motorola's cellular telephones are more reliable than a rival manufacturer's, that could be irrelevant if the customer is more interested in comparing the performance of all cellphones with that of the wire-based telephone in his home. To try to understand what matters to its customers, Motorola has started grading them. Those identified as the most demanding are then questioned in detail about their quality needs--and when they buy their next product the process is repeated. ""Quality"", notes Mr Buetow, ""has to do something for the customer."" Transfixed by its quest to cut defect rates, Motorola has not always understood this point.
* Motorola is also becoming a keen disciple of robust quality, an idea developed by Genichi Taguchi, a Japanese management expert. Most quality-conscious firms--including Motorola--have tended to set themselves narrow manufacturing tolerances, but then accepted a lot of random variation within those tolerance. Better, says Mr Taguchi, to forget tolerances and make a consistent effort to hit the target at which you are aiming. Even if it is missed, it will be missed consistently--and consistent deviations are the easiest to correct. The pay-offs are falling costs and shorter manufacturing times.
No amount of on-line control of manufacturing processes will achieve this, says Mr Taguchi. Instead, products have to be designed for robust quality from the outset. Motorola is trying to do that. The firm's tiny MicroTAC foldable cellphone has only one-eighth the number of parts contained in its original 1978 portable telephone; components snap together instead of being joined by screws or fasteners; and the company is trying to make its manufacturing variances more consistent on each component.
* Cutting the ""learning cycle"". In most of Motorola's markets, product cycles are shortening rapidly. That poses two big challenges. One is to get quality right first time: if a product is on the shelves for only six months, there is no time to correct defects discovered by customers. This spawns a second challenge: to transfer what has been learnt about quality from old tasks (ie, making last year's cellphone model) to new tasks (ie, making this year's). This is especially demanding in high-tech industries, where this year's model may use entirely different technology from last year's.
Motorola says it is spending a lot of time on ""learning how to learn"". Gerry Lenk, director of quality at Motorola's cellular group, muses that one way to speed up the quality learning-process may be to get roving teams of design and process engineers to sit in on the development of various products; beyond that, Motorola has, as yet, few concrete answers.
* Redundancy. Motorola's 68040 microprocessor chip contains 1.2m transistors; in a decade's time, reckons Mr Buetow, such chips will have up to 10 billion. This means that even a one-in-a-billion component-failure rate will mean a lot of dud chips. To get round this, Motorola believes it will have to start building ""redundancy"" into such products: spare capacity, alternative signal paths and so on. This will increase unit costs and manufacturing complexity; but it will also boost quality as viewed by the customer.
* Pushing responsibility down the ranks of the organisation is a fad beloved of business schools. Motorola already spends $30m a year on training employees to meet its stringent quality targets. But the company believes it must not only make each of its employees responsible for quality, it must also do the same to the 10,000 suppliers which make one-third of the firm's components. Mr Lenk speaks of establishing quality partnerships with suppliers. Any that are reluctant to adopt Motorola's quality targets simply lose the company's custom.
Motorola denies that its obsession with quality has any snag. But some analysts believe that, because it spends so much time chasing perfection, Motorola's products are sometimes late to market--an accusation levelled at the firm's 68040 chip, which went on sale well behind schedule. Mr Buetow denies the delay was caused by perfectionism: ""Our customers kept wanting more from the chip--and that so of moving target makes it hard to release on schedule.""
More worrying for Motorola is that quality is increasingly only ""a ticket to the game"", rather than a strategy for winning it. Japanese companies, say some management gurus, have ""one beyond quality"", ranking it behind factors like swift product-development times, turnover of work in progress and low selling prices in their manufacturing priorities. Motorola is at the mercy of more than just quality."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224176367/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/37?accountid=14657,"""I have never met a quality guru I didn't like,"" says Richard Buetow, director of quality at Motorola, an American telecoms and electronics giant. His enthusiasm mirrors Motorola's obsession with all things to do with quality, born of defeats at the hands of the Japanese in televisions, car radios and memory chips in the 1970s and 1980s. The company's quality crusade has paid off. The reliability of its radio-pagers, for instance, has won Motorola the biggest share even of the fiercely competitive Japanese market.
Motorola's target for 1992 (set in 1987) was to achieve defect rates of 3.4 per million components manufactured. The company freely admits that it has missed that overall target (although in some tasks, such as soldering, it has hit it), and at present averages around 40 defects per million. But that compares with a rate of 6,000 per million just five years ago--an improvement which Motorola believes has saved it $700m in manufacturing costs over the period. That is equivalent to 6.4% of the firm's revenues in 1990.
The company's next goal is to cut manufacturing defects by 90% every two years throughout the 1990s, and to instil the same ethos of rigorous quality in all its non-manufacturing operations--a move Mr Buetow reckons could save $1 billion in non-manufacturing costs during the decade. By 2001 Motorola hopes it will be on course for an astonishing rate of one defect per billion.
Such ambitious numbers make nice, visible targets. But getting the numbers right is only a start. Motorola is gradually realising that it will stay ahead only if it can grasp and perfect a new set of ideas about quality.
* First is that quality is in the eye of the customer. Even if Motorola's cellular telephones are more reliable than a rival manufacturer's, that could be irrelevant if the customer is more interested in comparing the performance of all cellphones with that of the wire-based telephone in his home. To try to understand what matters to its customers, Motorola has started grading them. Those identified as the most demanding are then questioned in detail about their quality needs-and when they buy their next product the process is repeated. ""Quality"", notes Mr Buetow, ""has to do something for the customer."" Transfixed by its quest to cut defect rates, Motorola has not always understood this point.
* Motorola is also becoming a keen disciple of robust quality, an idea developed by Genichi Taguchi, a Japanese management expert.

After five years of false dawns, the Uruguay round of global trade talks could yet succeed. True, the latest attempt to stitch together an agreement is already being torn apart by squabbling. But the impetus for a deal remains. Intransigence among participants could still lead to failure, but one over-arching fact counts in the round's favour: though some governments would not do much to save the round, no single country wants to be blamed for destroying it.
Trade delegates will next meet in Geneva on January 13th, when they will deliver their opinions on a 436-page proposed agreement published at the end of 1991 by Arthur Dunkel, the long-suffering director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the umbrella organisation for the talks. Much of Mr Dunkel's document is no longer controversial. Deals have already been informally agreed in all manner of fields from services and intellectual property to textiles and tropical products. Disagreements remain over the rules against the ""dumping"" of low-priced manufactured exports and farming subsidies. In comparison with the big issues already agreed, these are mere details.
Sadly, that does not make them insignificant. The French dismissed Mr Dunkel's work even before its pages had been bound and distributed. Both Japan and America hurriedly listed their own long-standing gripes. Yet even this disappointing reception should not be given too much weight. France's gesture meant that, in effect, the negotiations were still open: there was then no point in other countries showing their hands by declaring their readiness to live with Mr Dunkel's compromise.
That said, Mr Dunkel has failed to close the gap between Europe and America over farm trade. Two awkward differences remain. One, which might be bridged with some hard bargaining, concerns the volume of subsidised wheat that European farmers will be able to export. The other, more intractable problem is the direct payments to farmers as compensation for cuts in the support price of grain, which will be part of the European Community's 1992 reform of its costly policy of farm supports. Mr Dunkel's text calls for these direct payments to be cut because they distort production. EC agricultural ministers, pressed hard by angry farmers, refuse to accept this.
Nevertheless there is reason to hope that a deal is possible. Only France has rejected outright Mr Dunkel's text. Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, is pressing France to be more accommodating, though he is hampered by elections this spring in two German farming districts. If there were a vote within the EC over an agreement along the lines proposed by Mr Dunkel, the best guess of some European officials is that there would be a qualified majority in favour of a deal, with only France and Ireland voting against. Under current rules, France could still use its veto to stop a deal, but even France may balk at single-handedly sabotaging the entire round of trade talks in front of the entire world. If anyone is capable of stalking away from an agreement, it may be the United States, increasingly disgruntled with the EC's inflexibility over cuts in farming subsidies.
The problem is how to force a conclusion while both the EC and America feel that they can get something more from negotiation. It is unlikely that there will be a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" in Geneva on January 13th, as Mr Dunkel hopes. The Uruguay round looks destined to run into February. If so, another threat will loom: 1992's presidential election in America. Inconclusiveness, not collapse, remains GATT's worst enemy."

For American television viewers back home, the giant Toys ""R"" Us outlet will look disconcertingly familiar. But not yet to Japanese: after three years of haggling with government and local officials, one of America's most successful store chains has broken into Japan's famously restricted and over-regulated retailing industry.
There is plenty of evidence that Japanese consumers are ready for bigger, cheaper and more innovative stores. Toys ""R"" Us opened its first store, a 3,300 square metre outlet, on December 20th in Ami, north of Tokyo. Some 1,500 shoppers swarmed through the doors as they were opened. ""We've never had this level of customers before,"" said a delighted Larry Bouts, president of the chain's international operations. Mr Bush will visit the company's second store soon after it opens on January 4th. Toys ""R"" Us plans to open a further nine stores in 1992 and to have about 100 outlets in Japan within a decade. The potential prize is a big one. The Japanese spent Y600 billion ($4.7 billion) on toys in 1991.
Such ambitions, for Japanese or foreign retailers, once looked fanciful. But pressure from America, notably in the wide-ranging trade talks dubbed the Structural Impediments Initiative, has prompted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry to modify its interpretation of the country's Large-scale Retail Store Law. Designed to protect small shopkeepers, traditionally supporters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the law allowed local retailers to block the opening of new stores in their neighbourhoods for ten years or more. Since May 1990, however, local shopkeepers and officials have been able to delay an opening for only 18 months. That was the break which foreign retailers needed.
Yet, as Toys ""R"" Us has already discovered, opening stores does not guarantee success, for size is only part of the firm's retailing recipe. Over the past 20 years, Toys ""R"" Us has revolutionised the children's market in America by dealing directly with manufacturers as well as opening suburban stores with more than 5,000 square metres of selling space surrounded by plenty of parking facilities. These tactics have allowed it to cut prices by 20-30%, and have given the company a quarter of the American toy market. The New Jersey-based firm now has around 497 stores in America and 126 outlets overseas, plus 189 Kids ""R"" Us clothing shops. Altogether, these generated about $6 billion in sales in 1991.
In Japan, however, the company has quickly met obstacles to its price-cutting strategy: the required shift in the balance of power between retailer and manufacturer has proved hard to replicate there. Toys ""R"" Us is managing to sell toys for only 10-20% below the prices of smaller retailers. So far, it claims to have signed 50 deals with Japanese toy manufacturers. But it has failed to persuade many other Japanese toy manufacturers to sell to it directly, cutting out the layers of distributors which make prices so high in Japan. Many Japanese toy companies are tempted to do such deals, but they remain nervous about upsetting their old customers among distributors and other retailers.
Nintendo, the world's top video-game maker, has agreed to sell directly to Toys ""R"" Us, but at prices that will not offend other retailers. Toys ""R"" Us had hoped to offer discounts on Nintendo game machines and cartridges of 40% or more, but now stands no chance of doing this. Bandai, Japan's leading toy maker, is absorbing its three wholesale affiliates in a bid to reduce its own distribution costs, but also to eliminate their objections to a deal with Toys ""R"" Us. However, the wholesale prices Bandai will charge will not allow Toys ""R"" Us to discount Bandai's products by much.
Treading through this thicket of conflicting loyalties, Toys ""R"" Us has wisely allied itself with Den Fujita, the president of the McDonald's hamburger chain in Japan and one of Japan's most skilled retailers. McDonald's has a 20% stake in the Japanese operation of Toys ""R"" Us and Mr Fujita is helping it find new sites. Next he wants to build mini-malls surrounded by huge car parks along main roads all over Japan. The malls would contain an outlet of Blockbuster Entertainment, a chain which has 65% of the American video-rental market, as well as a giant Toys ""R"" Us store and a McDonald's restaurant. The first such mall will open next spring at Sagamihara, south of Tokyo. Mr Fujita reckons that getting Japanese consumers to spend more on toys and videos at such malls will be child's play compared with getting them to try American-style hamburgers two decades ago."

The first of a fistful of new Latin American free-trade areas came into existence on January 1st. If there are no blunders (a vast if), three more will follow over the next few years, preparing the way for a single Latin American trade block. In fact the dream of most Latin American countries is to join, together or alone, with a North American Free-Trade Area of Mexico, Canada and the United States. If the Uruguay round of global trade talks fails (see previous story), building a pan-American free-trade zone could become irresistible.
The first pillar in this ambitious and hurried edifice is this month's free-trade pact between Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia. Peru and Ecuador will join the pact in six months' time. In true Latin style it has been a rushed job: the timetable for this Andean pact was set only after a meeting late last year. The three countries have not even had a chance to agree upon a common external tariff. When they do, depending upon the goods being imported, the tariff could be set as low as 5-20%--made feasible because of a round of independent tariff cuts over the past few years.
Where economies are out of line or out of control, free-trade schemes--especially the most ambitious--look more improbable. Take the free-trade agreement being forged by Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Called Mercosur, it originated in 1988 as a free-trade pact between Brazil and Argentina and was expanded to embrace Uruguay and Paraguay last March. By the end of 1994 it is supposed to enshrine a completely free market in goods, services and labour for Argentina and Brazil, with Uruguay and Paraguay following a year later. But such a grand scheme could all too easily fall victim to the shambolic management of Brazil's economy or a reversal of Argentina's economic reforms.
Two other pacts are in the offing. Central America is trying to revive its common market, which was set up in the 1960s. It collapsed in 1969, when war broke out between Honduras and El Salvador after a riot at a soccer match involving the two countries. The five members, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, decided last July to re-establish the common market by 1994.
Lastly, there is the customs union that was to have been created in 1991 between the English-speaking Caribbean countries under the auspices of the Caribbean Community (Caricom). In October several governments failed, for the third time in a row, to meet a deadline for establishing a common external tariff. Just before Christmas Caricom set a fourth deadline for February.
Given Latin America's record for mismanagement, will any of these schemes really work? There is scope for more trade. According to the IMF, only 15% of Latin American trade was with other Latin American countries in 1990, down from 22% in 1980 and tiny compared with the level of trade between typical industrialised neighbours. In some cases, there are signs of growth already. Total trade between Brazil and Argentina doubled to $2.1 billion between 1985 and 1990.
The real prize is not Latin trade at all. President Bush's call in 1990 for the establishment of a pan-American free-trade area was taken to heart by Latin America. Since 1987 the United States has signed 16 ""framework"" agreements with Latin American countries. In theory these are agreements merely to talk about trade. In practice, they are paving the way for a trade block embracing all the Americas.
Achieving such a goal depends almost entirely upon success of the free-trade agreement that the United States. is negotiating with Mexico. Once this is approved by Congress, other Latin American governments might accede to it, just as new members join the EC. A stampede to join is expected.
""Everyone thinks they should be next after Mexico,"" explains one official in Washington. ""Chile says it is ready to go. Venezuela says it supplies us with oil and is a 'strategic' partner. Panama says it is a 'strategic' partner because of the canal. Costa Rica says its economy is very advanced and it is a cute democracy."" Chile already has a toe in the door: it signed a free-trade agreement with Mexico in September."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224159784/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/41?accountid=14657,"More than 250 years ago Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's finance minister, created France's first industrial champion. With the many-mirrored palace of Versailles under construction, he cracked the Venetians' monopoly on glass-making by setting up a French state rival. Convinced the Japanese want to establish the same dominance over France's electronics industry that the Venetians once enjoyed over its mirror business, the French prime minister, Edith Cresson, has turned to Colbert for inspiration. In December she unveiled a new champion that will include the state's semiconductor, consumer electronics and nuclear businesses. Now she is making plans for Groupe Bull, a state-owned computer maker.
Bull needs help. After an after-tax loss of FFr6.8 billion ($1.2 billion) in 1990, on sales of FFr34.6 billion, the firm lost another FFr1.9 billion in the first half of 1991. By closing six of its 13 plants, axing a fifth of its 44,500 employees and rationalising product lines last year, Bull has tried to stop the losses. But, like other European computer firms, it still relies on tired, me-too products. And though it received FFr2 billion from the state in July 1991, it needs more cash. The snag is that further subsidies will probably be vetoed by the European Commission on competition grounds.
To strengthen Bull's finances, Abel Farnoux, Mrs Cresson's industrial eminence grise (see page 42), is said to want France Telecom, the country's state-owned and profitable telephone company (which already has a 17% stake in Bull) to buy more shares in the computer-maker from the state, which owns 73% of Bull directly. The trouble is that the telephone company is bitterly opposed to the idea of a state-controlled French version of America's recent merger between its telephone giant AT&T and a computer maker, NCR.
Forcing France Telecom to marry Bull will be difficult. Last year the telecoms company resisted government pressure to help rescue a smaller French computer-maker, SMT-Goupil. Moreover, in November it signed an agreement with the state instructing it to cut its debt, modernise its network and expand abroad. Taking over loss-making Bull would make it impossible for France Telecom to achieve these goals. That may be why Pierre Beregovoy, France's finance minister and a signatory of the November agreement, is opposed.
Another solution, perhaps involving several state-owned industrial and financial firms buying small stakes in Bull, will have to be found. But this will not cure Bull's technological handicap. A partnership might. The French would have preferred a European partner, but neither Siemens nor Olivetti is interested. So Bull has recently been talking to several American firms instead, including Hewlett-Packard, Digital and IBM.
All three firms have developed Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) chips, the core of the newest and whizziest small mainframes and workstations. Bull needs this technology, for which there is a fast-growing market. But what will an American firm get in return? A Bull spokesman claims unconvincingly that the company is ""a rather sexy bride"" because it will provide support for its partner's favoured version of a RISC-chip standard for ""open systems"" (which use non-proprietary software and link up easily with rival computers) over competing ""open"" standards. Mr Farnoux took Francis Lorentz, Bull's chief executive, to visit Hewlett-Packard in December. A final decision is expected this month. Whoever Bull links up with may eventually take a stake in the company similar to the 4.7% already held by Japan's NEC.
Whatever it eventually looks like, the plan for Bull is unlikely to cause as big a row as Mrs Cresson's blueprint for a merger between the state's semiconductor, consumer electronics and nuclear businesses. Pierre Suard, the chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, a private-sector telecommunications group, described the plan as ""detestable"", and an opposition politician labelled it ""a pure and simple return to basic and imbecile dirigisme.""
Mrs Cresson's supporters, however, argue that the government is right to support France's state electronics industry against Japanese ""aggression"". And they claim that high-tech know-how is a crucial part of national sovereignty because electronics is ""hyperindustrial"", a term implying that it embodies much of the value added in a range of other industries. For example, the industry ministry reckons the share of electronics in the price of a new, ""intelligent"" car will rise from 16% in 1990 to nearly a third by 1995.
Elie Cohen, a specialist in industrial policy at the CNRs, a French research institute, agrees electronics is a vital industry, but reckons the government's fondness for backing national electronics champions will backfire. In a forthcoming book, ""Le Colbertisme high tech"", he argues that state projects like the TGV express train succeeded because they were guaranteed huge public purchases. But in the computer industry the public sector accounts for a mere 15% of the total market. So, he says, by nursing its high-tech firms on state orders, the French government has discouraged them from competing fiercely in the rest of the market, which has thus weakened them. Even a foreign alliance may not be enough to undo that damage for Bull."

Better to be in front of a chicken, than behind a pig"" goes a Taiwanese proverb. And so it is that Taiwan has no equivalents to Japan's keiretsu or South Korea's chaebol, the big industrial groups which have accounted for much of those countries' long-term investment. Instead, family coffers provide most of Taiwan's start-up capital, and companies remain small and volatile. Quarrelling co-founders often split to set up their own, rival, firms. Sloppy accounting and burdensome debts are the norm. Firms that do achieve financial stability can find their competitive advantage-usually cheapness rather than brains--quickly eroded by bigger foreign competitors.
Microelectronics Technology Inc (MTI), a fast-growing maker of telecommunications equipment, hopes to make a virtue of compactness. Founded in 1983, in 1990 MTI's sales reached NT$2.1 billion ($78m) and earned net profits of NT$290m. Though still small, MTI has been a star on Taipei's stockmarket since obtaining a listing in 1990. The firm has become a favourite with foreign fund managers and earned top billing in government videos advertising the Taiwanese economic miracle.
MTI's ownership history is typical of the Taiwanese electronics industry. Eight engineers founded the company with their own money and bank loans. All of the founders were trained in America. Patrick Wang, MTI's chairman, worked for Hewlett-Packard for 17 years. Mr Wang and his partners were lured home by family ties and by the government-sponsored Hsinchu industrial park outside Taipei. Firms at Hsinchu can import machinery tax-free and enjoy on-the-spot processing of export licences and credit lines. In 1986 Hewlett-Packard took a 23% stake and is now one of the firm's biggest customers.
MTI's success rests on two things--cheap, skilled labour and the ability to find and exploit markets too small or too new for bigger competitors to have discovered. The first bit is easy. One in every four candidates for doctorates in electrical engineering at America's universities is from Taiwan. Back home they work for peanuts. A Taiwanese graduate engineer with three years experience earns the equivalent of about $11,000 a year; his American counterpart earns $47,000. ""Our technology exists in quite a few larger companies,"" admits Mr Wang, ""but we have engineers and skilled technicians at much lower wage costs.""
Finding suitable products is harder. MTI's core business is the manufacture of microwave components. These are used by larger, mostly American, manufacturers to build complete microwave systems which are sold to telephone operators. In 1989 MTI produced the world's first portable satellite-telephone, dubbed the TCs-Lite. A suitcase-sized unit with a receiver-dish that is designed to fold out, the machine was made famous by reporters working for CNN during the Gulf war. George Hou, an analyst in Jardine Fleming's Taipei office, reckons MTI now holds 80% of the small market for such machines.
Not for long. Slower demand and competition from other manufacturers has already forced MTI to lower the TCs-Lite's price from $55,000 a year ago to $48,000. As satellite telephony becomes cheaper and more popular, MTI risks being squeezed out of the market altogether. Motorola, an American telecoms-equipment manufacturer with $11 billion in sales, plans to launch a consumer service in 1997. Already expert at miniaturising cellular telephone handsets, it has the resources and know-how to make better satellite telephones than MTI, and the muscle to market them.
MTI acknowledges this problem in satellite phones, which is typical of its whole business. The trick, says Mr Wang, will be to keep moving into markets ""which are not big enough for other companies to take away."" His latest idea is to design and install ""SMATV"" systems, miniature cable-television networks that link apartments to a single roof-top satellite-receiver dish. With the launch last autumn of Star TV, a pan-Asian satellite service offering American pop videos and British news, Mr Wang hopes SMATV systems will catch on in dozens of Asian countries. And he hopes that, once again, MTI will be there first to meet demand for dishes long before bigger but clumsier porkers even know the opportunity exists."

So do the violinists of the London Philharmonic. Barcus-Berry Electronics (BBE), a tiny audio-technology firm in Huntington Beach, California, is a byword among professional musicians for its electronic musical-instrument pick-ups, the devices that collect musical sounds and send them to an amplifier or to studio recording equipment. This year BBE hopes that it will become a household name with audiences, too.
BBE wants to repeat the neat trick performed by Dolby Laboratories, the tiny firm that now has its name on nearly every audio-tape player in the world. Dolby devised a way to eliminate the ""hiss"" of audio tapes and then licensed its technology to any consumer-electronics manufacturer willing to pay its fee. BBE has come up with a way of electronically restoring to any recorded audio signal the clarity and depth of the original performance, much in the way that computers can now reconstruct a sharp image from a fuzzy photograph. BBE's technology improves even the sound from digital recordings on compact discs. Given the technology's wide range of possible applications, BBE hopes to make its name as ubiquitous as Dolby's.
Recognising that the only way to do that was to become an ally, rather than a rival, of Japan's consumer-electronics companies, which dominate the world market, BBE has spent years wooing them. Since BBE's process was invented in the 1970s, it has been incorporated in various bits of specialised equipment used by radio stations and record companies to help boost the quality of their broadcasts and recordings. But it was not until 1985, when a British expatriate called John McLaren invested $500,000 for a 20% stake in a spinoff called BBE Sound, that this esoteric technology began to look like a mass-market product.
Mr McLaren is a 25-year veteran of America's music business and, more important, a former head of the American operations of Yamaha, a big Japanese manufacturer of electronic keyboards and other music equipment. What he found so tempting about BBE Sound is that, unlike Dolby, which is only for audio tapes but still generates a comfortable $15m a year in royalties, BBE's technology can be used with anything that has an amplifier or a loudspeaker: tape recorders, compact-disc players, record players (remember them?), television sets, car sound systems, VCRs, computers, public-address systems, telephone answering machines, cellular telephones and even headphones.
Since 1985 BBE Sound has managed to sell its gear to a wider range of customers, audiophiles as well as professionals, usually in the form of black boxes to plug into existing equipment. But it still had sales of only $3.5m in 1991. To reach the mass market, Mr McLaren has long known that he has to do two things: put BBE's technology on to a single microchip, and then convince Japan's biggest consumer-electronics companies to incorporate the chip into most of their products.
After years of trying, Mr McLaren seems to be on the verge of achieving both aims. This spring he hopes to have a new stereo chip available that is small enough and cheap enough to appeal to consumer-electronics companies making everything from pocket-sized personal stereos to car radios and telephones. An optimistic Mr McLaren expects to triple revenue by 1995, at least half of which will come from licensing. If BBE technology catches on with makers of mobile telephones and television sets, Mr McLaren should easily achieve this goal.
To make that happen, BBE still has to establish its technical and commercial credibility with Japanese manufacturers. Mr McLaren turned down a broad licensing deal with South Korea's Lucky Goldstar and rebuffed obscure electronics firms in Hong Kong and Taiwan to avoid alienating the Japanese. He persuaded NHK, Japan's stateowned broadcaster, to use BBE technology for some of its recordings to give it cachet in Japan.
This started to pay off when Aiwa, a subsidiary of Sony, signed the first licence in 1988. It now incorporates BBE technology in a wide range of its audio equipment. TEAC has just become the second Japanese licensee. A third should follow shortly. Eventually, hopes Mr McLaren, a first-division company, Sony or Matsushita's Panasonic brand, will license BBE technology and then every other manufacturer should follow suit. Banzai."

Rightly: the idea of allowing electricity-utilities to trade pollution permits makes a great deal more sense than the traditional ""command-and-control"" regulation used to bully power-station owners into reducing noxious emissions. Unfortunately even good ideas often go awry when implemented by bureaucrats or politicians pursuing their own interests. Now meddling regulators from 50 states threaten to turn the trading of pollution permits into a textbook case of how not to curb pollution.
Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, America's power stations face the stiff task of cutting their combined annual emissions of sulphur dioxide--the principal cause of acid rain to only 9m tons by 2000, from an average of 19m tons annually in 1980-85. Old-fashioned command-and-control regulation would have demanded that each power station shoulder its share of that reduction. Yet this would not have been the cheapest way to cut emissions. Because power stations differ greatly in age, fuel and technology, some would find it easy to cut emissions by much more than their share while others would find it extremely costly, and so would have to pass on the added costs in customers' electricity bills.
The Clean Air Act wisely leaves to power-station operators the job of finding the cheapest and most flexible way of getting to the combined national goal of 9m tons. By 2000 every power station in America will have received a number of tradable ""allowances"". Each of these confers the right to release annually one ton of sulphur dioxide in to the atmosphere. Stations will be allocated allowances in proportion to how much they currently pollute.
Station operators will be free to use, sell or buy allowances. Some will be able to slash their sulphur-dioxide output and sell unneeded allowances to others. On the other hand, those with power stations using high-sulphur fuel may find it cheaper to buy allowances than to install expensive new scrubbing equipment. Through this kind of flexibility, a market in allowances could save up to a third of the $5 billion or so that the command-and-control approach would cost each year.
It is splendid in theory. In practice, the parochial interests of the powerful public-utility commissions which regulate America's privately owned electricity companies may strangle the market at birth. These state bodies are free to disregard federal intentions--and they frequently do. Already New York state has said that it is willing to let its power stations sell allowances only to those states ""downwind"", whatever that means.
By contrast, regulators in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia are threatening to demand that their power stations keep using high-sulphur coal in order to secure the jobs of local miners. Such states could easily adopt pricing, tax and other policies to discourage their electricity companies from cashing in their allowances, completely distorting the market for allowances and probably creating an artificial scarcity. New power stations, particularly in the fastgrowing southern and western states, could find it difficult to obtain enough allowances to start operating at all. As it is, fewer than 3% of the allowances are being kept aside for fresh power sources.
Another threat to the market in allowances arises from accounting rules imposed on utilities which usually bar them from seeking a capital gain on their investments--rules intended to stop them abusing their local monopolies in the supply of electricity. Yet a market in allowances cannot function unless some utilities can make a capital gain through their sale or trading. Further, current investment in new capital equipment in some states is depreciated at an over-generous rate. This discourages power stations from buying allowances, other things being equal, and encourages them to buy expensive scrubbing equipment instead, Doug Bohi, an economist at Resources for the Future, a Washington think-tank, warns that, constrained by America's byzantine electricity regulations, a system of trading allowances could cost even more than traditional command-and-control efforts. This might happen if power-station operators were discouraged by regulators from selling excess allowances or if a shortage of allowances holds back the building of new, more efficient power stations.
For market-based incentives to work, accounting rules will need to treat allowances and pollution-cutting investment in even-handed fashion. Here, at least, America's federal authorities have some influence. Many sparsely populated states have regulatory staffs too small to formulate their own accounting rules and are willing to follow a federal lead. More competition among utilities would also help. Current law bars much potential competition. Builders of power stations, (or example, may not operate them. A bill to deregulate the electricity business died in Congress last autumn, but a refashioned bill may be introduced early in 1992. More competition can only make the idea of trading pollution allowances more feasible, and more attractive."

When a bankrupt company has assets and creditors strewn across several countries, confusion can become chaos. Far-flung creditors lunge for the assets within their reach. The company's main liquidators try to lure them home (aeroplanes in mid-flight have been instructed to turn back). Creditors may spend years in court resolving disputes created by clashing legal systems.
Two spectacular busts in 1991--those of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and of Robert Maxwell's media empire--will put unprecedented strains on the world's haphazard arrangements for dealing with international insolvencies, especially since both involved massive fraud. Tidy-minded bureaucrats are already calling for an international code to establish justice for creditors to failed multinationals, an idea with a long but futile history. They will be joined by creditors cheated of their rightful pay-outs by slick lawyers and by courts that prefer their own citizens' claims over foreigners'. Yet, under stress, the system will prove that it has virtues as well as faults.
Already, 1991's big bankruptcies are breaking new legal ground. On December 31st a British High Court approved a cooperation agreement between the British and American administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), one of Maxwell's holding companies and still a going concern. If an American court agrees on January 3rd, MCC will be the first company to be managed under American and British systems of insolvency administration.
The directors of MCC had infuriated the company's bankers before Christmas by placing the company in Chapter 11, an American form of administration that gives managers four months of protection from creditors in order to reorganise. Although MCC's biggest subsidiaries are in America, it is the London parent that cannot service its debts. Two days later London banks pushed MCC into a form of administration far less friendly to the company's managers. Under British rules, creditors take over and decide to revive the company or run it down.
Chapter 11 would bow to the British system under the deal struck by Price Waterhouse, the British administrator, and the American court-appointed ""examiner"", Richard Gitlin. The American court would accept Price Waterhouse as MCC's boss. In return, the administrators would consult the court on asset sales, new borrowings by subsidiaries and other important matters.
The pact, if approved, would be cross-border insolvency practice at its best. According to David Graham, a lawyer at Cork Gully, a British insolvency firm, most international bankruptcy deals are struck among a globe-trotting coterie of specialists. Their ""camaraderie"", he says, makes agreement possible where laws are vague or in conflict.
That spirit gives life to the principle of ""comity"", which guides international insolvencies. In the absence of a binding cross-border code, courts are meant to treat equal claims equally (with exceptions). Sometimes it works. When a Mexican airline, Aeromexico, went bust in 1988, American courts fended off the claims of local creditors to aircraft parked in American airports. Sometimes, though, it fails, as when American officials seized the local assets of a failed Argentine bank to pay American creditors.
In the case of BCCI, comity is taking a beating. Brian Smouha, the bank's ""provisional liquidator"", is trying to persuade creditors--including 800,000 depositors in 70-odd countries--to agree to pool the bank's assets for distribution worldwide. As an inducement, the bank's majority shareholder, the emirate of Abu Dhabi, will put up $2 billion or more to raise the final payout from 10% of claims to 30-40%.
Yet the pool is already leaking. Several American agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department and the banking supervisors of New York and California, have laid claim to BCCI's American assets, the biggest chunk of sellable property the bust bank has. In an out-of-court settlement, Mr Smouha and his firm, Touche Ross, agreed to forfeit $550m of cash, loans and securities plus BCCI's stakes in two American banks. The agencies will then give half that money back to the liquidator.
American officials justify grabbing assets on the grounds that penalties for fraud take precedence over pay-outs to creditors. Yet that principle will be recognised neither by creditors nor by international law. One probable reason why the agencies insisted on seizing the assets is that foreign courts were unlikely to support their claim.
Ordinary creditors are of course enraged. The deal is likely to cut their final payout by at least $200m, though foreigners may comfort themselves with the thought that it also frustrates civil claims by American depositors to local assets. (American creditors will try to overturn the settlement in court.) The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, himself a victim of BCCI's fraud, must wonder why he is contributing billions while America whisks away millions. Nor is America alone: other countries have tried to preserve local assets for local creditors. If many succeed, Mr Smouha's pool will be empty.
Beyond comity
The demise of BCCI and Maxwell has revived an old yearning for a cross-border bankruptcy code. Ever since the Ammanati bank of Pistoia went bust in 1302, stranding clerical customers in the Papal states, creditors have sought reliable rules.
One attempt at code-writing failed in 1922 because the British empire would not join. Efforts in the European Community to agree on two bankruptcy codes--one for ordinary companies, another for banks--have got nowhere. Prompted by the collapse of BCCI, the EC is now dusting off its drafts. The Council of Europe did produce an international convention, but since June 1990 only a few of its 23 members have signed. Even bilateral treaties are elusive: the Reagan administration shelved one drafted by Canada and America in the 1970s.
The most ambitious proposals are the least likely to succeed. Idealists yearn for a treaty that would settle claims according to the principle of ""unity"", under which one administrator deals with all claims, foreign and domestic. Imagine, though, the outrage of a British creditor who finds himself ranked in the tenth of the dozen categories recognised by a French administrator.
Mr Graham of Cork Gully suggests a more modest interim approach, under which various jurisdictions would freeze an insolvent debtor's assets to protect them from local creditors or the bust debtor itself. Each jurisdiction could conduct its own proceedings, but foreign courts would generally defer to the decisions of the company's home authorities. Britain and America already use this approach most of the time.
No treaty can solve the worst problems: judging a creditor's right to security, or coping with fraud. Where agreements are easiest to negotiate--between Britain and America, for example--they are almost superfluous. 'Where codes are most needed, they are least likely to be welcomed. Luckily, vultures don't always get the best pickings."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224141667/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/46?accountid=14657,"Share prices and consumer confidence both say something about the likely future performance of an economy. In America, something is amiss. Share prices ended the year with a rally that took them to record highs. That points to a stronger economy perhaps six months ahead. But recent surveys of consumer confidence and other economic indicators have turned down, suggesting no early end to recession. Which is right?
Investors seem to have few doubts. The vigorous rally was triggered by the Federal Reserve's unexpectedly large cut in the discount rate on December 20th, to 3.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 2,934.5 to close the year at 3,168.8, an 8% rise in seven trading days. Share prices more than recovered the ground they had lost over the previous two months. The market seemed to be reflecting the fact that the recession has been unusually long, but also unusually shallow.
Stockmarkets love low interest rates because shares have to work less hard to look relatively attractive. With banks' certificates of deposit offering interest averaging less than 4% and money-market accounts about 4.25%, the average dividend yield on shares, at 2.9%, looks more tempting--particularly to small investors, whose historic role is to spur the last throes of a bull market.
Individual investors' dollars have underpinned the recent rapid rise in American share prices. It is the culmination of a trend that started when the Federal Reserve began its steady lowering of interest rates in April 1989. As rates have fallen, individuals have been moving their money into ever riskier investments, in an effort to preserve the return on it. They switched out of bank deposits and into money-market mutual funds; then into bond and fixed-income mutual funds; and now seem to be shifting into equity mutual funds.
For much of 1991, individuals were moving their money out of money-market funds and into bonds. Bond mutual funds scooped up some $64 billion of net new money in the first 11 months of the year, according to the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade group. They had attracted only $8.5 billion of new money in the whole of 1990.
Bond funds' share of the total mutual-fund market in 1991 increased from less than 30% to more than 35%, while that of money-market funds fell several points from 42%. (The absolute share of money-market mutual funds remains high because individuals and companies use them for short-term cash management as well as for longer-term savings and investment.)
Less noticeable, but more important for the stockmarket, was the steadily growing stream of new money going into equity mutual funds. These attracted $31 billion in the first 11 months of 1991, compared with $12.8 billion in all of 1990. The difference is immense: for comparison, pension funds and insurance companies bought only $11.4 billion-worth of equities, net, in 1990. The shift of individual investors towards equity-based mutual funds in 1991 created a demand for shares that has helped push up share prices, despite a boom in companies' new-equity offerings in 1991.
Though for tax reasons investors do not usually put much new money in equity funds during December, 1991 may have proved an exception. Many reckon that much of the $6 billion-10 billion driven out of money-market mutual funds in the final two weeks by the Fed's interest-rate cut went straight into equity funds. Little wonder, if true, that share prices have soared.
Too far? In terms of absolute value, probably. With share prices averaging 19 times earnings, the market looks expensive by its own historical standards. And the recession is still there. Companies are not making enough money to justify high valuations, and analysts are slashing their earnings forecasts. At some point, share prices and other leading economic indicators have to get back into kilter. But as Japan's stockmarket showed in the 1980s, the support of investors' money can let a market defy gravity for quite a while."
4-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224165941/fulltext/49A18F854DAE4ACFPQ/47?accountid=14657,"Foreign-exchange dealers had to keep their heads during the festive season: the last two weeks of 1991 were full of surprises. First, on December 19th the German Bundesbank raised both its discount and Lombard rates by half a percentage point--double the increase that the markets had been expecting. This lifted the German discount rate to 8%, a record this half-century. Only a day later America's Federal Reserve slashed its discount rate by a full percentage point to 3.5%, its lowest since 1964. Then on December 30th the Bank of Japan surprised almost everyone by cutting half a percentage point off its discount rate, to 4.5%. Cheeky, but then 1992 is the oriental year of the monkey.
These moves left German short-term interest rates more than five percentage points above those in America; in early 1989 German rates were four points below American rates. Over those three years the dollar has lost almost 20% against the D-mark. It ended 1991 against the D-mark more or less where it began (while slipping 7% against the yen). The Fed's latest cut weakened the dollar, however, and it slid to DM1.52. In 1992 financial folks are asking two questions. Will the dollar bounce back? And will there have to be a realignment within the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM)?
Currency forecasters seem to be in unusual agreement that the dollar will pick up in 1992--which, on their past record, may be the best reason for expecting it to tumble. When the American economy starts to recover at some point in 1992, it is argued, the financial markets will expect the next move in American interest rates to be up rather than down. Meanwhile, as the German economy slows, the Bundesbank should start to ease its own monetary policy. If these assumptions are correct, and interest-rate differentials move in favour of the dollar, the greenback should climb. Several forecasters are looking for the dollar to reach DM1.75-1.80 by the end of 1992.
Predicting that the dollar will take off is one thing; guessing when is much trickier. In one corner are those who expect a second downturn in the American economy and further easing by the Fed. They conclude that the dollar will dip lower before it takes off, possibly dropping below its all-time low of DM1.45. In the other corner are economists who think that America's economy will recover soon, boosting the value of the dollar.
While most economists agree that the dollar will gain against the D-mark during 1992, and hence against all the other ERM currencies, they are split on the fate of the yen. After all the tough talk from Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, the markets were surprised by his latest discount-rate cut, the second in six weeks. They had expected the Bank to hold firm for two or three months longer. The move triggered rumours that the Bank had come under political pressure to cut interest rates in preparation for George Bush's visit to Tokyo, in order to head off American complaints that Japan was not doing enough to stimulate demand and so trim its trade surplus. Is Japan about to repeat its mistake of the late 1980s, when its willingness to subordinate its domestic monetary policy to American interests resulted in the loose monetary policy which fuelled the rapid rise of asset prices?
Not surprisingly, Mr Mieno denies such pressure. But he has proved to be one of the Bank's toughest governors, and his determination to burst Japan's asset-price bubble with high interest rates suggests that the accusations about political pressure may be overdone. With domestic demand cooling, land prices dropping, consumer-price inflation falling and the yen strong, Mr Mieno may simply have decided that it was safe to cut interest rates to prevent the slowdown in the economy from turning into a slump. Stephen King of James Capel, a London stockbroking firm, tips the yen as the currency likely to perform best over the next 12 months. Unlike some forecasters, he expects the Japanese economy to pick up in the first half of the year. Combine this with the fact that Japan is expected to have the lowest inflation rate (2%) of any of the big industrialised countries, and the yen could rise to a new high of Y118 against the dollar by December 1992, from its current rate of Y125, he predicts. This implies an even bigger rise against the European currencies.
So what about the second currency question: will the D-mark's strength force a realignment within the ERM? All the other ERM countries except Britain followed Germany, raising interest rates to support their currencies. The British government may yet have to do the same, as sterling is precariously close to its effective floor against the D-mark. Dearer money is awkward for European governments, to put it mildly: the sluggish state of most European economies calls for lower interest rates, not higher ones. Some economists conclude that mounting strains within the ERM will make a revaluation of the D-mark inevitable.
They will probably be disappointed. Most governments--including those of Britain, France and Italy--claim to oppose a realignment. Moreover the case for a realignment is suspect. According to Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, purchasing-power parities suggest that most ERM currencies are already undervalued against the D-mark. Moreover, a realignment would not necessarily open the door to lower interest rates. After five years of stability within the ERM, a realignment would increase the perceived risk of future devaluations, and so could lead to higher interest rates for non-German economies.
How long will the Bundesbank keep its own interest rates high? Might it push them higher still? By lifting interest rates the Bundesbank wished to send a signal to west German trade unions to moderate their wage demands. On the eve of the rise, the public-sector unions had put in an opening bid of 11%. If (a big if) the unions agree to lower their wage claims and the German economy continues to slow, the Bundesbank may feel that it is safe to start easing rates by mid-year. But while the budget deficit continues to loom large and until inflation is brought firmly under control, any cuts are likely to be slow and cautious.
It is in the best interests of Germany's European partners that the D-mark remains a stable, low-inflation anchor for the ERM. Even so, expect much gnashing of teeth from neighbouring politicians who face imminent elections while their dole queues lengthen."

The year did not end well for Giancarlo Parretti, an Italian financier and failed movie mogul. On December 27th he was taken to a Sicilian prison for questioning about his alleged evasion of 121 billion lire ($105m) in taxes. Then on December 30th a court in Delaware confirmed the removal of Mr Parretti and his associates from the board of MGM-Pathe Communications Corporation, a struggling Hollywood film studio. Bankers at the Dutch subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, a French state-owned bank that has lent $1 billion to Mr Parretti and MGM, heaved a sigh of relief.
In his ruling, the Delaware judge, William Allen, concluded that Mr Parretti had ""insistently and continually breached"" an important corporate-governance agreement with the bank. He also noted that Mr Parretti had not given truthful testimony under oath. Credit Lyonnais said this was ""a sad final demonstration of the nature of Mr Parretti's business conduct.""
Credit Lyonnais had been trying for months to stop Mr Parretti from interfering in MGM's affairs. After the bankers provided his Pathe group with most of the $1.3 billion it needed to buy the studio in November 1990, they began to have doubts about his ability to manage it. He fell out with top executives, failed to replace senior staff and gave his 22-year-old daughter a prominent role in MGM's finances.
To protect its investment, the bank signed an agreement with Mr Parretti in April 1991 obliging him to stand down as head of MGM while retaining control of it. Mr Parretti also agreed that if he had not reduced his debts to the bank to $125m by November 30th, Credit Lyonnais would be free to sell 51% of the studio. The French bank then pumped another $145m into MGM to keep it going, and day-to-day management of the studio was handed to Alan Ladd, a respected movie-maker.
Mr Parretti, however, kept meddling, and on June 17th Credit Lyonnais's Dutch affiliate filed an action in Delaware. Mr Parretti argued that the bank had manipulated him in order to seize control of the company. But the judge said that there was no evidence of this, and concluded that Mr Parretti had failed to comply with the April agreement.
Mr Parretti even tried to intimidate Charles Meeker, MGM's president, who had written memos to Pathe employees complaining of interference in the studio's affairs. In his testimony, Mr Meeker claimed that on June 6th Mr Parretti threatened him and said: ""I want you to understand, Meeker, that I am crazy...I am very dangerous, Meeker. Do you understand that, Meeker?"" The judge believed Mr Meeker. He also said a fax produced to support Mr Parretti's case was fake, though he could not tell if Mr Parretti had forged it himself.
With the odds stacked against him, Mr Parretti kept calling Credit Lyonnais during the court case with the names of investors who he said were interested in buying shares in MGM or Pathe. On one occasion, a bank executive even flew to America because Mr Parretti claimed that Cardinal O'Connor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York wanted to take a $50m stake in Pathe. When the banker arrived, the cardinal refused to meet him. Credit Lyonnais executives also went to London to meet a man Mr Parretti claimed was a Saudi prince. After shifting hotel rooms several times ""for security reasons"", the man lost interest when the bankers inquired into the source of his wealth.
Now that it has won the Delaware case and related ones in Paris and Holland, Credit Lyonnais can look for a buyer for MGM itself. It may have trouble finding one. A bank spokesman admits that ""the value of MGM On the market is really nothing"", and I that it could take years to turn around. That means Credit Lyonnais may have to lend MGM more money soon, unless, of course, the studio can come up with a blockbuster. What about ""The Italian Job, Two""?"

Mr Madariaga should know. Chairman of a large brokerage house, Grupo Financiero Probursa, and now also of Multibanco Mercantil de Mexico, one of the nine banks that the government has recently privatised, he is a goose in point.
Most countries with universal banking (all-purpose financial institutions) built their systems, logically enough, on banks. Not Mexico. Reversing what has seemed the natural order, its securities firms and insurers are buying the 18 state-owned banks that the Mexican government is putting on the block. They do so with official blessing.
The finance minister, Pedro Aspe Armella, and his officials see universal banking as the best way to consolidate a fragmented financial system into groups capable of channelling domestic savings efficiently into investment, and of holding their own against foreign rivals once Mexican markets are fully opened, probably by the mid-1990s. In July 1990 a new law was introduced to make it possible.
But the officials reckoned that mergers with brokerage firms and insurers made most sense for medium-sized banks, offering opportunities to cut costs by pushing more products through such banks' underexploited outlets. The three big banks already had investment-banking and fund-management departments. These are Banco Nacional de Mexico (Banamex), the country's largest; Bancomer, the second biggest and the leader in retail banking; and Banco Serfin, due to be sold in early 1992.
The first half-dozen (smaller) banks to be privatised in 1991 were mostly bought by the owners of brokerages such as Mr Madariaga's. But securities firms' ambitions did not stop there. In August, Roberto Hernandez, who runs Mexico's leading securities house, Acciones y Valores de Mexico (Accival), led a group of investors that bought control of Banamex. (Accival would rank number 30 among brokerage houses in the United States; Banamex, with $29 billion in assets, would rank among the 25 largest bank-holding companies.) In October the owners of Valores de Monterrey, a financial-services group that includes a brokerage firm and Mexico's biggest insurance company, led the purchase of most of Bancomer. Buyers have to hunt in packs to get around a rule that one entity can own only 5% of a bank.
Both banks were bought expensively. A 71% stake in Banamex cost $3.2 billion (2.6 times book value) and 51% of Bancomer went for $2.6 billion (three times book value). With only 18 bank franchises on offer, no new ones in sight, and continuing restrictions on foreign banks, buying was the only quick way into a market which is both profitable and--if Mexico's economic reforms fulfil their promise--potentially dripping with growth.
The average return on assets in the four years before privatisation was almost three times as high for Mexican banks as for those in the United States. Officials, bent on privatising the rest of the banks at high prices, estimate that income from banking services will increase in real terms by 10% a year for the next several years, twice as fast as the economy as a whole. Competition will crimp margins a bit, but Mexico's growing and underserved middle class should continue to provide profits. Whether the bosses of Accival (which has 330 employees) will prove adept at managing Banamex (which has 31,000) is unclear.
Mexican officials embraced universal banking partly to strengthen their financial system. But they had a bigger idea as well: they thought that universal banking would spread throughout the North American free trade zone of which they planned to become a part. Canadian banks were already all-rounders, and the United States looked set to repeal its old separation of commercial banking from securities underwriting.
That has all changed, with the decision in late November by America's Congress to turn its back on bank reform. Mexico now looks all the more attractive to banks north of the border. Some, including Citibank, the only foreign bank chartered to operate in Mexico, cast covetous eyes on undeveloped areas such as credit-cards and mortgages. Equally, Mexico's budding superbanks want to move northward. Mr Hernandez, for one, plans to expand Banamex's operations in the heavily Hispanic south-west of the United States. How each will be allowed into the other's market has still to be resolved in the messy bilateral haggling over free trade in financial services.
The existence side by side of two such different banking systems--one universal, one fragmented--makes the creation of an open cross-border market difficult. Resolving the problem, however, could set an important precedent for broader talks on liberalising world trade in financial services under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, happens to be a key figure in both sets of talks."

A single foreign investor may own no more than 3% of a company; those who have invested through the Korea Fund (listed on the New York Stock Exchange) or who hold Korean shares in the form of depositary receipts may own a slightly more generous 5%. Total foreign ownership (excluding shares held through mutual funds) may not exceed 10% of a company, in most cases; the ceiling is 25% for 46 companies (including well known ones like Daewoo Heavy Industry, Goldstar, Samsung and Hyundai Motor) and only 8% for others (including Pohang Iron and Steel, Korea Electric Power, and firms in broadcasting, press and transport).
The timid welcome to foreigners could not have come at a less propitious time. Korea's sagging share prices and slowing economic growth have given pause to many who once were keen to secure a stake in the next Japan. Local brokers' profits have turned to losses. Estimates of how much new money the measures will attract in 1992 into the $l00-billion market range from more than 2 trillion won ($2.6 billion) to only 750 billion won. Many reckon that most foreign investors will vie for a few blue-chip stocks that are well known abroad and actively traded at home. Cheap stocks with good growth prospects are another favoured target, but these tend to be scarce and illiquid. Heavy tipping of likely foreign interest doubled the share price in 1991 of two-Baikyang, a maker of underwear, and Mobile Telephone.
So far, genuine outsiders seem to be hanging back. By December 30th, 81 nonresidents had registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to open an account to deal in shares--fewer than the authorities were hoping for. Another 402 resident foreigners had also signed up.
Many large fund managers already invest to a limited extent in Korean securities, through country funds, overseas securities issued by Korean companies and other vehicles. British-owned Baring Asset Management, for example, put $400m-500m in South Korea out of its $31 billion total under management. Schroder Investment Management, another offshoot of a British merchant bank, allocates some $120m to Korean securities out of its $43 billion global kitty. BZW Investment Management invests some $30m-40m in Korea, a small portion ofthe $39 billion it manages.
Foreign brokers say they can live with the ceiling on foreign investment, if it is raised rapidly, but implementing it will be tricky. There is no easily accessible information on how much foreigners own of any company. Brokers will accept and place orders, but have to wait for a computer to tell them whether the deal can go through.
There are other deterrents, too. All trading in South Korean shares is supposed to go through the Korea Stock Exchange, with over-the-counter deals permitted only in companies in which foreign ownership is at or above the limit. But foreigners will want to do business with each other offshore. Although such transactions are outside South Korea's jurisdiction, foreign firms worry that officials will make things difficult in Seoul for those that engage in them.
Four foreign securities firms have been granted permission by the South Korean government to open branch offices: Britain's Baring Brothers and Jardine Fleming (of Hong Kong) have done so; America's Citicorp and Merrill Lynch will soon follow suit. Jardine Fleming and Baring Brothers have also become members of the Korean Securities Dealers' Association (KSDA), which charges an admission fee of 1.2 billion won. The point of joining is to get a better deal on commissions. Since foreign brokers are not members of the Korea Stock Exchange (which costs 9.7 billion won), they must place orders through local brokers and split commissions with them equally. If they belong to the KSDA, however, nonmembers can hang on to 70%.
Securities firms were allowed to increase their maximum commissions from 0.4% to 0.6% from January 3rd. Local brokers expect the increase to raise their combined earnings by an improbable 200 billion won or more in the year to March 31st 1993. South Korea's 25 securities houses need a lift. Together, they made net profits of 29.6 billion won in the twelve months ending in March 1991, then lost 130 billion won in the following six months. Their losses are certain to grow unless the Composite Stock Price Index heads back toward 900 from the 610-mark where it is languishing now. Both local and and foreign securities houses are counting on foreign enthusiasm to boost the market. Is it likely?
In the near term, not very. As it opens, South Korea is competing with its neighbours for a portion of investors' Asian portfolios. Many big foreign institutions would like to increase their investment in Korean shares--but only if they are sure they can get their money out again.
Government officials say that foreign investors will be free to take out their dividends and capital gains. Foreigners fear, nonetheless, that the many legal and procedural barriers making it hard for them to move money quickly and freely today may never be dismantled. Foreigners must also pay capital gains tax of up to 25%, and are not allowed to use nominee accounts (Korean investors do not pay tax and do use nominee accounts). Foreigners are unlikely to rush through South Korea's newly opened door, but to hover near, rather as they did when Taiwan opened its markets early in 1991, waiting for red tape to go, prices to rise and profits to soar."

Animals, plants and other multi-cellular Johnny-come-latelies have turned up only in the past few hundred million years, whereas bacteria have been around for 3-1/2 billion years. The earth is only 4-1/2 billion years old; the time between the surface becoming habitable and it becoming inhabited was at most only a few hundred million years. Unless they arrived from elsewhere (which is unlikely, but not impossible), it seems that making bacteria was not too difficult.
People know a lot about bacteria; scientists now routinely design new ones for particular purposes. However, no one knows how they came about in the first place. The origin of life is still a mystery to biologists--largely because its nature is, too. Biologists spent much of the 19th century looking for the seat of life in the tissues and then the cells of living things, but never found it. Chemists suggested that some molecules""--organic"" ones made up of chains of carbon--were naturally unique to living things, though they quickly learnt how to synthesise them. The biologists met the chemists and together they developed biochemistry--and later, with the help of some physicists, molecular biology.
The mechanisms of life are now understood in extraordinary detail--viruses can be pictured atom by atom. Saplings of study are growing into mighty oaks, setting seeds and propagating new trees. But a view of the forest is missing. Biology has settled for observing how life works, without asking often enough what life actually is. This does not matter when the objects of study are uncontroversial, and they normally are. Almost all biologists study thing that clearly are or have been alive. The small band studying life's origin, though, faces the problem in its purest form. To see the beginning, you need to know what it is that has begun.
One of the first to set about this study methodically was Stanley Miller. In the 1950s Dr Miller took simple gases like methane and ammonia (such as might have formed the atmosphere of the early earth) and zapped them with electric sparks, to simulate lightning. He was rewarded with brown sludge: unprepossessing, but not uninteresting. The sludge contained amino acids--the simple chemicals from which proteins are formed. Dr Miller had discovered a recipe for the primeval soup from which life was thought to have emerged.
Others, following Dr Miller's example, have concocted soups which yield further constituents of living things: sugars, fatty acids, the building blocks of DNA, and more or less everything else needed to build a bacterium. And even if conditions on the early earth were not as Dr Miller assumed, astronomers have shown that the ingredients for potage au precursor could have come from elsewhere. Carbonaceous chondrites--meteorites which are thought to be clumps of the dust from which the solar system was made--have been found to contain many of these simple organic chemicals.
A good start, perhaps. But the step from sludge to cells is a big one. A bacterium, though simple by comparison with an amoeba or a human body cell, is still a pretty complicated thing. At the moment, there is only one sure-fire way to turn a bunch of chemicals into a bacterium--to feed them to another bacterium. That is hardly an origin.
LIFE, BUT NOT AS WE KNOW IT
Bacteria are the earliest visible link in the great chain of being. Everything now living is descended from them. But they are not the first link-just the oldest surviving one. The originists' challenge is not to make a bacterium from scratch, but to reforge a few of the earlier, invisible links: the stages which may have been good ideas at the time, but have been superseded.
There is no want of speculation on the subject. The precursors could have been simple self-replicating proteins. Or they could have been nucleic acids--though probably not the most famous one, DNA. They could have started as chemical reactions in tidal pools. Or life could have started out in self-replicating clay minerals, into the cracks of which today's organic chemicals infiltrated themselves at a later date, eventually taking over the mechanism. This is the pet theory of Graham Cairns-Smith, a Scottish chemist. Gunter Wachtershauser, a Munich patent lawyer, has suggested a role for iron pyrites. All fair ideas, but they are not answers to the basic question. There was a time when there was no life on earth, and then there was life of some sort, however bizarre. What is it that changes when life is added to a system?
Today, the difference between the live and the inanimate is fairly clear. Most people can tell a rock from a daisy. Biologists can see a whole set of biochemical features that distinguish life--but they cannot tell which, if any, are necessary, and which are just chance, reflecting the quirky biochemistry of the common ancestral bacterium from which every creature can be traced. A definition of life has to be more general than a description of the biochemistry that life on earth shares.
A rough-and-ready definition, good enough for rough-and-ready biologists, is that life is what living creatures do. School-children are taught (or should be) that living things display seven characteristics: excretion, growth, irritability, locomotion, nutrition, reproduction and respiration. Some living things may be short of a characteristic or two--mules do not reproduce (though the stock they are bred from does), and plants rarely go walkabout.
Non-living things may show some of these characteristics. Crystals, for instance, may grow and even reproduce, but are not much noted for their irritability. Viruses provide a tricky case; they do not necessarily show any of the seven virtues, but they can get other living things to reproduce them. Some suggest that ecosystems are alive in themselves, not just as the sum of their parts. But whereas the seven cardinal virtues do describe life, without too much stretching of definitions, they do not capture its essence, if essence it has.
It may be that life is something that has no sharp boundaries. Today, rocks are rocks and daisies daisies. But there is not necessarily a sharp distinction between the living and the non-living. There may appear to be a distinction today only because the intermediate steps have long since vanished.
The question of whether life came about by a slow progression or a sudden quickening is not just a question for those whose interests in life lie 4 billion years in the past. If somewhere before bacteria there were things which lived but were based on different chemical processes, or if there were things in some sense partially alive, there might be a possibility of creating new forms of life and almost-life today--rather than just altering existing forms, which is what biotechnology does.
What might other forms of life look like? Science-fiction writers have often speculated about life based on silicon, rather than carbon. It is a conceit that rests on elementary chemistry; like carbon atoms, atoms of silicon can each bind to four other atoms. They can form long chains, loops and the like, and thus make complicated molecules. But silicon-based life is, alas, unlikely, at least on today's earth. Interesting silicon compounds are unstable, especially in the presence of water. Stable silicon compounds are rocks. That does not necessarily mean that elsewhere in the universe--or in the clays of the early earth--silicon might not support some sort of life. And another type of silicon life, one independent of vulgar chemistry, may be around today.
For several years, people have been playing with ""artificial life"" In the silicon world of computers' central processing units. These life forms are computer programs which mimic--some would say embody--some or all of life's properties. Artificial life is useful n two ways. It can be used to explore the internal processes which give life to an organism. And it can help scientists study the processes of replication and competition--and their inescapable concomitant, evolution.
THAT WHICH ORGANISES?
One insight coming from these computer studies is that the distinction between life and non-life is probably a sharp one. The buzz-word to describe this sudden quickening is ""anastrophe"". An anastrophic change (the term was coined by Herrick Baltscheffsky, a Swedish chemist) is the opposite of a catastrophic one, a coming together of disparate elements to form a coherent, connected whole. If ten tonnes of twisted metal were to jump back on to the railway tracks, that would be an anastrophe. The master of anastrophic change is Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, which is devoted to investigating complex systems, from the immune system to the world economy.
Dr Kauffman starts from the position that, whatever else they are, living creatures are clearly complex webs of chemical pathways--chains of chemical reactions in which a product from one becomes the starting-point for another. Life is a set of dynamic chemical processes; when they stop, so does life, and the chemicals that once made up a body reduce themselves to a sludge reminiscent of the one found in Dr Miller's experiments. To keep these processes going, the body is full of catalytic chemicals which assist reactions without being destroyed in the process. A pathway will produce a catalyst which helps other pathways, which, through a huge amount of round-about biochemistry, end up supporting the first pathway.
Without inquiring into the specific chemistry involved, Dr Kauffman has been modelling ""idealised"" chemical networks in which substances react together under the control of catalysts and generate products which can, themselves, act as raw materials or catalysts in further reactions. Dr Kauffman likens this to scattering buttons (representing the chemicals) on a floor and connecting them with threads (representing the pathways). Picking up a thread and seeing what else comes with it is like seeing which chemicals are connected in a set of pathways.
What Dr Kauffman finds is that as he adds ""buttons"" and ""threads"" to the primeval soup in his computer, there comes a point where a few additional connections suddenly link the whole thing up. After these last connections, pulling on any thread will bring up all the buttons. Such a network represents a closed, autocatalytic set: though no chemical reproduces itself, each is produced somewhere else in the system. As disconnected pathways grow, there will come a point when such a network forms spontaneously--an anastrophic miracle. Dr Kauffman, preferring the language of physics, sees it as a phase change, like the one which occurs when water freezes into ice.
This is certainly intriguing; it may well also be relevant. Studies of the origin of life can founder on the paradox of proteins and nucleic acids. Nucleic acids (DNA and its relative RNA, long molecules which can carry information) store and transmit the instructions which cells use to make proteins. These proteins then act as catalysts to make all the other chemicals of life, including nucleic acids. Each is a prerequisite for the other--so, like the chicken and the egg, which came first?
A way to break the circle open was found by Thomas Cech, of the University of Colorado, and Sidney Altman at Yale. In the early 1980s both discovered molecules of RNA which acted as catalysts as well as information carriers. This led to the idea of an ""RNA world"" of proto-organisms in which RNA fulfilled both functions. The DNA world of today would have grown out of the RNA world as a written culture grows out of an oral tradition, the DNA acting as a permanent record of what went before.
Biologists are now scrambling to make a self-reproducing RNA catalyst--a molecule with the abilities, given the appropriate raw materials, both to reproduce itself and to make other, different, RNA molecules which might in turn act as catalysts for further pathways. Jennifer Doudna and her colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston have got part of the way. They have produced an RNA molecule which can make little RNA molecules a tenth of its size. A set of RNA pathways could have come together to form an interconnecting web in much the way that the buttons and threads in Dr Kauffman's computer do.
These self-organising, anastrophic systems are potent tools for understanding the nature of life, if not its origin. The idea that order can arise spontaneously is disturbing to scientists conditioned by the second law of thermodynamics. This says that any change in a closed system will make it more disordered. The key word, of course, is closed. Anastrophic successes in bringing forth order are compensated for by increases in disorder in their surrounding. Living organisms are bounded--in fact, that, too, may be part of what it is to be alive--but they are not closed systems. They take in energy and use it to maintain order within their boundaries; the disorder inexorably created in the process is then exported to their environment. People use air and food as their inputs; plants use air and sunlight. The importance of this aspect of life was first described by a physicist, Erwin Schrodinger, who stressed local increases in order as the hallmark of life. The study of complex systems and their sudden orderliness fits nicely with his vision.
THAT WHICH EVOLVES?
The textbook list of life's characteristics omits one inescapable feature: that living things evolve. Early thinking about how life arose did not distinguish between the origins of life and the origins of the creatures around today. God, by creating a world full of living creatures, provided both, normally simultaneously. In the 19th century, though, the second part of the problem was solved by Darwin in a way that had no recourse to God, and also shed no light on the first part. The origin of species was through natural selection. The origin of life remained mysterious. Natural selection can work only when there is already life around. Or can it?
The advent of the personal computer allowed biologists to develop and study new menageries. Richard Dawkins, of Oxford University, invented biomorphs--pictures on computer screens which are generated by bits of computer code much as bodies are generated by genes. The computer causes various minor changes (""mutations"") in the code describing a biomorph, and displays the range of results. Dr Dawkins, playing God (or rather, being a good Darwinian, the environment), selects the member of each generation which he likes the look of, and breeds a new generation from it. Biomorphs like those scattered over these pages can become eerily life-like after a few generations.
But biomorphs, suggestive though they may be, are still a product of unnatural (human)selection, even if their variation is generated at random. Thomas Ray of the University of Delaware has gone one better, and found a way to make his life-forms evolve without outside help.
In Tierra, as Dr Ray calls his electronic ecosystem, the creatures (programs that include a set of instructions which allows the program to copy itself) compete for limited resources: the processing time and memory which they need to exist and breed, which are the equivalents of food and shelter in the real world. Every so often, random changes are made in their genes (the instructions in the computer programs they consist of), the equivalent of throwing radiation or mutation-inducing chemicals at bacteria.
The results are astonishingly lifelike, as the programs evolve strategies that let them flourish. Parasites of various sorts emerged quickly; some used the reproductive sub-routines of other programs to generate copies of themselves, behaving much like viruses. Others found ways to divert computer resources destined for others to their own reproductive programs. Sometimes the hosts developed immunities. Sometimes they were driven to extinction, and the parasites that survived the crash changed their style of life, co-operating among themselves and forming proto-communities. Programs would even exchange pieces of code, to their mutual benefit--the computing equivalent of sex.
Tierra still has a god, though. Switch off the machine and you have killed the world. But computer life does not have to be fragile. Computer viruses are here to stay. They are free-standing structures with a genuine ecology of their own. They multiply, and they can propagate from host to host without help--and indeed in the face of spirited attempts to stop them. And, if programmed in advance to do so, they can undergo limited evolution to help them resist the attempts at control imposed by the incipient immune systems which computer programmers are now designing. Admittedly, they have the advantage of a peculiar environment. Computer manufacturers have obligingly standardised the software in which they breed. Just as crop monocultures can be obliterated by a disease which would barely perturb a healthy mixed savannah, so cohorts of identical operating systems can be devastated by an insignificant little bug.
CHASING CHIMERAS
Schrodinger might have warmed to computer viruses, which are more-or-less disembodied information and are disconcertingly close to being alive. Traditionally minded reductionists may have trouble with the idea that life can exist without being made of something solid and tangible. They prefer to have something made of nucleic acids, protein, sugar and fat in front of them before giving out such accolades. But are they right to be so conservative?
Things that live in fields and ponds share two properties with things that live in computers: they are self-sustaining, and they reproduce the ability to reproduce. Biologists call the self-sustaining structure--think of it as the body--the ""phenotype"", and the set of instructions which tells you how to make a new one the ""genotype"". The former is a reflection of the latter, though the environment may distort the reflection more than a little.
Dr Kauffman and his emulators are playing with artificial phenotypes--self-sustaining structures not in the business of copying themselves. Dr Ray's Tierrans are more like naked genotypes--selfish pseudogenes doing each other down in a central processor. And here, perhaps, is the heart of the problem. Life does not have a simple essence--it is a combination of self-sustaining complexity and reproduction, the second allowing the first to evolve. In the computer, where men can play God, the two can be separated. Complex self-sustaining systems can be created for a purpose. In nature, that complexity can only come hand in hand with the ability to reproduce. Otherwise, even if order does miraculously emerge from chaos, it will quickly vanish again.
Artifice may come to resemble nature more closely. Already, there is a movement in some areas--computer programming is one, biotechnology is another--to forsake rational design for evolution. Rather than trying to outguess nature by covering every conceivable contingency (when you can be sure that an inconceivable one will arise), try pitching a range of programs against a problem, or a range of mutant bacteria against a pollutant, and see which do best. Then let them evolve to do better. Natural selection is no bad way to build a watch.
Will they be alive? That may, in the end, be a matter of taste. It is no accident that biology has been successful without worrying about such thins. Chasing definitions is like chasing griffins or mermaids--such chimeras are fascinating but elusive. When a computer crashes, it does not matter if the virus responsible is thought to be alive or not. If people wish to restrict the term ""alive"" to things composed mainly of carbon-based molecules, it makes little difference; new terms will be invented to embrace the properties that natural and artificial systems share. After all, the chimeras were composites. Perhaps the essence of life is too."

By Dick Leonard. Macmillan
By law, the British are required to hold an election at least once every five years. This is Year Five. Time, therefore, for Britain's politicians and election-watchers to find out what has been discovered about the country's 43m voters since three-quarters of them last trooped to the polls in 1987. Political scientists have been busy.
Much the most technical of the new books, replete with references to ""proportional marginal adjustments"" and ""log odds ratios"", is also the most entertaining. Anthony Heath and his co-authors belong to the school of sociology that insists there is nothing new under the sun. As a result, their study of British voting between 1964 and 1987, ""Understanding Political Change"", has all the jollity of a Punch and Judy show, with Mr Heath as Punch and everyone else in the field as Judy.
Did someone have the temerity to suggest that British voters have become more volatile? Bang! ""They always were volatile."" Is it proposed that voters today vote less out of party loyalty and more on the basis of issues? Wham! ""No, they don't."" But has there not been some increase in tactical voting? Take that, you fool! ""People have always voted tactically."" Okay, but surely the relationship between social class and voting is looser than it once was? Thwack! ""The changes you see amount to very little, they could easily be reversed, and they're perfectly easily explained.""
Unfortunately, Mr Heath and his colleagues use evidence selectively, and they caricature their opponents. Academics and politicians will learn more from two other books, ""Media and Voters"" and ""How Voters Change"". William Miller and his collaborators are as technically proficient as Mr Heath and his, and they raise new issues instead of recycling old ones. Most important, they reckon that fully half the British electorate is now ""up for grabs"", with no abiding attachment to any political party.
Here is the proof: when the Thatcher government in 1986 found itself badly behind in the polls, it proceeded to pull off two coups. By increasing public spending and simultaneously cutting taxes, it engineered a ""winter of sudden contentment"". It also ensured that the Conservative-leaning tabloid newspapers, notably the Sun and the Star, did what they were inclined to do anyway: trumpet the Tories' economic ""accomplishments"". As a result, between the summer of 1986 and the spring of 1987 there was a massive swing back to the Tories, mainly among the unpolitical working-class readers of the Tory tabloids. By the time the real election campaign started in May 1987, it was already over. Alas for the Tories today, there is little time left for such politico-economic engineering--but the tabloids are probably ready to play their part anyway.
In both books, Mr Miller emphasises the bias of Britain's mass media. Some of the partisanship in 1987--the tabloids'--was intended. Some of it--the television news bulletins'--was not. The BBC and ITN meant to be balanced and, according to their own lights, were. But Mr Miller shows that television news tilted heavily towards the Tories by presenting ""the government in action"" in a favourable light. Mr Miller reckons that television bias, as distinct from press bias, probably had no significant effect five years ago; but the same circumstances might produce different effects in a few months' time.
All these books draw on the British Election Study (BES), a continuing investigation of British voters and voting going back nearly 30 years. In ""The British Electorate, 1963-1987"" Ivor Crewe and his colleagues had the bright idea of collating all the BES time-series data and publishing them in tabular form, with breakdowns but without commentary. The result amounts to an election-watcher's adventure playground: 378 enormous tables, some spilling over several pages. Their message is clear. Voters have become less committed to parties; they judge parties and governments increasingly by results. But otherwise their views change only slowly. In October 1974 87% of Britain's voters thought the government should ""spend more money to get rid of poverty"". In 1987--13 years, two governments and three prime ministers later--87.9% thought the same, an increase of 0.9 points.
Two other books, of broader appeal, deserve a mention. Robert Worcester, head of Market and Opinion Research International, describes in ""British Public Opinion"" how opinion polls work and lucidly depicts their past triumphs and disasters. ""Elections in Britain Today"", by Dick Leonard, a former Labour MP and writer for The Economist, describes in useful detail how the British electoral system works.
A theme common to the research is the negativism of modern British electoral politics. Margaret Thatcher was elected because she was neither Edward Heath nor James Callaghan. Neil Kinnock, if he wins, will be chosen because he is not the Tories' leader. Most people who vote Liberal Democrat in 1992 will do so because it is not either of the other parties. Most voters seem reasonably content with the existing rules of the game; but they show few signs of being impressed with the players."

A lovelorn swain is not the best judge of his beloved. Mark Tully, the BBC's veteran correspondent in New Delhi, is in love with India. This makes his narrative gentle, compassionate and even lyrical. It also blunts his analysis.
Mr Tully gives evocative glimpses of the real India through an assortment of stories about ordinary Indians. He takes the reader to a rural wedding, to a gathering of millions of devout Hindus during the Kumbh Mela for a dip in the holy Ganges, and to villages where people are accused of abetting sati, the ritual suicide of widows on their husbands' funeral pyres. He wishes to show that the values of traditional India have been maligned and misrepresented, first by British colonialists and now by the westernised Indian elite. He thinks the English language is a neocolonial tool: as the medium of instruction of all elite schools and colleges, it encourages those students to look down on their own heritage.
Mr Tully is able to see the positive side even of caste and sati. No doubt, he writes, the caste system is inegalitarian. But no system could have lasted so many millennia without serving an important social purpose. Every caste is a kinship society that offers help to distressed people from other members, and thus constitutes a social-security system unrivalled by anything socialist India has put in place.
Some of Mr Tully's barbs are devastatingly accurate; but he is far too sweeping. He says, incorrectly, that the elite believes that everything good comes from outside India. In fact, there is an insatiable demand from the elite for the paintings of Indian artists, Kashmiri shawls and Indian artefacts of every kind. Nor is Mr Tully right to say that locally made goods cannot compete against multinational products because of ""the servile mentality that believes that anything Indian must be inferior."" In recent years multinationals in India have taken a pasting from home-grown competitors. Lever has been hammered in detergents, General Food in soft drinks, Philips in TV Sets, ICL in computers.
Mr Tully need not far that India will be swamped by cultural colonialism. It is much too strong for that. In one fascinating episode, he shows how high-caste Indians dominate the supposedly casteless Christian priesthood, and how high-caste Christians object to taking communion from a low-caste priest. He interprets this as a western failing. In fact, it is a prime example of the ability of Indian tradition to overwhelm western culture.
Booth-capturing at election time is another Indianisation of a western concept. The rule of law ushered in by the British Raj is beginning to give way to the feudalism of the Moghul days. Those in power break the law with impunity; musclemen are employed by all political parties, while those without money or influence lose their legal rights. This attitude to justice, one of the darkest aspects of India's traditions, lies at the heart of the nation's problems today. It is not a consequence of excessive westernisation."

This is a work about ancient history fit to be compared to the best products of the ancients themselves. It combines the curiosity of Herodotus with the judgment of Thucydides, the terseness of Tacitus with the insights of Polybius. It fills a large, long-standing gap in history-writing. It covers life in the western Mediterranean and in south-west Asia From the death of Alexander the Great in 323 to the death of Mark Antony in 30BC. Rome's Punic wars with Carthage appear only at the margin; but Rome gradually looms larger and larger, until by the end of the book Rome has replaced Macedon as the dominant power.
Hundreds of scholars, ancient, medieval and modern, have worked over one aspect or another of the Hellenistic age. No one before Peter Green--a Cambridge-trained professor teaching in Austin, Texas--has succeeded in tying all the strands together into so coherent a whole.
Instead of pursuing the fate of one of the dynasties that succeeded Alexander, Mr Green discusses how these dynasties related to each other and to their Greek, Jewish and Parthian neighbours. He commands both their internal histories, and their inter-dynastic relations; and goes far outside the conventional bounds of political and diplomatic history as well. Mr Green wears his remarkable range of learning lightly. He has mastered almost as many languages as Cleopatra, who was fluent in nine (though, unlike him, she had no Latin), and his book is continually interesting.
Although he does not claim to be a military historian, Mr Green covers all the main campaigns, and observes also how many minor ones there were: over 200, for example, fought in or over Palestine during the three centuries he covers. He deals with culture as thoroughly, and as entertainingly, as he deals with politics and strategy. He sketches out the main strands in philosophy, science, painting, sculpture, architecture and writing, often with references to a much later age. Charles I, for instance, ""may have lost his head because of a long-delayed and violent reaction against theories first propounded by Zeno"" the Stoic. ""Mrs Pankhurst never envisaged a world without maids"" is another aphorism; they help to make the book a joy to read.
Preoccupations then and now included not only alcohol and sex but federal policy, immigrant policy, inner-city decay, mob violence, multilateral wars, pactomania and, above all, sheer greed. This he regards as the main motive for Macedonian and Roman imperialism then, as for much more recent European imperialisms; his book is full of references to what he calls ""the flawed, self-seeking nature of our common humanity"". Excellent illustrations include portraits, many of them done at the time, of the main characters whom he brings vividly to life, as well as clear and helpful maps."

Alfred Prufrock may have measured out his life in coffee spoons, but commuters on London's beleaguered underground railway use a more prosaic system: cancellations, breakdowns and inaudible apologies. For the past five years, they have at least had something to read while sitting in tunnels: Emily Dickinson and John Keats, not to mention Shelley, Auden and MacNeice. In 1986 an expatriate New Yorker named Judith Cherniak persuaded London Underground that its customers needed poetry in their lives. Its trains now carry 5,000 posters displaying bite-sized chunks of it.
Even more surprising, the posters are read and enjoyed. Last September Cassell decided to print an anthology of the underground poets*. At last count, it had sold 17,000 copies, and is now at number 12 on the non-fiction bestseller list. It is, as Cassell notes, ""not bad going for poetry these days."" The scheme has been so popular that London Underground now meets most of the cost itself, and the idea has spread as far afield as Stuttgart and Melbourne.
A certain amount of care needs to be exercised. Although London Underground allows the editors complete freedom, there have been disagreements over some of their choices. The anonymous 16th-century ""Western wind when wilt thou blow/the small rain down can rain/Christ if my love were in my arms/and I in my bed again"" was deemed allowably saucy, but there were fears that a mildly pornographic 15th-century ditty, ""I have a gentil cock"", might prove too inflammatory for clerks rattling their way on the Central Line from Ealing Broadway to Bank.
The editors also spent a cheerless time looking for a work by the present poet laureate, Ted Hughes, that did not have blood in it, while Stevie Smith's suicidal ""Not Waving but Drowning"" was rejected lest it discourage the afflicted. But most complaints have come from users of the Piccadilly Line--on which, because of its terminus at Heathrow Airport, the poetry gets elbowed out by ads for duty-free whisky.

""Dr Schwohrer arrived at the hotel in the early-morning hours of July 2th 1904, to find that his patient, Dr Chekhov, was dying. The doctor ordered up a bottle of champagne...""
When Raymond Carver came upon this bizarre detail from the life of Anton Chekhov in Henri Troyat's biography, he was so intrigued by it that he used it as the starting-point for ""Errand"", a short story that pays homage to the writer he regarded as the greatest master of the genre. The genesis of the story is recounted in this book, a posthumous gathering of Carver's previously uncollected writings.
The virtues that Carver admired in Chekhov were ones he himself sought to practise: that ability to evoke times and places, and to ""bear witness"" to what it was to be human. Carver abhorred the gratuitously experimental, all those exercises in the bizarre and surreal that seemed to make up the writing climate of America in the 1960s. He thought them silly and self-regarding. In his opinion, the fiction that counted was always about people; it had a strong narrative interest and some compelling inner force that so drew the reader on that ""he couldn't turn away his eyes unless the house caught fire"". Short stories, Carver also said, ""should be built to last. They should also be pleasing, if not beautiful, to look at, and everything inside them should 'work'.""
Carver had begun writing his first imitations of Faulkner and Hemingway at college in the early 1960s, but it was not until the mid-1970s, with the publication of ""Will You Please be Quiet, Please?"", that his work was taken up by a big publishing house. Several things hampered his early writing career. He married young, and for many years he threw the best part of his energies into blue-collar labouring jobs to make ends meet: hospital porter, dictionary salesman, petrol-station attendant, general delivery man. For about a decade he was dogged by alcoholism. After the collapse of his marriage in the late 1970s he found a sympathetic companion in Tess Gallagher, a fiction writer, and the years he spent with her--from 1977 until he died of lung cancer in 1988 at the age of 50--were the most creative of his life.
Carver's subject matter can be summed up in the little phrase that Camus once used to describe a certain terrible kind of domesticity: ""dis-ease"". No other writer has described quite so tellingly the condition of the alcoholic, that curiously disturbing state in which time and place seem to float free of each other. The stories are full of human flotsam and jetsam, desperate, ordinary people trying to make sense of their broken lives. The language is always plain, forceful and realistically detailed.
This collection ends with a meditation upon a line from Saint Teresa that Carver became especially fond of before his death: ""Words lead to deeds...They prepare the soul, make it ready, and move it to tenderness."" The first statement is quintessential Carver, a man who always required words to give an honest account of themselves."

Their staple characters, caricatures of self-sacrificing parents and guilt-ridden children, have passed effortlessly into mainstream American comedy through Woody Allen and Jerry Lewis, among many others. Yet Yiddish cinema was much more than that. Its comedies of shtetl life, dramas of double-edged assimilation and free-spirited musicals offer a broad window on to a culture that flourished in Eastern Europe for a few decades only, until it was obliterated in the second world war. Now the collapse of the Soviet Union, combined with growing interest in Germany and America, is bringing vanished films to light and back on to the screen.
Yiddish cinema originated in the early 1900s, when moving pictures with spoken Yiddish translations circulated in the Russian pale of settlement where most European Jews still lived. There never was a Yiddish film industry, but from 1910 to 1940 around 100 films were produced on two continents. Most of them adapted stories familiar to audiences of Yiddish theatre, which operated freely even in Russia after the tsarist ban on it was lifted in 1905. At the same time, emigrants were transplanting that theatre to Manhattan's Second Avenue.
By the 1920s, American and Soviet directors were adapting serious Yiddish literature for the screen. Moscow's new Bolshevik government briefly allowed Yiddish culture to flower (if only to keep liturgical Hebrew from gaining speakers). Films were part of that policy, and the stories adapted for the screen were usually by Sholem Aleichem, a Yiddish writer whose work managed to weather every campaign of censorship from Moscow. The 1925 comedy, ""Jewish Luck"" offers a haunting irony for post-Holocaust audiences--one of many such moments in Yiddish films--when a would-be shadkhn, or marriage-broker, delivers hundreds of hopeful Jewish brides by cattle-car to the port of Odessa.
At the same time, in the United States, enterprising producers were rendering mainstream films faryidysht (Yiddishised) by substituting Yiddish captions in silents or, when sound came, inserting entirely new soundtracks. Even lurid anti-Semitic silents could--and did--emerge from the booth of an ingenious editor as Yiddish-dialogue tributes to Jewish heroism.
Most Yiddish movies were destined exclusively for a Yiddish-speaking audience, albeit an urban and secular one. Some actors had to learn Yiddish simply to perform in them. There was little innovation and no masterpieces, although ""Jewish Luck"" and Edward Ulmer's 1937 romance, ""Green Fields"" (filmed in New Jersey), deserve places in the history of cinema, as do two Yiddish-speaking stage actors-turned-film stars, Maurice Schwartz and Mollie Picon.
The mere quarter-century of Yiddish cinema coincides largely with the period during which millions of East European Jews abandoned the insular Jewish world of the pale of settlement. In a new and exhaustive study, ""Bride of Light"" (The Museum of Modern Art/Schocken Books, $40), J. Hoberman shows how Yiddish films charted that process, and includes reviews of those films from the contemporary Yiddish and non-Yiddish press. Even in their heyday, Yiddish films routinely faced a battering from Jews or bemusement from Gentiles. (""The wife finally kills her husband,"" one non-Jewish reporter observed about ""Di Shkite"" (The Slaughter), ""in a scene where realism riots into burlesque, as it frequently does on the Yiddish stage."")
Mr Hoberman argues that, wedged between tradition and modernity, between parents and children, Yiddish films deal with that conflict as if in an extended family quarrel. In New York in the 1930s, the shame of betraying one's faith and family produced a sub-genre of its own, a profusion of weepy shund (sin) films that hopelessly overdramatised parental misery and filial ingratitude.
How Yiddish films presented the crisis of assimilation depended on where they were made. In New York, where half of all Yiddish films were produced (New Jersey farms turned out to have an uncanny resemblance to Ukrainian shtetls), the 1932 tragi-comedy ""Uncle Moses"" cast Schwartz as a godfatherly businessman from the old country, battling with strikers, greedy in-laws and his own misgiving about benevolence in a Lower East Side sweatshop. Nathan Becker, the young worker who flees New York for a proletarian utopia in a 1932 Soviet propaganda feature, ""The Return of Nathan Becker"", learns that even Stalinist work discipline can accommodate a Yiddish joke or two--on the screen, at least.
After 1945, in spite of efforts to revive Yiddish in Poland and elsewhere, the era of Yiddish cinema was virtually over. As one director and producer, Joseph Green, put it: ""I lost 6m of my best customers."" Meanwhile, the surviving Yiddish-speaking audience was becoming older and narrower, a process that continues today. While the offspring of Yiddish speakers in America were going to college or moving to the suburbs, in the Soviet Union post-war assimilation away from the language took on the pace of a forced march.
By 1975, after decades of post-war neglect, Yiddish cinema had been reduced to a handful of movies (some in flammable nitrate) and piles of remnants scattered everywhere from Detroit to Australia to Brazil. Then the National Centre for Jewish Film at Brandeis University began an international search for footage, followed by a restoration project and a full cataloguing of the films. Two years ago that body sponsored a commercial release of ""The Dybbuk"" (Warsaw, 1937), an Expressionist adaptation of a tale of love and exorcism, which is probably the best-known Yiddish play. Extra prints have since been paid for from the sale of the rights to German television.
Now 28 Yiddish features, including ""The Dybbuk"", are making a world tour (with stops in Berlin, London and Jerusalem), in a programme called ""Yiddish Film: Between Two Worlds."" Rumour has it that more footage, perhaps entire prints, are still buried in archives. ""The Return of Nathan Becker"" emerged from a post-glasnost Soviet Union, as did ""Jews on the Land"", a 1925 documentary about ""productivised"" Jews on a collective farm in the Crimea. A lost dramatic tradition, and a lost culture, are about to be discovered again."

They sailed to Japan, or China, or Australia loaded with something that Britain had and the Japanese wanted, and returned with tea, silk or wool. These merchants did not speak in the way George Bush did in Japan on January 7th-10th: that we buy your cars so you should buy ours. Silk for silk: not a very worthwhile trade. Nor did they speak as Japan and the European Community are doing about farm trade, ahead of a crucial meeting on January 13th in GATT's Uruguay round of trade negotiations: that we cannot buy your rice and wheat because our farmers cannot grow them as cheaply as yours can. Tea too cheap to buy: such talk would have deserved a keelhauling.
Most of all, the men dispatching the clippers knew that trade was too valuable to scupper, even if some of their landlubber governments did their best to do so. Today the landlubbers are gaining control. In the United States, trade with Japan is becoming the whipping-boy in this year's presidential election campaign, rather as Britain was in campaigns in the 1890s, when it too was America's chief creditor and trading partner. In Europe and Japan, politicians may throw away the whole of the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation because they prefer a social policy for the 5% of their populations that work on farms to an economic policy that would benefit all their people. America, ever fond of the make-my-day approach to policy, is daring them to do it.
Why shouldn't it? And why shouldn't Japan be the whipping-boy for America's long recession? After all, Japan is believed to be an unfair trader--the worst of them all, some say. If Japan and the EC would open their markets to America's exports, that would mean more jobs, higher incomes for Americans, and an end to recession. Japan practises what Peter Drucker, a business pundit, called ""adversarial trade""--ie, it does not import the same sorts of goods as it exports.
These, at least, are the views which lie behind American truculence about trade, and which served as justification for President Bush's tough pose in Japan (see page 31). But these notions are aimed at a false problem and offer a solution that will not, in fact, solve anything. Most revealingly of all, they are based on a misconception about trade itself: what is the point of it, and why it should not be scuppered.
The false problem is the view that Japan is an unfair trader. It is not. Its formal and informal barriers to trade are, on average, lower than in other industrial countries (see page 61). What is true, however, is that Japanese businessmen are like businessmen everywhere--protectionist when it suits their interests. When developing a new product or nurturing sales of an old one, Japanese producers will try to get their market protected against competition. Their closeness to the relevant ministries--usually the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or that for telecommunications--means that they sometimes get away with it. That is why there are so many anecdotes about closed markets, ranging from the comical to the outrageous. But anecdotes do not add up to a general truth. More often than not, the producer lobbies do not get their way. When they do, as over Japan's ban on rice imports, it is good for the lobbies, but not for Japan as a whole.
If Japan is so open, why doesn't it import? The answer is that it does, hugely. In 1990 it was the world's third-largest importer, taking in $235 billion-worth of goods. Its imports were thus bigger than the GNP of Sweden, and almost as large as that of India; since 1985 they have risen by 84%. Whereas in 1980 only 23% of those imports were manufactures, by 1990 the proportion had risen to more than half. Measured by imports per head, Japan is pretty similar to America: $1,900 in 1990 against America's $2,050.
Just because Japan imports a lot does not mean it could not, or should not, import more. But the cry to boost imports brings in the false solution. On his trip, Mr Bush chose to match Japan's producer lobbies with a set of his own, led by the heads of GM, Ford and Chrysler. These industrial paragons complained that Japanese do not buy enough of their cars. Japanese car makers obligingly promised to help out, by buying American car parts and displaying American cars in their dealerships. All this does is to create an expectation among Americans that car sales to Japan will rise and that America's trade deficit will fall. Since neither is likely, they will be annoyed, preferably with Mr Bush but probably also with Japan.
REMEMBER RICARDO
The American approach does not deserve to be dignified by the word ""trade"". After all, it is an odd sort of trade in which a firm asks its competitors to sell its goods for it. It is also odd to claim that because Japan does not import large quantities of the same things as it exports, such trade is ""adversarial"", a term generally contrasted to the sort of trade that is ""mutually beneficial"". This is to misunderstand what trade is all about.
The point of trade is to allow an economy to specialise. If a country is better at making ships than sealing-wax, it makes sense to put more resources into ship-building, and to export some of the ships to pay for imports of sealing-wax. This is even true if it is the world's best maker of sealing-wax, for it will still prosper by making ships instead--which, in turn, is why countries can trade successfully even if they are not best at anything. This is what David Ricardo, a British economist in the early 19th century, meant when he coined the term ""comparative advantage"". That phrase is now one of the most misused of economic ideas, since it is often wrongly assumed to mean an advantage compared with other countries (as in ""soon America will not have a comparative advantage in anything""). This matters for more than merely semantic reasons, for Ricardo's insight was a powerful one.
To Ricardo, Japan's adversarial trade would have been entirely explicable. It is good at making cars, so it specialises in that and exports a lot of them; imported cars find it hard to compete, unless they are a different sort of car (like a BMW); Japan uses the export revenue to buy lots of things it is less good at making, such as drugs and aeroplanes. It does not require trade barriers to achieve this result: markets and relative prices do the trick. Where government blocks trade, as with rice, it traps resources in an area in which Japan is inefficient.
Carving up markets between car makers, or any other producers, thwarts that process of specialisation through trade. So does spending billions on protecting West European or Japanese farmers; those billions could bring more European or Japanese prosperity if they were spent elsewhere. So would scuppering the Uruguay round, for the point of agreeing common trade rules is to allow comparative advantage to work its magic. Those who sailed in the clippers would not have recognised the phrase, but they certainly knew what it meant."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224174860/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/2?accountid=14657,"The rocket that brought down a helicopter carrying European Community observers in northern Croatia on January 7th was intended to kill more than the five men on board. Another victim in the gunner's sights was plans to expand the EC operation into a full peacekeeping force, and similar proposals to send United Nations peacekeepers to Yugoslavia. A pause for some mind-clearing would be welcome. But it would be a pity if the whole notion of international peacekeeping were to be shot down. The risk is that any thugs eager to go on thumping their opponents will think that they have only to kill a few men in blue berets to send the peacekeepers home. Since many people have been hoping that 1992 would see an expansion of UN peacekeeping in places as far afield as Afghanistan, Cambodia, El Salvador and the Horn of Africa, and perhaps the emergence of some new kind of UN force to help end civil wars, this reverse would be felt far beyond Yugoslavia.
To avoid such a fate, the first need is to recognise the difference between peacekeeping and peacemaking. In Yugoslavia, despite the ceasefire that had come into force four days earlier, there has been no peace to keep. Umpteen ceasefires have been made and broken, most of them faster than new year's resolutions. This latest ceasefire seemed more promising than its predecessors, but even it had elicited a vow from several Serb commanders that they would battle on regardless. At present, therefore, both the sincerity and the authority of the Serb leaders of Yugoslavia's federal forces are still in doubt.
peace, if there is to be one, will first have to be made before an international force could help to keep it.
Could the UN make such a peace? It has done so in the past only when it--meaning the Security Council--has judged the stakes to be so high that a huge operation was essential: in Korea in 1950 and in the Gulf last year. Nothing like that is in prospect for Yugoslavia, unless the civil war threatens to embroil its Balkan neighbors. Most UN peacekeeping operations have been more modest affairs, although several have turned out to be long-lived (the UN groups in Kashmir and the Middle East have been in place since 1948) and the Congo venture in 1960 was by no means small. It is plain, however, that nothing short of a huge force would be able to impose peace in Yugoslavia unless there were a change of heart among the belligerents. Since such a force is also needed in Cambodia, where there is at last a peace to keep, and smaller forces are needed in half a dozen other countries, the chances of mustering a successful peace-imposing army for Yugoslavia are slight.
When Yugoslavia is ready for a peacekeeping force, as it may soon be, it will be able to draw on lessons painfully learnt elsewhere. One is that peacekeepers must expect to be shot at. The (non-UN) multinational force that was withdrawn from Beirut in 1983 failed primarily because its American continent was judged to be pro-Israeli and its French continent to be pro-Maronite: manifest impartiality is essential for peacekeepers. But it is open to question whether the United States would have had the will to go on losing men after more than 250 of its marines had been killed in a single bombing. Peacekeeping is never risk-free, as some countries (India, Ireland and Malaysia) that regularly lend their soldiers to the UN well know. More than 800 men have died in UN operations.
A TRIPWIRE FOR SPOILERS
Outsiders, using diplomatic pressure, sanctions and other rewards and punishments, can put pressure on civil warriors to make peace. Only then, when the main parties to the dispute have stopped shooting, are outsiders wise to commit troops. Having done so, they must be ready to take casualties; otherwise spoilers will always better them. This is what happened in Cyprus in 1974 and South Lebanon in 1982, when the spoilers were not small fry but one of the main parties to the dispute.
In such circumstances the UN has had no automatic mandate to act. It has had to limp off. In future, when it ventures into peacekeeping, the Security Council might consider attaching a tripwire clause to the relevant resolution, which would say, ""Disregard this peacekeeping force or flout its authority and you will automatically bring down upon yourself some pre-planned collective action."" The collective action could perhaps come from a new kind of UN force-soldiers set aside by members specially for such an eventuality.
By putting the United Nations under an obligation to act, that might make some people uneasy. It might stretch some armies. But it would be a deterrent to spoilers large or small. Without some such change, those who shoot down helicopters carrying peacekeepers will have nothing to lose."

His crime? To have worked as a government official for the communists. He could be banned from a wide range of public jobs for five years. In Budapest the 76-year-old Bela M, who helped put down Hungary's uprising in 1956, all of a sudden risks trial for treason. Riffling through police records opened to the public this month, Clara N in Berlin discovered with a shock that her husband had been two-timing her: while she was out campaigning against the East German government, he was out spying on her for the secret police.
The parliaments of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland have passed or are considering bills to penalise former communists. In Germany thousands of ex-officials from the east have lost their jobs; trials (mainly of small fry such as border guards) are under way; and almost everybody is asking who, if anyone, was not a police informer. In the countries of what was the Soviet Union, the mood of revenge has not yet hardened into law. It soon may. The exception is Romania, where many holdovers from the old regime are still in place.
The defeat of communism in Eastern Europe raised awkward questions. Exactly who, in the bad days, did behave well? Who was a real dissident and who a resistant de la derniere heure, as Frenchmen were called who joined the fight against the Germans in 1944 once they were safely on their way home? The region has never known much democracy. Its success in building it will depend a lot on how the victors (the democrats) now treat the losers (the communists). Morals and law here seem to point in different directions. To forgive the old regime, say the moralists, rewards the wrongdoers and harms their victims a second time. But how, query the lawyers, can the state write fair and usable definitions of whom to prosecute? What jury is unbiased or untainted? Does one-half of society (or is it one-quarter, one-eighth?) stand in judgment on the rest?
Eastern Europe is not the first to face this sort of dilemma. At the close of America's civil war, Abraham Lincoln summed up the task facing the country: ""With malice towards none, with charity towards all...to bind up the nation's wounds."" No historical likeness is exact, and after Lincoln's death Congress took a more vengeful road. But there are modern examples of once bitterly divided countries that prospered by following Lincoln's advice. The most striking is Spain after the death of General Franco, its dictator from 1939 to 1975. Rather than settle 40-year-old scores, left and right in Spain agreed to build democracy. Re-fighting civil wars condemns countries to live in the past--and the penchant of East Europeans for dwelling there needs no encouragement.
Justice also argues for tolerance. Democracy entails not simply multi-party elections but a system of law that protects the rights of all citizens, however base or scurvy. This implies certain rules: people ought not to be tried for things that were not considered crimes when they did them; the time-limit for prosecuting a crime should not be extended after the event to suit special circumstances; guilt has to be proven case by case; people should not be punished merely for belonging to a group (unless, of course, membership is explicitly a crime). Much anti-communist legislation recently passed or under study in Eastern Europe flouts one or more of these basic principles.
REVEALING THE PAST WILL HELP BURY IT
The human damage and suffering require, all the same, a moral reckoning. Since the trial of German and Japanese leaders after the second world war, most people agree that, whatever local laws say, heinous crimes ""against humanity"" ought (ideally) to be prosecuted. Stalin's grim work falls into this category. A few very old Russians may yet stand trial. But lumping the tormentors of Eastern Europe into this class is wrong. Most were bullies who robbed people of liberty and jobs. They never approached the barbarism of Stalin or Tojo, let alone Hitler.
Political crime is beset by double standards. What to do with the world's ex-oppressors (and sponsors of terrorism) might be simpler if there were a world criminal court with judges from many countries. Communists would not be the only people in the dock. In the meantime, East Europeans ought to take the law as it is. What prosecutions there are should start at the top. It is wrong, for example, for German border guards to face trial, even if the penalty is a short suspended sentence, while their bosses--ultimately Erich Honecker, a fugitive seeking asylum--go free. And might not communists who have kept privileges (whence the resentment behind much anti-communist legislation) simply be made to give them up?
Eastern Europe's heroes--people such as Lech Walesa, Bronislaw Geremek and Vaclav Havel--are asking for tolerance. Law is not the only way to expiate the past. There is the press, theatre, television. There are school-teachers and, above all, historians. Exposing the truth about wrongdoing, under communism and before, is the best insurance against its happening again. Communist leaders were once convinced history was on their side. Even if not behind bars, defeat for them in the court of history is crushing punishment of its own."

The wrong-doing could prove the need for stricter measures, or its detection could show that the existing system works. Unflashy, long-running abuses provide a better test of regulation. A case in point is ""soft commissions"" in the stockmarket. Under a soft deal, a stockbroker agrees to pay the bill for something that a fund manager chooses--Reuters screens are popular in Britain--by setting aside a fixed proportion of the broking commission he receives on each trade. If a manager stops trading through that broker, his Reuters screen gets taken away (see page 67). Almost everyone admits that soft commissions may hurt the savings of ordinary people, and nobody claims that they help those savings grow. Yet regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have chosen to permit soft commissions. They are putting the industry's interests before the public good, which is exactly the opposite of what they should be doing.
IMPOTENT EMPTOR
The obvious danger in soft commissions is that they twist a money manager's judgment. He is hired to look after people's savings (mostly in pension funds), and must ensure that the brokers who buy and sell stocks for his clients get the best possible price. Soft commissions may make it harder for him to switch brokers if he suspects he is not getting that price.
""Softing"" may also distort a manager's choice of how much to trade. It encourages him to shuffle his client's shares: each purchase or sale generates a commission, and therefore money towards that Reuters screen. Moreover, some brokers are willing to offer soft refunds only on very large orders, further influencing a manager's trading habits. Managers are paid to serve the best interests of the pension fund or other client; soft commissions put them in temptation's way.
Most investment managers preserve their virtue, no doubt. They ensure that their brokers get good prices; they trade only when they see profitable opportunities for their clients. Yet it is hard to believe that every investment manager is so scrupulous, or that all savings are safe from abuse. After all, similar temptations prove seductive in other walks of life. Doctors, paid to prescribe the best drugs for their patients, mysteriously change both the quantity and type of pill they recommend when drug companies entertain them at conferences in the Seychelles.
As for pension-plan members, they get no benefit to offset the risks in soft commissions. A fund manager does not save them money by paying for a trading screen in soft dollars; since brokers' commissions are negotiable, the manager could push commissions down by the amount of the soft refund, and use the money to foot the Reuters bill himself. Though the fund manager pays the broker's commission, he does so out of his clients' money. Being only human, he spends other people's money less carefully than he does his own.
That is exactly why soft commissions are booming. Money managers naturally favour an arrangement which pays some of their office expenses out of other people's savings. Further down the line, other professionals--who provide research and advice to pension managers and trustees--are similarly delighted, because soft dollars pay their fees. Soft commissions mean easy money for financiers; they may also mean slimmer pensions for their clients.
A market solution is possible, but elusive. A few money managers could announce that they will have nothing to do with soft commissions, then use their proclaimed virtue as a way to attract new business. In recent years, however, soft commissions have spread. Regulators have insisted on full disclosure of soft deals, in the hope that pension-fund trustees will check that softing does not lead their managers astray. Unfortunately, no amount of disclosure can tell trustees whether brokers are securing ""best possible execution"", a concept which is anyway hard to define. Nor can trustees judge whether funds are being shuffled needlessly. Trustees will always lack the information to curtail abuses.
Soft commissions carry risks for savers but no benefits, and there is no obvious way for the savers to police the risks: that is why they should be banned."

Now rail competition beckons again. On today's railways it can be engineered by allowing rival companies to bid for the right to run services, and it may even be possible to allow some simultaneous competition on the same tracks. Several countries are now experimenting with these ideas. Britain itself should be one of them, now that the government is about to publish its plans for privatising British Rail. Alas, ministers are in danger of pushing instead for a quick and limited sale. If they are to exploit the potential for future competition, they will need to do better than that.
The transport secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, wants to sell the Inter-City express service (complete with track) as a single, self-contained business. This would do competition no favours. The Treasury would get a good price only if the buyer had generous protection against rivals wanting to use Inter-City's own tracks. Selling the company whole would also make it harder to privatise BR's network by route-region in the future, because the best routes would have been sold already. John Major is thought to be sympathetic to regional privatisation, and with good reason. It would be far simpler to introduce; it would evoke commercially useful parallels with Britain's pre-1948 private network; and it could draw lessons from Japan's regionally divided railways, which are now highly profitable and about to be sold. Mr Rifkind objects to a regional division, because every region is now subsidised. But one day the services could be franchised and subsidies confined to the costs of maintaining the track.
The Inter-City plan looks ill-judged even on political grounds. Long-suffering commuters in the south-east would gain little, and the first effect of the sale would almost certainly be a pruning of Inter-City's present network, cutting out stops at many smaller cities. Nor would local passengers necessarily appreciate having to pay higher fares as the result of a private Inter-City increasing its charges to other users of its lines.
The required division of railway assets would be hard to implement and even harder to regulate. How would you split Paddington station's assets and services between Inter-City and regional commuter services? How would you advise a signalman who had to decide whether to give priority to an Inter-City express or a commuter train? On some estimates, a contract between Inter-City and the rest of BR would have to resolve more than 30,000 such dilemmas.
A GREEN FLAG FOR TRIAL RUNS
Other bits of Mr Rifkind's reported proposals make more sense. The government appears ready to sell off BR's freight services to several owners; large customers, like British Coal, might take the opportunity to run their own freight trains. And since BR's freight division owns little of the track it uses, its sale would not preclude additional competition from new operators. Change is badly needed on freight, where BR has begun losing some core customers, like parts of the Royal Mail.
Mr Rifkind is also prepared to hold an auction for operating franchises on selected passenger routes, which would be offered complete with subsidy. In Sweden such auctions have resulted in operating costs being cut by as much as a third. But Mr Rifkind's franchise plans appear to involve only loss-making regional lines. He should be bolder. In a first phase--and with the experience of the television-franchise auction to draw on--he could offer five-year franchises not just on local routes in the regions, but on major commuter and express lines too. Why not franchise, say, the Waterloo-Exeter route for a newcomer to compete with BR's Paddington-Exeter line? If this worked, complete regions could be franchised later.
In every case, the tracks would have to stay in public ownership, perhaps controlled by a new track authority, because the new railway-service companies would have no interest in long-term investment. Initial franchises would have to be carefully chosen and would, by their very nature, be experimental. There should also be experiments with simultaneous ""on-line"" competition. But none of these should be irreversible. Competitive railways are a new adventure; the best ways forward are bound to be found through practical experience. George Stephenson and his rivals had no grand blueprints for their first steam trains. They just had a genius for adapting to what worked best. Mr Rifkind should give himself room to follow their example."

Professional zoologists liked them too. Now people have the money for exotic holidays, or at least television sets; zoology concentrates on the ways that animals manage their lives in the wild; and animals have rights, or at least an increasing number are thought of as if they do. As a result, some zoos have been slipping towards extinction. For the sake of near-extinct species, the slippage should stop.
Zoos are not redundant. People still like them, though not as much as they used to. A good city zoo can attract as many visitors each year as there are people in the city--though some, like London's, do not. Animal-rights campaigners argue that zoos are immoral, that it is wrong to cage creatures which should be free. It is not clear that the animals would always agree; lots of food, no predators, and vets on call make up quite a package. Some zoos do not provide animals with quite such Elysian fields, and their neglect or outright cruelty has tarnished the image of all zoos. Redress, though, is straightforward. Unless misguidedly supported by other means, unpopular zoos will die.
SORRY, SHELLS AND SLUGS
Zoos are well placed to do something that people want done--conserving animals. It is hard work, but it does not make them unattractive drudges. Zoos like those at San Diego and Cincinnati in America, and Chester in Britain, which are good at conservation and good at being seen doing it, are thriving.
There is a snag: preservation on the basis of popularity can turn into speciesism, which some regard as the most wicked ism of all. People who will happily shell out to see pandas may not do the same to see, well, shells. But aesthetics may be no worse a criterion than any other for deciding which animals are deserving of charity. After all, beauty often leads on to extinction--ask any species with pretty feathers, or pelts, or tusks. Why not allow it to lead to preservation as well?
Discrimination in favour of the big and attractive has other things to recommend it. Most extinct species died out because the place they lived in was destroyed. For the small and unspectacular species--the majority of extinctions--this process is precipitous. Once the trees start falling around them, their fate is sealed. To preserve such species, the answer is to protect their habitat. Big animals, on the other hand, are killed off in slower and less impersonal ways, hunted for food or sport or because they are competing with livestock. For them, captive breeding in zoos may be their last chance to survive.
Modern ecological theory reckons that, to survive in the wild, a species cannot afford to drop below 2,000 or 3,000 individuals; otherwise inbreeding, disease or bad weather can easily wipe it out. Mollycoddled in zoos, and with matings carefully arranged to keep their genes fresh and diverse, rare species can be nursed through crises in much smaller numbers. And there is no better way to pay for such care than to charge people to come and see it going on--and in doing so, become more refined in their view of animals. Documentaries can be beautiful. For a proper appreciation of nature, though, there is nothing quite like the smell of elephant dung."

Both depended for their sales mainly on the American market for medical services. Glaxo's product was less than a novelty: an anti-ulcer drug, Zantac, modelled on a rival product. EMI's scanner was the biggest advance in radiography since the discovery of x-rays. Glaxo became one of Europe's outstandingly successful companies. EMI, crippled by losses on its scanner business, was sold at a knock-down price.
This contrast (no novelty, it is developed from one drawn by John Kay, of the London Business School) illustrates one key point about technological advance: innovation does not automatically lead to competitive advantage. The same point might be made about countries. Britain's scientists rank high (see chart). (chart omitted) Yet by any measure of world competitiveness, Britain does poorly. The Concorde supersonic airliner was partly designed and built in Britain, but most of the world's intercontinental jets, profitable for builder and operator alike, are Boeings.
Governments, knowing that technological innovation can improve growth (and/or national security or, nowadays, if this is the aim, the environment), try to encourage it. Yet they understand little about how innovation takes place or, more important, why some companies and countries are better than others at turning it to their advantage.
HOW TECHNOLOGIES SPREAD
Innovation, whether of a product or a process, is not a simple, uniform affair. It differs from one industry to another, and may often take place within a company in ways hard for outsiders to spot. A broad distinction can be drawn between an innovation and its application. But a constant problem with measuring innovation and tracking its progress through the economy is the difficulty of telling the two apart.
For innovation is rarely something that happens in one place, at one time, in the way that a patent records. The company that comes up with an innovation may not be the one that earns the most profit from it, or even uses it. Sometimes--often, in the development of capital goods--a company that innovates does so for a specific customer, who then enjoys most of the benefits.
The variations are evident in a study of British innovation by Paul Geroski, using data collected by the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, that he reports in the latest Economic Journal. It covered 3,308 commercially significant innovations produced, and a further 3,418 used, in sundry British industries between 1945 and 1983. In the drugs industry these were used mainly by the companies that devised them. But in engineering Mr Geroski tracked a symbiotic link between small, innovative companies and their larger customers, often in different parts of the economy. The bar-code readers used at supermarket check-outs were developed by engineering companies, but with clear specifications, and much research help, from the supermarket operators. Two-thirds of the innovations originated in two industries: engineering (especially electronics) and, to a less extent, chemicals. Their largest user was the textile industry. About a quarter of all uses were in non-manufacturing.
Engineering is dominated by small firms, so it is unsurprising that they appear to dominate innovation. But that does not prove that bigger means dumber. Often the link may be that developed by Japan's motor companies, which typically are not vertically integrated, but rely on thousands of small subcontractors. The large companies organise research teams to help to develop innovations through these suppliers. The two-way process both helps the big car maker to respond fast to market signals and raises skills among its small suppliers. This sort of outsourcing by Japanese manufacturers has become a potent mechanism of technology transfer to developing countries in the region.
BETTER NEXT TIME
Innovation is rarely instantaneous. Technologies develop as they diffuse, improving in reliability, quality and flexibility. Much innovation is a matter of small refinements over a long period, turning an unreliable novelty into a device of economic significance with an evolving range of applications. The steam engine, invented in the 18th century to pump out flooded mines, was gradually applied to other stationary uses such as milling. From 1820 to 1870 its main new application was in transport. Later it was used to generate electricity, a more flexible source of power, which in time displaced many direct uses of steam. It took more than a century for all these applications of the steam engine to be developed.
Most innovations start, like steam power, as solutions to narrow, particular problems. Only gradually are other uses discovered. Nathan Rosenberg, of Stanford University, points out that Thomas Watson, president of IBM, believed that a single computer (the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator, built by the company in 1947) could solve all the big scientific problems in the world, but had no commercial possibilities. Frequently technologies developed for one use find their main potential elsewhere. Gas-turbines, developed for aircraft, are now revolutionising the economics of electricity generation. The laser, invented 30 years ago, appeared at first to have a narrow range of military and scientific uses. Now, much altered, it is an essential component in technologies as diverse as compact-disc players, optical communications and medical surgery.
As a successful technology evolves, more and more companies (or individuals) acquire it. But not all who could use it do so at once. Diffusion follows an S-shaped path through the economy: the innovation is taken up slowly at first, then by a rapidly increasing number of companies, finally by a few laggards. Because innovation is often embodied in new investment, technological advance will happen most quickly in industries that are expanding fastest. Within these industries, the early buyers, predictably, will be those who (not always rightly) see the most profit in the new product or process. They also tend to be large companies, able to afford the financial risks of being a pioneer. Near the end of the S-curve come some companies whose plant, while obsolete, is still efficient enough to cover variable costs. Though the technology is by then proven, such firms still hang on before installing it until its cost has fallen enough to make new investment worthwhile.
Paul Stoneman, of Warwick University, has studied the rate at which computer-numerically-controlled machine tools have been adopted by companies. Large firms in growing industries began to use them in 1968; some small firms in declining industries have not introduced them yet. Apart from a firm's size and financial position, and the efficiency with which information about a new technology is made available, he found that expectations that the cost of new technology would fall had a notable effect on the rate at which it spread. Just as most individuals wait for the price of compact-disc players to fall before they buy, so rational companies wait for lower prices on new generations of machine tools.
A RISKY BUSINESS
The corollary of the S-shaped curve of adoption of new technologies is a similar pattern of profitability for innovators. Pioneers often go bust before they make it to that enticing middle section of the curve where diffusion is increasing rapidly as users rush to buy their better mousetrap. Like EMI with its scanner, the innovator carries most of the risk, but fails to profit from it. The history of innovation is littered with examples of pioneers who devised a technology only to see it exploited by the ""fast second"". One such was Sir Clive Sinclair, British pioneer of the digital watch and the home computer. An American firm, Ampex, invented video-recording, but Japanese ones have made the most money out of it. One reason, occasionally, is that the qualities that make a good innovator may also make a bad manager (hence the cynical rule of venture capitalists--""shoot the inventor""). A bigger reason is that catching up generally takes less time than invention and is cheaper too.
Innovation is costly and risky. In the early 1960s Kenneth Arrow, an American economist, pointed out that if imitators could make an innovation much more cheaply than its inventor there would be little incentive to innovate. In fact, often they can. Edwin Mansfield, of the University of Pennsylvania, has tracked technological advance through the American economy for more than 30 years. He has found that, on average, imitators can make a new product for two-thirds of the cost and time that it took the innovating firm.
Even so, companies go on innovating. Why? One reason is that those that develop a culture of innovation can use it to keep ahead. By the time their imitators have caught up, the thing they have caught up with may no longer be the best, because the innovator has moved on again. Innovation in most industries--and firms--is a continual process, not an event. Honda and BMW, for instance, have used continual innovation to compete against larger car makers.
Occasionally, the imitator has no cost advantage. Mr Mansfield found that one-seventh of the new products he studied cost the imitator as much to create as the innovator. The reason, he suggested, was the superior know-how of the innovating firm, whose specialised experience and better technical information held down its costs.
Sometimes a reputation for innovation, and skilful marketing, allow a company to go on doing well from an easily imitable product, as Sony has with its Walkman, and Marks & Spencer with its chilled foods.
The innovator's traditional protection is through patents. That is not always possible: some products, and nearly all services--as Mr Kay puts it, ""from calculus to junk bonds to flavoured yoghourt""--are not patentable. Even when they are, patents are not a sure-fire defence. Imitators may come up with their own versions of an innovation. Mr Mansfield found that, within four years, 60% of patented and successful innovations were imitated by other companies. Patent protection can raise the costs, and delay the process, of imitation for competitors, who may have to ""reverse-engineer"" a product, but not prevent it entirely. Patents protected Glaxo's Zantac; they did not prevent General Electric developing its own scanner, which swept EMI out of the business.
A conundrum for government industrial policy is how, and how far, to protect innovators from imitation. Many American studies have shown that the gains to a company that innovates are generally modest compared with the gains to society as a whole. From society's point of view, the faster others adapt and develop their own versions of a new technology the better. But there is a trade-off. The less the innovator profits, the less the incentive to innovate.
APPLICATION IS WHAT COUNTS
While innovation is important, application matters as much or more. The first requirement, of course, is awareness of the market and its opportunities. The big money in video came when rivals put Ampex's tape into cassettes--and then it was not the pioneers, Philips and Sony, but a third comer, JVC, whose cassette format swept the world.
That said, generally--IBM is a striking exception--companies with strong research departments do well in application too; perhaps because they find it easier to keep track of new developments taking place outside the company. Within a company, application of new ideas is easier if managers and workforce are young and well-educated, able to make the best use of a new technology and to spot the small improvements that can make it more useful still.
A free flow of ideas within the firm is obviously helpful, and ideas in turn can be helped on their way. In some Japanese companies production-line workers change jobs every three to five months, managers every three to five years. That breaks down the rule of the expert: notoriously, experts in the use of one technology find it hard to see the potential in another that may eventually displace it (and them). Japanese companies also seem to be good at finding ways for people in relatively remote parts of the organisation to contribute to innovation and its application.
WHY COUNTRIES DIFFER
Economists are taking an increasing interest in the way innovation occurs and in its impact on companies. Differences among countries are harder to observe and to quantify. It is difficult even to compare the pace of successful innovation among countries, let alone to explain it. Practice in the granting of patents, the best (though inadequate) guide to the scale of innovation, varies. In Germany only one patent application in three is accepted, in Britain four out of five, in France nine out of ten.
Yet unless countries understand why some have benefited more than others from innovation, they can do little to improve their performance. Even if they do understand, change may still be difficult.
One of the boldest attempts to develop a theory that explains why the pace of innovation differs among countries is a paper written five years ago by Henry Ergas, of the OECD. He found three sets of factors: * Those that affected the inputs into innovation, such as the quality of a country's scientific base, the presence of research institutions and, above all, its education. * Those that influenced demand, such as receptive and sophisticated customers calling for constant innovation. * An industrial structure that combined opportunities for intense competition with some mechanism for firms to share the financing and diffusion of scientific research.
The different ways in which these factors were combined in different countries, he argued, went a long way to explain success or failure in innovation. The role of government in shaping that combination might take one of two basic forms.
In Britain, America and France, technology policy was ""mission-oriented"", or top-down, setting clear goals of national importance--which often meant national defence--and concentrating government R&D money on a small number of large firms. In all three countries, as the chart shows, government support for research is highly concentrated on defence, rather than on general scientific research.
The approach in Germany, Switzerland and Sweden, by contrast, was ""diffusion-oriented"", or bottom-up, responding more flexibly to signals from the market. Here the main goal of technology policy was to encourage innovation through the provision of a different kind of state aid: education, training and the setting of industrial standards, which help to raise quality and to spread new technologies. There was an emphasis on education, especially technical education and the training of engineers; and a high degree of specialisation in the chemical and electrical industries and in mechanical engineering.
Japan's policy was a mixture of the two main approaches. While Japanese companies were catching up with their rivals in other industrial countries, they frequently hit technical problems that they could not afford to solve individually. So the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted as facilitator, organising research and financing corporate participation with loans that had to be paid back if the research succeeded. The effect was to spread the risk of innovation, and also to ensure, in an economy where people rarely moved between firms, that ideas flowed from one company to another. As Japan has caught up technologically with the rest of the world, and Japanese companies have grown wealthier, they have needed MITI's help less. The main agenda for research is now set by companies themselves.
The role of government has altered also in the United States and Britain. America has found that a rising share of the commercial benefits of its defence programme has been accruing to foreign firms. In Britain, those parts of the state whose buying once shaped commercial technologies are now largely in private hands. In both countries, innovation will in future depend more on the private sector than it used to.
For a country to raise its rate of successful innovation may be extremely difficult. As Mr Ergas puts it, ""you can't become like the Germans quickly"". Countries may enjoy a moment in the early years of their development when, as Japan did, they can deliberately pick the best from mature industrial cultures. For a mature culture to change itself is much harder.
The starting point is clearly education. The lack of it is a bigger reason why many poor countries are failing to catch up than is inadequate investment in physical capacity. But education needs to be diffused. A country with a scientific elite but an ill-educated workforce may be an innovator, but it will find it hard to ensure that new ideas are effectively used at home. And investment in human capital, once inadequate, is hard to bring up to scratch. Not only is it a slow process to educate under-educated adults; reeducating a workforce is labour-intensive, and draws heavily on a country's total reserve of well-trained people.
The ability of a workforce to make the best of new technologies may be a country's best competitive advantage. Wealth in raw materials, the foundation of innovation two centuries ago, barely matters: anyone can buy them. Proximity to rich markets matters less as transport costs fall, relative to the value of goods. A demanding local market is a help, but can be replaced by still more demanding foreign ones. Technologies pass rapidly from one company to another. Only that intangible, vital quality, the environment of active brains and productive skills in which companies operate, is non-transferable. To change it, governments need to start at the school gates."

Sense suggests you go skiing; cruel reality is instead making Democrats and Republicans propose plans of mind-numbing complexity, with each group terrified that whatever it does (or doesn't) will confer a political advantage on the other.
The puzzle will be clearer on January 28th, when George Bush is to deliver his ""state of the union"" address to Congress. That speech will review both America's position in the world and the state of the economy. The two are linked, and the chain between them is the defence budget.
Last year the administration proposed defence budgets to 1997 which would have had the effect of reducing budget authority (the amount that the law allows to be spent) by 22% between 1990 and 1997. After the failed August coup in Moscow, the Pentagon recognised that this was unlikely to satisfy those in Congress who wanted to see a peace dividend, and soon. So they determined to make sure, as one Pentagon official puts it, that every dollar in their budget could be defended.
Last year defence-budget authority in fiscal year 1993 (for which the administration's budget is now being finalised) was expected to be $291 billion. In the light of a reduced threat to America's security, Mr Cheney is now expected to propose additional cuts of $5 billion-10 billion in 1993, or perhaps $50 billion over the next four to five years. If these are to be cuts in outlays (the actual money spent), the cuts in budget authority will have to be significantly bigger, since the overhang of old programmes means that simply reducing budget authority does not yield a quick reduction in spending. The Defence Budget Project, a think-tank, reckons that planners need to find cuts of about $14 billion in budget authority for each $5 billion cut in outlays.
This suggests that the number of military employees, which last year the Pentagon projected would drop by a quarter between 1990 and 1995, will shrink further. (Bet on it shrinking faster for privates than for generals.) They also suggest that some cherished programmes may be abandoned: top candidates for the chop include the B-2 stealth bomber and the Seawolf attack submarine.
SPEND, SPEND, SPEND
Now put all this in the context of the budget deficit. For most of the past decade the size of the federal budget deficit has been a constant headache for Washington. A large part of the deficit was caused by the Carter-Reagan defence build-up of 1979-86. So the naive might expect that there would be great rejoicing at the coming defence cuts, which would be applied automatically to deficit reduction. Too simple by half.
In the first place, it is an election year, and both Democrats and Republicans are out to buy votes; cuts in defence give them (they think) the cash to do so. In the second place, the economy's recovery is anaemic. That leads some to argue that fiscal policy needs to be looser than it now is.
Those looking for a fiscal stimulus do not suggest that defence spending should be kept higher than the state of the world requires. But they do suggest that some of the defence savings should be spent on ""expanding our country's capacity to produce and compete in the future"". That is the formula proposed by two senior Democratic senators, Jim Sasser, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Paul Sarbanes, the chairman of the congressional Joint Economic Committee. The senators also suggest that--temporarily, mind--the deficit should be increased by a package of grants and loans to state and local governments and tax cuts aimed at middle-income families.
At first sight, this is mindboggling. Last August the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the deficit in fiscal 1992 would be $362 billion--easily the biggest ever--failing to $278 billion in 1993. In such circumstances, a fiscal stimulus seems like offering an alcoholic a stiff drink. Yet the senators claim to be virtuous. The deficit has ballooned in the past year largely because of the recession, as tax revenues have been lower than expected and expenditure on health and income-support programmes higher. Smoothing out these business-cycle effects, and excluding the extraordinary costs associated with the Gulf war and the bail-out of bankrupt thrifts, the CBO last November estimated a ""structural"" deficit of $188 billion in 1992, falling to $179 billion in 1993. Those figures represent 3.2% and 2.8%, respectively, of GNP; that is not out of line with deficits in other industrial countries.
In large measure, the administration agrees with those who say the fiscal policy is quite tight. If that were not the case, the president would be arguing that the savings in defence should go straight to reducing the deficit. Instead, it seems plain that he will propose that the defence savings should be spent on a series of tax breaks: a tax credit for health-insurance premiums, or one for first-time home buyers. And all this is in addition to the certainty that the ""state of the union"" address will call for a cut in the capital-gains tax and for an investment tax-credit.
Such a package of propsals from Mr Bush would confirm that he is willing to change one part of the budget agreement of 1990. Under that agreement, reductions in one category of spending (say defence) cannot be used to increase spending in another (say health). Mr Bush is not alone in wanting to demolish the walls between spending categories; Mr Sasser does, and so does Tom Foley, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives. The defenders of the budget agreement, and there are few left among the politicians, argue that it has imposed a discipline of sorts on Washington; less than 1% of the CBO's forecast increase in the deficits in the five years to 1997 is accounted for by policy changes.
A second risk is that any proposal by the administration of its own preferred tax breaks will inevitably invite Democrats to write their own, and that each party would agree in a devil's pact to allow the other's favourite wheeezes to become law. Much depends on the position taken by Dan Rostenkowski, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means committee. Mr Rostenkowski thinks that his first obligation to the economy is to do it no harm; and he has made little secret of his belief that any tax bill in an election year could easily be harmful. When his committee held hearings on tax policy before Christmas, several economists testified that tax cuts would do little to stimulate the economy quickly enough to end the recession faster than might otherwise be the case.
Of course, the opposite--an unwitting angels' pact--might come about. If a tax bill is considered this year, the Republicans might demand cuts in the rate of tax on capital gains so deep that Democrats cannot accept them, and Democrats might demand higher taxes on the rich that Republicans can tolerate. The result would be bad-tempered deadlock; which, if the economy started to pick up of its own accord in the spring (and so the deficit started to fall once more), would be no bad thing."

He needs to. Connecticut faces fiscal pressure that the biggest tax increase in the state's history, including the introduction of a bitterly contested income tax, has failed to ease. The tax rise was intended to reduce a looming $2.6 billion deficit in the state's $8 billion budget, and to leave a modest surplus that would be the start of a five-year drive to restore fiscal stability.
Yet the state's comptroller, William Curry, now says that, far from balancing its budget, Connecticut faces a deficit of $179m for its financial year to June. That is bigger than even the projected deficit that Mr Weicker used last month to scare off attempts to repeal his unpopular income tax. Mr Curry also says that Connecticut's financial state is more parlous than that forecast suggests. Using the same accounting rules as business does, the projected deficit would be nearer $555m.
High taxes and fiscal traumas used to be things that affected neighbouring New Yorkers, not the affluent citizens of Connecticut. As recently as four years ago, the state had a fat surplus. Sales taxes, taxes on unearned income and corporate profits skimmed ample cream off a booming state economy that made Connecticut's residents the richest in America.
As in other New England states, the slow erosion of Connecticut's main industries has been turned into a rockslide by the national recession. In Connecticut's case, a heavy dependence on defence contracting (aero engines, submarines) and insurance has proved especially damaging. Since 1989 the state has lost more than 100,000 jobs; its population is only 3.3m.
A tax base that depends on workers spending, companies making profits and homeowners making capital gains stops growing when consumption slows, profit evaporates and property markets slump. Mr Weicker's income tax was intended to provide a new and less volatile source of tax revenue, as well as one that was less tilted against business. Partly because of the tax credits conceded to get it passed by the legislature, which four times failed to override the governor's veto of budgets that did not include an income tax, the new tax is likely to yield $100m less than expected. The continuing sluggishness of the economy accounts for much of the rest of the shortfall.
But there is deeper trouble. In September Connecticut became one of only eight states (six of them in New England) to be downgraded by Standard & Poor's, a credit-rating agency. S&P was worried about the state's growing debt taken on to finance its deficits. This had risen from $7.3 billion outstanding in 1986 to around $11 billion. S&P noted then that the state had not left itself much of a cushion if economic recovery did not materialise. Like Massachusetts before it, Connecticut is finding that large yearly increases in spending merely feed the appetite for more of the same.
Pundits point to the impossibility of a further tax increase in an election year and the likelihood of a renewed attempt to repeal the income tax. In which case, Connecticut has little option but to take the axe to spending if it wants to balance its budget, as is required by the state constitution. Spending cuts will have to go beyond accounting tricks such as stretching out loan repayments and deferring contributions to the state teachers' pension fund.
They will also have to go far beyond the tiddly $21m in new spending ""cuts"" that Mr Curry reckons will now be wrung out of the budget this year--meaning mostly cuts in projected increases. Mr Weicker has proposed chopping aid to local governments, prescription-drug subsidies for the elderly and the budgets for education, the courts and county sheriffs. That will have to be just the start. If last year was the most politically vitriolic many in Connecticut could remember, 1992 promises to be even nastier."

Alongside articles detailing where Madonna works out and recommending ""apres-shop spas"" are familiar advertisements offering a quicker route to beauty through ""facial sculpture"", liposuction and breast enhancement. Cosmetic operations, once closely kept secrets, now appear as prizes in southern Californian charity raffles. Meanwhile morticians complain that silicone implants, which do not burn, are clogging up their crematoriums.
Los Angeles, a desert city which made up for its lack of natural endowments by stealing other people's water and building its own port, is an appropriate capital for America's $3 billion cosmetic-surgery industry. Nearly half the world's cosmetic surgeons live in America; a third of those work in California. Cosmetic surgery arguably began in San Francisco in 1964 when a topless dancer, Carol Doda, caused a national sensation by increasing her appeal with the help of 20 silicone injections.
Until recently the most remarkable thing about cosmetic surgery in America, was how unremarkable it was. There were probably 2m cosmetic ""procedures"" in 1991--six times the total in 1981. It is no longer news that stars such as Michael Jackson, Liz Taylor and Cher have ""gone under the knife""; one talk-show hostess, Joan Rivers, talks about her body's ebbs and flows as if they were as natural as the tides. Only the most intimate cosmetic operations--such as a penile implant--merit secrecy.
Now those ""effortless"" good looks seem a little more risky. Allegedly, the silicone implants can leak and interfere with the body's immune system. There have been over 2,000 complaints, particular about implants which predate 1985--although cosmetic surgeons blame zealous lawyers for manufacturing concerns. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced an inquiry last year, but initially said it would not ask for the operations to stop before it reported. It changed its mind on January 6th, reportedly because of evidence coming out in court cases. In December, for example, a woman who suffered from a ruptured implant was awarded $7.34m from the biggest maker of implants, Dow Corning.
The announcement has caused more panic among American women than any medical decision since a contraceptive device, the Dalkon Shield, was removed from the market in 1974. Some 2m women have had implants, 80% of them for cosmetic reasons; the rest had ""reconstructive"" medical surgery following cancer treatment. The waiting list for implants by one Californian doctor used to be six months; it is now less than one month. Shares in implant makers have slumped.
Such second thoughts are overdue. For all its glittering advocates, cosmetic surgery is the only type of medicine where a perfectly healthy patient is cut up. (This, of course, omits reconstructive operations to repair burns or replace missing breasts.) Eight out of ten cosmetic operations are performed outside proper hospitals--some in operating rooms that look more like offices. Warnings of side-effects rarely appear in advertisements; nor do the records of the eager surgeons. Since it is ""elective"" surgery, not covered by insurance, few of the normal rules apply.
Inside the industry, rumours of malpractice are rife. One senior plastic surgeon says that he has a list of peers who ""he wouldn't let touch my dog's haemorrhoids"". The American Medical Association seldom intervenes; neither, until recently, did the FDA. The cosmetic industry itself is split into several warring associations, who refuse to co-operate even on statistics, let alone standards and certification.
BIGGER AND BIGGER
New rules may discipline the industry, but they are unlikely to stop it growing unless the American obsession with physical beauty sours. So far, surgeons say the recession has done more harm to their business than the bad publicity about breast implants; hence their confidence that trade will pick up. That still leaves two questions unanswered: why is cosmetic surgery so popular in America; and, even if it is safe, is it a good thing?
A string of global industries--fashion, cosmetics, fitness--show that it is not just Americans who want to look good. A few countries, notably Brazil and Japan, have fast-growing cosmetic-surgery businesses. But America stands out as the only country where cosmetic surgery carries virtually no stigma. That is partly the result of good marketing. As many as 15,000 doctors now rely on cosmetic surgery for a fair chunk of their income--and they are allowed to advertise aggressively.
However, on the whole, America's cosmetic-surgery business has been built on demand rather than supply. That demand comes from Americans of all ages, classes and races; One recent survey found that nearly one in three patients had an income below $25,000 a year--not much when most operations cost over $3,000.
According to the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, breast enlargement, which costs between $2,000 and $4,000, was only the tenth most popular cosmetic procedure in 1990. Topping the wish list was sclerotherapy (the removal of spider veins in the legs), followed by collagen injections to get rid of facial lines, then nose-jobs, lip-jobs and liposuction (fat removal). But among clients of the rival American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, breast enlargement, collagen injections and eyelid surgery were roughly equal as the three most popular operations.
When pushed to defend their trade, cosmetic surgeons argue that ""vanity surgery"" is often just an extension of reconstructive surgery. For example, redesigning the nose of a young boy, perpetually teased because of his prominent conk, can turn a problem teenager into a well-adjusted man. Cosmetic surgery follows two great American traditions: a refusal to surrender to an environment and a willingness to give people a second chance. What is the difference, some ask, between removing excess fat in an hour on the operating table and three months in the gym? ""I don't intend to grow old gracefully,"" says a woman in a television advertisement for an ambitious skin cream, ""I intend to fight it every step of the way.""
Many, however, admit that there is a darker side. Psychologists point out that many operations are not to get rid of deformity, but to make perfectly good looks even better. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that the beginning of the swimsuit season prompts a rush of breast implants; school reunions are good for the face-lift business.
GROWING OLD GRACELESSLY
Such competitive narcissism stretches into employment too. Larry Schoenrock of the University of California at San Francisco points out that good-looking people are more likely to get jobs. Most are women aiming to please prospective male bosses; but many male patients cite their careers as the chief reason for going under the scalpel. For ethnic minorities, the most popular operations are ones that change their racial characteristics. Asians want wider eyes; blacks want thinner lips. Critics say this is surrendering their identities to the white stereotypes that appear on the media. Surgeons say the point is more subtle: minorities want to de-emphasize rather than eradicate their looks. For example, one Californian surgeon says that many blacks specifically ask that, after their operations, they should not look like Michael Jackson, who now has a ""white"" nose and ""white"" skin.
Some trend-spotters detect the beginnings of a reaction against the knife. Non-surgical methods to reduce wrinkles, such as electronic massage machines, are selling fast. Last year the number of face-lifts completed increased by less than 1%. Cosmetic surgery can only hold back age; it cannot defeat it. Mr Jackson, who has been described as the Peter Pan of the music industry, might reflect on Maurice Chevalier's sanguine attitude to the appearance of a few wrinkles. ""I prefer old age to the alternative,"" he said.
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
Silicone breasts deceive men. That is their purpose (especially if the man is a film director). So, of course, do bras and lipstick, and so did corsets, crinolines and bustles in their day. If one school of biologists is right, men have been falling for tricks of this kind since long before the invention even of clothes, let alone cosmetic surgery. Bobbi Low and her colleagues at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor published a paper a few years ago that provoked a storm of indignation among anthropologists that still reverberates. Yet the critics have failed to fault her logic.
Dr Low starts with the fact that there is one peculiar thing about young women. Unless they are obese, the fat on their bodies is concentrated in three particular places: their hips, buttocks and breasts. Children, men and older women all distribute fat much more evenly, on their abdomen, thighs, upper arms. Why are young women different? Plainly, it must have something to do with the fact that they are of breeding age. But what?
The mundane reply is that it is simply a matter of storing energy for babies in places where it will not get in the way. If so, why not the upper arms and thighs? Dr Low thinks it is no coincidence that men like hourglass-shaped figures with large breasts and hips and thin waists. She suggests that men were selected by evolution to look for mates likely to be good at bearing and rearing children, so they picked the ones with big breasts (more milk) and wide hips (less difficult births). The narrow waist told them that these features were not caused by fat but tissue.
And it lied. Fat breasts (as opposed to breasts with more mammary tissue) are no better at making milk than fat-free ones; and fat hips are no better at bearing children than fat-free ones. Dr Low's theory is that adding fat in these places but not on the waist or limbs was a cheap way evolution found of mimicking desirable traits, and so of deceiving men.
This sexual selection theory is no more weird than most Freudian or sociological explanations of why men prefer big breasts, and has the virtue of not being arbitrary: it answers how it came about as well as why. It is, of course, like Freudianism and much of sociology, untestable and therefore almost wholly unprovable."

Something, certainly: think of how, trippingly off the tongue, everyone in American politics recalls that the president was christened George Herbert Walker and the vice-president J. Danforth. And so it is with Mr Bush's main rival for the Republican nomination this year. If your Christian names are Patrick Joseph and you are an ardent Roman Catholic who boasts of his fighting youth, then you should not be surprised if your image is that of a rough, tough Irishman, ready to biff all who stand in your way. And Pat Buchanan (personally, the most gracious of men) enjoys his reputation--even if he has been known to arrive at dinner parties with his own supply of non-alcoholic beer. The question is: who or what is he biffing?
When Mr Buchanan declared his candidacy for the presidency just before Christmas, he was immediately pegged as the candidate of conservatism. This was not surprising: Mr Buchanan's biography (a marvellous read, and not only for its politics) is called ""Right from the Beginning"". His intellectual hero in the 1950s was William Buckley, founder of the National Review; he idolised Barry Goldwater, and then Richard Nixon; he happily wrote speeches for Spiro Agnew and served two years in Ronald Reagan's White House. And, on television and in print since 1987, he has bashed and smashed every liberal he could find. For that reason above all, he is immensely popular among conservatives.
But Mr Buchanan appeals more to conservative hearts than to conservative minds. During the Reagan presidency ""conservatism"" became associated with love of God, country and traditional values. But conservatism also became merged with the more moderate Republican interest in free trade and free markets. Adam Smith's profile graced some Reaganite ties.
THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS
At least in rhetoric the Reagan presidency was committed to economic opportunity for all--including immigrants. Mr Reagan openly espoused a messianic vision of America's role in the world. America, he thought, had a moral responsibility to lead the rest of the world towards a better life. Mr Bush agrees.
It is these aspects of modern conservatism that Mr Buchanan seems to have rejected. He likes saying how tough he would be on matters of trade; how dismayed he is by the factories in New Hampshire (site of the first primary) that have lost their business to imports. He is scathing about the prospect of free trade with Mexico. Since, in 1988, Mr Buchanan spoke of trade wars with Asian countries as being acts of ""almost terminal stupidity for the West"", it is fair to ask if he has opportunistically changed his tune so that it harmonises with the current mood of the country--which is supposed to be isolationist. If so, he would not be the first politician to put a finger to the wind. But Mr Buchanan can fairly plead more consistency than is sometimes allowed him. In a revealing passage in his autobiography, he said, ""To me, America was a good country and a great country, long before she was a rich country; the business of America is not business. Ronald Reagan's economic agenda was not the reason some of us, as far back as 1975, urged him to challenge Gerald Ford.""
Similarly, the visionary foreign policy that imbued Mr Reagan and, in its own way, led Mr Bush into war with Iraq, holds no attraction for Mr Buchanan. He was an early and vocal opponent of the Gulf war. America's real war, he argued, was with communism; by 1990 it had been won. It was now time for America to ""come home"", to withdraw from entangling alliances and to concentrate its efforts on its domestic ills. And he has made no bones about his suspicion of immigration, at least of the non-white, non-European variety (which is the main variety now on offer).
In all this he appeals to a conservatism that is older than that espoused by either Mr Nixon (no isolationist he) or Mr Reagan. It has more in common with the anti-immigrant sentiment of the America First movement in the 1930s and with the small-town conservatism of Robert Taft, who, opposing the Marshall Plan and NATO, sought his party's nomination in 1948 and 1952. Indeed Mr Buchanan has consciously picked up the ""America First"" slogan (as has the third Republican presidential candidate, David Duke, a white racist from Louisiana).
The questions that Mr Buchanan's candidacy pose are these: were the economic and foreign policies of Mr Reagan an integral part of the success of Republicans (and Republican ideas) in the 1980s? Or can a Republicanism that dispenses with those policies command majority support? None of the post-war Republican presidents--Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford or Reagan--chose to run on policies of economic nationalism and diplomatic isolationism; it is reasonable to assume that they knew what they were doing.
That is why one casualty of a powerful Buchanan campaign might be the very Republican party he so loves. In the 1980s the Republicans succeeded in appealing to many apolitical younger voters, and to a small, but growing, number of blacks and Hispanics, partly because they were able to paint themselves as anything but old-fashioned and exclusive. It is that legacy that Mr Buchanan's highly visible candidacy puts at risk.
Last summer Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, chief rival to Mr Buchanan for conservatives' affection, but a man who remains committed to every part of the the Reagan legacy, spoke at a lunch in Los Angeles before hundreds of well-dressed, upwardly mobile, youngish Hispanics. Few seemed to have heard him before, but once they had got used to his Niagara-like speaking style, they cheered his message of economic opportunity for all to the echo. Such people are the future of the Republican Party, and they are not going to vote for Pat Buchanan."

Those whose melancholy duty it is to analyse his talks there may come to a similar conclusion.
The president arrived in Japan on January 7th hoping to depart three days later with a list of goodies that would help him get re-elected in November. But Mr Bush lost at tennis (playing the emperor and the crown prince) and did not do much better in the rest of the games. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister for less than three months, has been in no position to deliver anything. The Americans must take some of blame for the misunderstandings that dogged the talks.
The two leaders were supposed to have met last November. Mr Bush postponed the trip after criticism that he preferred globetrotting to fixing the economy at home. At the time, just before the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, the two men had been planning to reaffirm their mutual dependence and look forward to the next 50 years of friendly co-operation. Mr Miyazawa saw this as his chance to show his famous diplomatic skills and recover some of the prestige that Japan had lost abroad through its dilly-dallying at the time of the Gulf war. Japan set to work to draft a ""Tokyo Declaration"", a high-minded document about sharing responsibility for maintaining peace and prosperity in the region.
But the moment passed. American emotions about Pearl Harbour subsided. Mr Miyazawa muffed legislation that would have allowed Japan to send troops abroad on United Nations peacekeeping missions, and thus shoulder some of the global responsibilities being talked about. Mr Bush found himself suddenly in election year. With 8.5m Americans out of work, and America's trade deficit with Japan nosing back towards $42 billion, this was, his advisers advised, the time to get tough. Bashing Japan for not buying enough goods made in America should, it was argued, go down well in Detroit.
For courtesy's sake, Mr Miyazawa has been given his Tokyo Declaration. This expresses the two countries' vague determination to work together for a new world order. But the week's meetings were mainly about an Action Plan that defines various market-opening measures that the Americans want. A third document, the Macroeconomic Accord, was also released during the meetings, due to end on January 10th. Mr Miyazawa may have thought he would spend the week looking noble on the world stage. Instead, he has been asked to make grubby concessions over money and markets.
What have the Americans gained? Two dozen Japanese companies have been bullied into buying more manufactured goods from abroad. The Action Plan talks of them buying $26.4 billion worth of foreign goods a year by early 1994, up by $10.2 billion over their imports in 1990. ""Foreign"", as all good Japanese know, means American. The Japanese may or may not chip in something towards an $8.25 billion atom-smashing machine that American scientists want to build in Texas. Nine Japanese car manufacturers have outlined plans for buying $19 billion-worth of components from America by 1994 (see page 60).
Though they are already widely known, the import targets for American cars ($6.4 billion worth by 1994) have not been put in the plan. No one in Japan wants to be blamed for breaking a written promise--as happened when the Semi-conductor Accord of 1986 recklessly guaranteed American chip makers 20% of the Japanese market. Mr Miyazawa has also offered to relax import-inspection standards that have irked the Americans on more than 50 items.
The Action Plan refers to reports by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission on practices in the motor, car-component, glass and paper industries that bar competition. The commission's investigations were approved at the Structural Impediment Initiative talks in 1990 on barriers restricting trade between Japan and America. The Action Plan calls for a ""re-invigoration"" of those talks--with some new topics added at America's insistence.
The Americans will gain access to $5 billion-worth of trade insurance covering the next five years. The cash is for underwriting Japanese overseas projects in which American firms take part, such as building power stations in Latin America and drilling for oil in Siberia. The scheme came into effect last May and has so far provided some $700m of Japanese government insurance for six overseas projects--helping American firms export $2 billion-worth of goods.
On the tricky issue of rice, the Americans have been urging Japan to accept GATT proposals for replacing import restrictions on agricultural products with tariffs. This would help bring the Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks to a successful conclusion. But the ruling Liberal Democrats are afraid of offending Japan's farmers before July's election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament). Mr Miyazawa knows that amending the law that bans all but token rice imports is out of the question. One idea being discussed is to impose huge tariffs of 700% on imported rice; another is to allow 300,000 tons of foreign rice into Japan for use in famine-relief operations elsewhere.
When are added up, the measures announced this week will buy few jobs for Americans. They may even backfire on Mr Bush in the months ahead. Expectations have been rising in Washington that Japan's latest market-opening measures are somehow different from the dozens that have gone before. All have helped, bit by bit, to make the Japanese market more accessible to foreigners, but none has allowed Japan's trading partners to eliminate their deficits. Mr Bush's efforts will be no different.
Yet in one way this week's talks have been different. They are the first bilateral negotiations between America and Japan since the collapse of Soviet communism. With the Russian presence in the Pacific diminishing, a nearly-nuclear North Korea edging out of its long period of moody isolation, and an increasingly capitalist China eager for western aid, America has quietly begun to redefine its relations with Japan. From valued ally, Japan is being cast increasingly as a dangerous competitor, more of a threat than an opportunity.

Those whose melancholy duty it is to analyse his talks there may come to a similar conclusion.
The president arrived in Japan on January 7th hoping to depart three days later with a list of goodies that would help him get re-elected in November. But Mr Bush lost at tennis (playing the emperor and the crown prince) and did not do much better in the rest of the games. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister for less than three months, has been in no position to deliver anything. The Americans must take some of blame for the misunderstandings that dogged the talks.
The two leaders were supposed to have met last November. Mr Bush postponed the trip after criticism that he preferred globetrotting to fixing the economy at home. At the time, just before the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, the two men had been planning to reaffirm their mutual dependence and look forward to the next 50 years of friendly co-operation. Mr Miyazawa saw this as his chance to show his famous diplomatic skills and recover some of the prestige that Japan had lost abroad through its dilly-dallying at the time of the Gulf war. Japan set to work to draft a ""Tokyo Declaration"", a high-minded document about sharing responsibility for maintaining peace and prosperity in the region.
But the moment passed. American emotions about Pearl Harbour subsided. Mr Miyazawa muffed legislation that would have allowed Japan to send troops abroad on United Nations peacekeeping missions, and thus shoulder some of the global responsibilities being talked about. Mr Bush fund himself suddenly in election year. With 8.5m Americans out of work, and America's trade deficit with Japan nosing back towards $42 billion, this was, his advisers advised, the time to get tough. Bashing Japan for not buying enough goods made in America should, it was argued, go down well in Detroit.
For courtesy's sake, Mr Miyazawa has been given his Tokyo Declaration. This expresses the two countries' vague determination to work together for a new world order. But the week's meetings were mainly about an Action Plan that defines various market-opening measures that the Americans want. A third document, the Macroeconomic Accord, was also released during the meetings, due to end on January 10th. Mr Miyazawa may have thought he would spend the week looking noble on the world stage. Instead, he has been asked to make grubby concessions over money and markets.
What have the Americans gained? Two dozen Japanese companies have been bullied into buying more manufactured goods from abroad. The Action Plan talks of them buying $26.4 billion worth of foreign goods a year by early 1994, up by $10.2 billion over their imports in 1990. ""Foreign"", as all good Japanese know, means American. The Japanese may or may not chip in something towards an $8.25 billion atom-smashing machine that American scientists want to build in Texas. Nine Japanese car manufacturers have outlined plans for buying $19 billion-worth of components from America by 1994 (see page 60).
Though they are already widely known, the import targets for American cars ($6.4 billion worth by 1994) have not been put in the plan. No one in Japan wants to be blamed for breaking a written promise--as happened when the Semi-conductor Accord of 1986 recklessly guaranteed American chip makers 20% of the Japanese market. Mr Miyazawa has also offered to relax import-inspection standards that have irked the Americans on more than 50 items.
The Action Plan refers to reports by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission on practices in the motor, car-component, glass and paper industries that bar competition. The commission's investigations were approved at the Structural Impediment Initiative talks in 1990 on barriers restricting trade between Japan and America. The Action Plan calls for a ""re-invigoration"" of those talks--with some new topics added at America's insistence.
The Americans will gain access to $5 billion-worth of trade insurance covering the next five years. The cash is for underwriting Japanese overseas projects in which American firms take part, such as building power stations in Latin America and drilling for oil in Siberia. The scheme came into effect last May and has so far provided some $700m of Japanese government insurance for six overseas projects--helping American firms export $2 billion-worth of goods.
On the tricky issue of rice, the Americans have been urging Japan to accept GATT proposals for replacing import restrictions on agricultural products with tariffs. This would help bring the Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks to a successful conclusion. But the ruling Liberal Democrats are afraid of offending Japan's farmers before July's election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament). Mr Miyazawa knows that amending the law that bans all but token rice imports is out of the question. One idea being discussed is to impose huge tariffs of 700% on imported rice; another is to allow 300,000 tons of foreign rice into Japan for use in famine-relief operations elsewhere.

PROMISES, PROMISES
""We will stay involved,"" President Bush promised in Australia, the first stop on his Pacific tour, ""right up till the end of eternity."" Never mind the oxymoron. Mr Bush talked much more sense in Asia about the balance of power than about the balance of trade. Even so, both he and his hosts remain pretty much in the dark about America's role in Asia's defence now that the Soviet Union is gone.
How can America best perform the important function, which used to be hidden under the anti-Soviet mantle, of keeping the power balance between regional rivals like Japan, China, India and the Koreas? What is the right task and size for America's Seventh Fleet, especially in relation to Russia's Pacific fleet? Should America rely on its bilateral defence ties, or would a multilateral security system along European lines now make sense?
Nobody yet has the answers. But all agree that for Asia's stability America should not stage any immediate retreat from the region. Hence the declaration by Mr Bush's defence secretary, Richard Cheney, that after the 10% reductions in American forces in Japan and South Korea over the past two years, ""I do not expect further significant reductions in Asia for the time being, or the Pacific. It is very important that the United States stay forward deployed in the Pacific."" The president stressed the same point in his press conference in Tokyo on January 9th.
That will, however, require what American officials admit is some ""adjustment""--not least because the Philippines has at last unequivocally told the Americans to leave their Subic Bay naval base by the end of this year. America's admirals are not much fussed. They think that in these more relaxed days the tasks done at Subic can be parcelled out elsewhere.
In 1990, for example, Singapore gave American ships and fighter aircraft the right to port calls for operations and repairs. When Mr Bush arrived in Singapore after Australia, he won agreement for the transfer there of a logistics command now at Subic Bay: it will be the first permanent stationing of American forces in Singapore since 1945. America will next seek military calling rights from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
The only other urgent matter on Mr Bush's defence agenda was North Korea's nuclear programme. In South Korea, the penultimate stop on his tour, Mr Bush again demanded that the North submit to international inspection of its nuclear sites and gave warning of the danger of ""paper promises"", suggesting that he was unconvinced by the nuclear renunciation made by the North in its accord with the South on December 31st.
Inching forward, the North said this week in Vienna that it would sign a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency before the end of the month. Eager to please, the South promptly announced the suspension of this year's springtime military exercise with the Americans--presumably miffing Mr Bush, who had said in Seoul the exercise would be called off only after the North had submitted to inspections.
In Japan, now (with the demise of the Soviet Union) probably the world's second biggest military spender, Mr Bush and his hosts declared that in the next Gulf-like emergency America and Japan must act as fully cooperating partners. It seemed, however, that the question of how to build Asia's post-cold-war security structure was ignored. The arduous job of peddling American cars in Japan did not leave time for this minor matter."

This owes much to the winter snows, which make campaigning difficult, a little to the support of most mujaheddin for a peace settlement, and nothing at all to ""negative symmetry"", the much-vaunted agreement under which America and the Soviet Union stopped sending guns to the rival Afghan factions from January 1st.
Neither army nor mujaheddin are short of arms: their stockpiles could keep the war going for years. Moreover, both are confident that any gaps in their armouries would be filled by other friendly countries.
The radical mujaheddin, who reject the United Nations' peace plan for a ceasefire, a broad-based interim government and democratic elections, are counting on continued support from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The Saudi government, angry at the support some mujaheddin gave to Saddam Hussein in the Gulfwar, has trimmed its aid, but private Saudi money still arrives. Pakistan says it supports the UN plan, and has even threatened to expel Afghan groups who oppose it, but the Pakistani armed forces (whose intelligence service, the ISI, has directed the mujaheddin since 1980) still want a military solution to produce a pro-Pakistan government in Kabul.
Virtually abandoned by Russia, which is anxious to win freedom for 70 or so of its soldiers still held by the mujaheddin, President Najibullah has approached India and China for arms. More important, however, is his effort to cultivate the newly independent Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union--especially Turkmenia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, all of which have ethnic ties to Afghanistan itself.
The abortive coup against Mikhail Gorbachev last August seemed at first to be good for the UN peace plan, but bad for Mr Najibullah personally. Soon after the attempted coup, the Soviet Union appeared to give the plan a boost by dropping its demand that Mr Najibullah should take part in it. But the subsequent break-up of the Soviet Union has helped the Afghan leader. The Central Asian republics are run by men similar to himself: communists-turned-nationalists who will tolerate state-controlled Islam but who hate the idea of a radical Islamic government in Kabul as much as Mr Najibullah does. They may not provide him with arms. But they have supplied much of the 900,000 tonnes of fuel and 500,000 tonnes of wheat that Afghanistan needs to import to get through the winter.
There is, however, a complication for Mr Najibullah. While the Central Asian republics will oppose a fundamentalist regime in Kabul of the kind favoured by Pakistan's army, they will also champion the rights of the Turkmen, Uzbek and Tajik minorities in any post-war settlement. These minorities and others such as the Hazaras and the Baluchis, traditionally ceded political control to the majority Pathans. But 12 years of civil war have made them more assertive. Ahmed Shah Masood, a celebrated mujaheddin commander, has carved out a small Tajik state in the northeast; he would resist ceding authority to Kabul. A settlement that ignores such factors will lead only to ethnic conflict.
Meanwhile, despite the rockets, morale in Kabul has risen. Though prices are high, the bazaars are well stocked: fruit comes from Pakistan, televisions from South Korea, and army-surplus jackets from the ex-Soviet Union. Government shops are managing to keep soldiers and state employees warm, well fed and relatively comfortable. With a military stalemate that favours the defender, and a clutch of new friends on the northern borders, President Najibullah may feel more secure than at any time since before the Soviet army's departure from Afghanistan in February 1989."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136155/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/17?accountid=14657,"A myth about Cambodia is that it is a land well-endowed by nature. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the restored head of state, likes to paint a picture of his ""children"" (the peasants) living a life of Arcadian plenty in a natural ricebowl, their idyll ended only by the civil war.
The truth is less agreeable. Rice farmers, four-fifths of Cambodia's workforce, ""have always been poor and probably always will be,"" says Harry Nesbitt, the Phnom Penh representative of the International Rice Research Institute.
The soil is mostly sandy. Rainfall is irregular. Last year in the western province of Battambang, the most fertile in Cambodia, the rains were late, making the soil too hard for planting. When the rains did finally start in September, there was too much water--large areas were under 30-40 centimetres (12-16 inches) of water for more than a month. In many areas of the country there are not enough draught animals to help with the ploughing. Fertiliser has been scarce since Soviet aid for Cambodia ended early last year.
In a good year, a Cambodian farmer may be able to produce 2 tonnes of rice from a hectare (212 acres) of land. In neihbouring Thailand, yields of more than 4.5 tonnes are customary. During the past decade Cambodia has been persistently short of food. In 1991 it is estimated to have produced 200,000 tonnes less than it needed to feed its people properly. Food aid covered only part of this deficit, so many went hungry.
Set against this precarious background, it becomes less surprising that the Khmers Rouges managed to create a famine during almost four years of rule. The devastated country they seized in April 1975 was already hungry. Pol Pot decided to launch a great leap forward, which would imitate China's in everything but speed--Cambodia's was to take only a fraction of the time As the nation was returned to ""year zero"", all townspeople were sent to work in the fields, where loudspeakers shrieked at them that ""rice means everything.""
The results were disastrous and are still being felt today. The Khmers Rouges decided that only modern, ""communist"" varieties of rice could be used. Peasants were stopped from using deep-water rice, which grows to more than 3 metres (10 feet) and quickly enough to survive on flooded land. (Efforts by the International Rice Research Institute to reintroduce deep-water rice have been successful but slow: last year it was planted on 107,000 hectares of land, compared with 400,000-450,000 hectares in 1965.)
The Khmers Rouges murdered most of Cambodia's agronomists. In 1975 the country had more than 300 people teaching farmers how to increase their yields. Fewer than 30 survived the killing fields. The former townspeople were forced to dig canals and make dykes. The design for these grandiose waterworks was based on the 1-kilometre grids on military maps left behind by the Americans. Canals followed these lines regardless of topography. No one dared to question the practice. Canals were dug to the edge of a village or hill and begun again on the far side. It is estimated that fewer than a fifth of these schemes worked. In some places they have disrupted natural water supplies and caused erosion, reducing rice yields still further.
There are fewer peasants to work the land than there used to be. Untold numbers died in the Khmer Rouge years. Others have been killed or maimed in the civil war, often by mines. Now that the war is over, at least in theory, few ex-soldiers wish to return to the hard life of growing rice, or ""Arcadia"", as Prince Sihanouk prefers to call it."

They had been elected on the Chinese mainland in 1948--and had not bothered the voters since. Taiwan-elected opposition members, more apt to hurl abuse at them in debate, gave them bouquets of flowers; the taxpayers gave them each a large cheque.
But what had these ancients achieved? Many of them feel they have contributed to Taiwan's economic and political progress. Others feel betrayed--first used by the Kuomintang to rubber-stamp its rule on Taiwan after being ousted from the mainland by Mao's communists in 1949, and now discarded as a political liability.
The departure of the old guard rids the government of the physical memory of the corrupt military regime of Chiang Kai-shek that fled to Taiwan from the mainland. The party now wants to be seen as a rejuvenated force that will mature again with Taiwan's new democratic politics. Its television campaign to elect a new National Assembly last month (the party won a resounding 71% of the vote for the body which amends the constitution and elects the president) showed a new-born child rolling around naked on the party flag. The message doubtless holds for the Legislative Yuan election at the end of this year.
Moreover, President Lee Teng-hui, who is the Taiwan-born chairman of the Kuomintang, has begun tilting the balance of power in the government and the army from the conservative mainland-born factions toward his fellow reform-minded technocrats. Under the nose of his mainland-born prime minister and former chief of staff, Hau Pei-tsun, he has replaced some top military officers with his own men.
Yet the Kuomintang remains a Leninist-style monolith, with a structure not unlike that of its old enemy, the Chinese Communist Party. Its election win last month has only served to intensify the struggle between its various conservative and reformist factions. There are rumours that it plans to do away with party primaries. These were introduced for the first time for a limited parliamentary poll in 1989, in which the Kuomintang lost ground to the then-illegal Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
But though the DPP was soon to emerge as the main opposition, it still has some growing-up to do if it is to be an effective one. Its leader, Hsu Hsin-liang, blamed widespread Kuomintang vote-buying and domination of television for the DPP's poor performance in the National Assembly election (it gained 23% of the vote, compared with 30% in 1989). But there was more to it than that. The DPP is stricken with bitter factionalism over its belief in independence for Taiwan, and has a reputation for violence among its ranks. Mr Hsu admits that his party lacks the Kuomintang's clear lines of command from the centre down to small local cells. Many candidates sang their own songs before the election, failing to disseminate clearly the party's radical new call for Taiwan to break its treasured links with mainland China.
Perhaps foreseeing this, the Kuomintang last year reduced the size of the electoral districts for the National Assembly to its own advantage. It proposes similar gerrymandering for this year's parliamentary election. In the meantime, the parliament, numbering 760 in 1948, now has only 125 members, all elected in Taiwan. Without the so-called ""old thieves"" to vilify and berate, the chamber could well degenerate into a jungle of self-interested warlordism.
Even so, after 40 years Taiwan's thought-control is ending and a two-party democracy is emerging. Would that the same were true on the mainland."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139347/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/19?accountid=14657,"Like Mikhail Gorbachev, Algeria's President Chadli Benjedid has ushered in more reform than he bargained for. Having prised his country democratically open, he finds his countrymen choosing a form of government that goes well beyond any plans that he might once have had. Yet, unless something nasty jumps out from behind mosque or barracks--and the Islamic fundamentalists have been hinting at the dire possibility of an army coup--the signs are that the president will stick by the democratic experiment he instigated.
The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) is poised to win the run-off elections on January 16th, having triumphed in the first round on December 26th. For an absolute majority in parliament it needs to win only 28 of the 188 districts where there was no overall winner in December; since it already leads in three-quarters of these seats, it can probably do far better than that without much trouble. Even if the Constitutional Council, which on January 11th will pronounce on all the electoral fouls that the losing parties allege they have discovered, finds that some districts must hold their elections again, this is unlikely to affect the completeness of the FIS's victory.
The anti-Islamists are hoping for some democratic joy from the 5m Algerians (out of an electorate of 13m) who did not vote in the first round. The FIS, not yet three years old and a social and religious movement rather than an organised party, did a much better job than the secular parties in getting out the vote--and will continue to galvanise its followers with the fiery rallies planned for January 13th. Some of the earlier non-voters may now be haunted by the imminent spectre of an Islamic state, but there is no reason to suppose that many of them will gather behind what is now, in most districts, their only alternative: the corrupt, fossilised collection of chieftains and hacks, called the National Liberation Front (FLN), that has been running Algeria ever since the glory days of its fight for independence.
The assumption must be that, by the second half of this month, Islamic fundamentalists will dominate Algeria's parliament and so have a logical claim on its government. Under the constitution, the president appoints the prime minister who then nominates his ministers, some of whom (for defence and foreign affairs) are directly responsible to the president. But it would cause deadlock--and subsequent chaos--to have a government antipathetic to the Islamic majority in parliament.
The FIS is expected to push for the appointment of its leader, Abbasi Madani, who remains locked up awaiting military trial on conspiracy and subversion charges. It seems inevitable, and sensible, that Mr Madani and his fellow-prisoners are now swiftly released. But both sides, if they are anxious to avoid direct confrontation, will be striving for a temporary compromise. The search is on for a prime minister acceptable to both Islamic and secular forces; one of the better names to surface is Ahmed Talib Ibrahimi, a former foreign minister who belongs to the FLN's Islamic wing.
It is probable, though by no means certain, that the FIS will move in a restrained way towards its unrestrained aims. It believes, as its manifesto says, in an Islamic state in which ""Islam is the ideological reference point embracing all aspects of life"". But the party is roughly divided between those who believe that Algeria should find its own way to Islamic rule (the Djezara wing, which is currently in the ascendant) and the radicals (the Salafiya wing) who demand sweeping social changes.
The FIS pragmatists are talking of a period of cohabitation with the presidency. Their freedom to push for immediate reform is checked by constitutional constraints--and by the fact that they operate under the shadow of the Algerian army. Abdelkader Hashani, the FIS's acting leader, gave warning this week that the army and security forces, which intervened bloodily in October 1988 and again last June, were once more deployed in force throughout the country. The FIS has been careful, this time, not to provoke the kind of disorder that would give the president a pretext to bring the army in. A coup cannot be ruled out, dismal and retrograde though it would be.
Yet coexistence, at best, will be bumpy. Under the constitution, the president has the power to dissolve a defiant parliament and to call for new elections. A number of bodies are specifically empowered to protect constitutional rights. If the new parliament passes the kind of social laws that are expected of it--to restrict the right of women to work away from the home, to send girls to segregated schools, to ban contraception and to make all forms of alcohol illegal--these laws will be challenged.
There may be less controversy on the economic front, though nobody, at this stage, can really tell. The FIS is an economically liberal party, strongly supported by small businessmen and in favour of private enterprise. Mr Madani, when at liberty to do so, has gone out of his way to reassure foreign businessmen on questions of trade and investment. But other leaders sound a xenophobic note, perhaps warning away multinational companies that had been contemplating new forms of joint venture.
The party's headache, when its celebrations come to an end, will be how to keep its promises to the disinherited: the unemployed young, the urban families scrunched into a single waterless room, the hopeless and the angry. Banning some women from some jobs may provide a bit of work for some men. The FIS may win plaudits sharing out a little of the exaggerated wealth and property of Algeria's rich. But these reforms would be symbolic, at best. The only thing that would bring a quick change to the country's miseries--a rise in the price of oil and gas--is not in the hands of even God's messengers.
Algeria, says one of the FIS leaders, should become an Islamic state ""inspired by the experiences of Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan"". His words inspire the fear of many people. But Algerians have always seen themselves as leaders of the developing world, not as followers--let alone of such lamentable examples. They are unlikely to change. Besides, it is hard to isolate a people behind an Islamic veil when one-third of them have easy access to French culture and news from their satellite television sets."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139438/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/20?accountid=14657,"In Madrid last October the Arab-Israeli peace negotiation was still a lusty infant. Now, less than three months later, it stumbles like an old man from one pitfall into another. Goodwill, scarce enough in Madrid, had vanished by the time the Arabs and Israelis got together for a second round in December. The third round was delayed, thanks to Israel's announcement, just before the talks were supposed to resume in Washington on January 7th, that it intended to deport a dozen Palestinians from the occupied territories.
One group briefly happy with the deportations was the 100,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Four of their number had been killed in Palestinian ambushes since the eve of the Madrid conference. Diplomatically, though, the deportations were a disaster. On January 6th they won Israel the unanimous condemnation of the United Nations Security Council. And if they were intended to provoke the Palestinians to boycott the talks, they failed. Indeed, they made it easier for the Americans to give a visa to Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser from the Palestine Liberation Organisation who had been refused entry to Washington last time round.
Critics of the deportations call the episode a classic case of Israel's tail (the West Bank settlers) wagging the dog (the elected government). This misses the point. The settlers are a noisy lot, whose wilder tactics sometimes embarrass the government. But in their enthusiasm for a Greater Israel, and their refusal to yield up territory as the price of peace, they are at one with the prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir.
The fuss over the deportations underlines the dilemma Mr Shamir faces as the talks limp on. To maintain the economic support of the United States, he has no choice but to take part in them. But he dares not alienate his friends and allies at home by going soft on the Arabs and the Palestinian uprising, the intifada. Worse still, Israel is obliged, by the Camp David accords of 1978, to offer ""autonomy""--self-rule under Israeli supervision--to the Palestinians living under occupation. The settlers see self-rule as the thin end of a wedge that would end with an independent Palestine in the West Bank, and their patrons in the cabinet think so too.
Tehiya and Moledet, two small secular right-wing parties, have threatened to bring down the Likud-led coalition if Mr Shamir lets his negotiators bring forward the autonomy proposals in Washington. Threats like this have been made before, and have turned out to be a bluff. Mr Shamir insists that he cares not when the next general election is held--it is due by November at the latest--but he would like to wait a little longer. June is now being bandied about as the preferred date. An early election would halt the peace talks in their tracks.
Some Greater Israelis cling to the hope that George Bush's domestic worries will spare Israel some trouble. With the recession-battered United States moving towards its own election in November, they say, Mr Bush cannot relish another battle with Israel's friends in Congress. Yet a confrontation may be unavoidable. By mid-January the United States is to reconsider Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees to finance the integration of hundreds of thousands of new Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The chances of Israel receiving these guarantees are now slimmer than ever.
The reason is Israel's new budget, approved on January 3rd after three days of stormy parliamentary debate. The religious parties in Mr Shamir's coalition made their customary bids for money for their supporters, and got more or less what they wanted. But this time the far right got in on the act too. With the Tehiya-Moledet threats ringing in his ears, Mr Shamir agreed to boost spending in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by an extra $90m--to include the building of 5,000 new homes for Jews, plus new roads and factories. Two-thirds of state-financed building scheduled for 1992 is to take place beyond the pre-1967 border, grist to the mill of those who argue, in Washington and elsewhere, that the Jewish settlements are a barrier to peace.
Given his known views on Israel's settlement drive, this budget is a provocation that not even a weakened Mr Bush can easily ignore. The administration is toying with the idea of deducting whatever Israel spends on settlements from the money it receives from the United States. Congress, while sympathetic to Israel, has noticed that Americans are even less keen than they used to be about foreign aid in general. At best Mr Shamir might get guarantees to cover $2 billion of loans, which is far too little to stave off what looks like impending disaster for Israel's economy and, in particular, for new Soviet immigrants. Likud ministers are talking about new taxes, belt-tightening and the need for world Jewry to do its bit."

It wants a non-racial election for a constituent assembly which, by the end of 1992, would draft a new constitution for South Africa. President F.W. de Klerk has already told the newly established Convention for a Democratic South Africa that he wants, as soon as possible, a transitional government based on a transitional constitution and including black people. It seems both sides want change fast, on the way to a non-racial future. But it is not as easy as that.
The present constitution offers no place at all for black people. The ANC demands that it should be promptly repealed and replaced by an interim government, drawn from the main parties at the convention. Its principal job would be to organise free and fair elections for a constituent assembly that could finish its work in a year.
Mr de Klerk and his National Party colleagues are against creating a constitutional vacuum, even briefly. To preserve the proprieties, they want to bring in a transitional constitution, making space for blacks as well as for whites, Indians and Coloured (mixed-race) people. Under this constitution, elections would be held for a new parliament, soon. This new parliament, not the ANC's proposed constituent assembly, would hammer out a definitive constitution. The transitional constitution and parliament would last at least five years; the minister for constitutional affairs, Gerrit Viljoen, has talked of it lasting one or two five-year parliamentary terms, instead of the few months the ANC demands.
The president says that both he and his predecessor, P.W. Botha, promised white electors that they would be consulted, in an election or by referendum, before big constitutional changes were made. The ANC says this amounts to giving the white minority a veto over constitutional proposals emerging from the convention; it suspects that Mr de Klerk plans to ""legitimise"" the present parliament (with chambers for whites, Indians and Coloureds) by grafting on a fourth, black chamber, and calls this unacceptable.
Mr de Klerk insists that he has no plans for a new chamber, and points to the draft scheme put forward by the National Party (which, in this context, is not clearly distinguishable from the government). The party rules out racially separate voters' rolls or representation, and calls for non-racial adult suffrage. It wants to prevent abuses of power by an amazing range of checks and balances, including: proportional representation; an entrenched constitution, prescribing power-sharing at ministerial level; a bill of rights; a three- or five-person presidency with a rotating chairman; and a strong second chamber, weighted in favour of smaller parties.
When the National Party produced its scheme, Mr Mandela rejected it as a recipe for chaos, designed to protect white people's privileges. The ANC now says it is prepared to consider the proposals, while remaining set against any device that would legitimise the present constitution. The ANC seems to fear that Mr de Klerk wants to lure it into ""collaboration"", but the suspicions go both way. Mr de Klerk has said straight out that the ANC cannot be trusted with power. In a constituent assembly elected by straightforward adult suffrage, the ANC would fairly surely be the biggest party. As such, it might claim to rule the country, as well as writing the new constitution.
It all sounds negative. But both the ANC and the National Party want to be sure that a settlement is not wrecked by fanatics, black or white. To start the year, white right-wingers bombed public buildings, while murderers of the Azanian People's Army, an instrument of the Pan Africanist Congress, ambushed and killed some black policemen. More of that is what the two established political movements want to avert."

Representatives of El Salvador's elected government and of its main opponent, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, had agreed that they must agree. They did so near midnight on December 31st, to reward the peacemaking efforts of the UN's outgoing secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar. By October, when the FMLN has promised to lay down its arms, El Salvador's civil war may at last be over. More than 70,000 people have perished in the dozen years of fighting.
Wariness continues, and so does violence. As the new-year announcement came over the radio, rebel fighters in their camps among the volcanoes wept for joy, but kept cleaning their weapons. Right-wing zealots blew up a jeep belonging to the Reuters news agency, and kidnapped a priest. The leading right-wing newspaper, Diario de Hoy, gave warning that ""the beasts which once roamed outside are now inside the house"". The strife in El Salvador, fomented by outsiders from the start, had its roots in the poverty and social injustice of Central America's most densely populated country. Only when the peace is definite can such deep-rooted ills be cured.
Yet praise is due to the peacemakers, notably to Mr Perez de Cuellar, and his special representative (and fellow Peruvian) Alvaro de Soto, who was promptly confirmed in his work by the UN's new secretary general, Boutros Boutros Ghali. Without the artificial deadline of Mr Perez de Cuellar's retirement, agreement might not have been reached for weeks, if at all.
Peace, like war, has its own momentum. Immediately after the signing, in a New York cafe, a casual meeting between American officials and FMLN commanders led to further and more businesslike encounters between those sworn adversaries. The Americans assured the rebels that they really want reform in El Salvador; the State Department's chief Latin America man, Bernard Aronson, told the New York Times: ""It was important to let them know that the war was over for us too.""
The FMLN is giving up the fight partly because its leaders know that they will get no more supplies from their one-time backers, the defunct Soviet Union and its Cuban and Nicaraguan surrogates. The guerrillas, having lived on cornmeal in the bush for more than a decade, may be lad of a rest. Anyway, they think they have won much of what they were fighting for. If the government and its army keep their side of the bargain, that could be true.
The worry is that the details of the government's concessions are not yet clear, though it seems that it has agreed to extend its tentative programme of land reform, and to guarantee security of tenure to peasants now occupying property in guerrilla-controlled zones. That will displease some of the rich landowners who have given their support to Alfredo Cristiani's ruling Arena Party, not to mention the much more resolute, and violent, capitalists of El Salvador's militant right.
The army and police have been thrown deep into uncertainty. By November 1993 half of the 56,000-strong Salvadorean army is to be disbanded. A new police force is to be created, controlled by a civilian minister, not a soldier.
In the army, some officers seem willing to co-operate in the peace. But many, reluctant to show their discontent at losing the only jobs they are trained for, will no doubt try to throw spanners in the works. ""Those are the most dangerous,"" said Ruben Zamora, vice-president of El Salvador's National Assembly and head of the moderately left-win Democratic Convergence. A Christian Democratic member of parliament, Gerardo Le Chevalier, believes the recalcitrant soldiers need to be pushed into line with help from the American military advisers who, he says, know more. than they tell about human-rights abuses and crimes in which the army has been involved.
During much of the civil war, El Salvador had a moderate Christian Democratic president, and the United States backed him. But the army the Americans created to counter what they saw as the communist threat in Central America was a disappointment from the start. Militarily, it showed how helicopters and howitzers can lose fights against small-arms and light mortars. Politically, it exposed itself to accusations of murder whose investigation it methodically frustrated. Administratively, it filled its American advisers' dossiers with evidence of corruption. For example, the new year's peace accord was followed by a stiff drive to round up forced recruits. Senior officers, it seemed, needed people to fill the places of the ""phantom soldiers"" whose pay they had been drawing to supplement their formal salaries.
The Americans now seem minded to use what they know about corruption in the army, to give President Cristiani the help he will badly need if the military scoundrels are to be disciplined. Mr Cristiani went to New York to see that the draft peace plan was signed in time. With many details still unclear or still in contention, he has declared the transition to peace irreversible. The Salvadorean military representative at the talks, Colonel Mauricio Vargas, was more cautious. He said the transition would be difficult, and that the accord signified ""the end of the war, not peace""."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224146502/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/23?accountid=14657,"There are days when Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's leader, must feel as if he were at the wheel of a runaway bus. January 7th was one of them. The latest ceasefire was holding better than its 14 predecessors. Prospects for a United Nations peacekeeping plan for Yugoslavia, which Serbia favours, looked good. Mr Milosevic had assured Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, that the Serb barons and their militias in the Serb-held bits of Croatia were under control and that the Yugoslav army backed the peacekeeping plan.
He should have added ""as far as I know"". For on Tuesday afternoon over northeastern Croatia, a jet fighter from the Yugoslav air force shot down a helicopter carrying a European Community observation team, killing all five men aboard. The white painted helicopter was clearly marked and had given notice of its flight plan. The Croats' only known aircraft are converted crop-dusters and, though slow like helicopters, the two are hard to confuse. The attack took place far from any conflict zone during a ceasefire. The head of the air force has been suspended.
As neither Mr Milosevic nor the federal high command had a clear interest in creating an incident at this moment, the presumption is that the attack was the work of rogue officers in the air force who want the war to continue and the peacekeepers to stay away. This would not be the air force's first bit of freelance work. At the ceasefire talks last week in Sarajevo, Mr Vance asked the federal defence minister, General Veljko Kadijevic, why air-force jets continued to attack the Croatian town of Karlovac. The embarrassed general replied there was nothing he could do to stop them. Citing ill health, though perhaps suffering more from endless quarrels among his colleagues, he resigned on January 8th.
Despite the attack on the EC helicopter, on January 8th the UN Security Council voted to proceed with the first step of the peacekeeping plan--the dispatch of 50 UN observers to scout the terrain. They will find that rebellious air-force pilots are not the only ones with their own agenda. The Serb baron of the Krajina region in Croatia, Milan Babic, a dentist by profession, has rejected the UN plan, complaining that Serbia has betrayed him. It was Serb nationalists like Mr Babic who helped Mr Milosevic to power. Their plan to detach themselves from Croatia and declare an ""autonomous republic"" of encouragement from Serbia, plus arms and protection from the Serb-dominated federal army.
Now that Mr Milosevic wants these demons back in their bottles, they are reluctant to go. The military commander of Krajina says his men will not disarm and disband--the UN plan calls for them to do--until the Croatian National Guard gives up its arms. Serb guerrilla leaders operating in Slavonia, including the notorious ""Captain Arcan"" (wanted in Sweden for shooting his way out of a court where he was standing trial), have accepted the UN plan. But how long they will stay quiet is unsure. Captain Arcan, who when not fighting Croats runs a pastry shop and restaurant in Belgrade, has told his followers to keep their ammunition dry.
The discontent of the Serb barons in Croatia is not hard to understand. For several weeks pressure has been mounting on Mr Milosevic and the army's high command to end the war or at least take a long breather. Many young Serbs no longer sleep at home in Belgrade for fear of a call from the recruiting officer. Draft-dodging is rife. Desertion and refusal to move up to the front are common. In Mr Milosevic's home town of Pozarevac, recruits protested this week against the war in Croatia. Senior officers admit that morale in the regular army is so low that, to get anyone who will fight, they must call more and more on irregulars.
The army late last year ban running out of military targets to attack in Croatia. From the start Mr Milosevic and the high command realised that Zagreb was out of their reach. But in December they had to accept that central Slavonia was also beyond their grasp.
Serbia's international isolation is taking a toll. Germany is recognising Croatia and is pressing its partners in the EC to do likewise by January 15th--the deadline the Community has set itself for an answer to requests for recognition from Yugoslav republics meeting certain standards of statehood and good behaviour. Serbs exaggerate when talking about a Fourth Reich stretching from the Baltic to the Adriatic. But they are right that they have few friends in Germany and that Germany's voice in the Community is loud. A peacekeeping plan arranged by the UN, where the Serbs feel they have more friends, has obvious appeal.
The plan involves concessions from both sides. The federal army would leave three big Serb enclaves in Croatia--Krajina, Western Slavonia and Eastern Slavonia--and around 10,000 UN peacekeepers would take their place. The French, Dutch and Turks may supply men; the Germans, somewhat grumpily, money. Militias and guerrillas would be disarmed. Local police would be chosen according to the ethnic make-up of towns and villages before the fighting. The Croats would not automatically have full control of any land they had lost (about a third of Croatia by most reckoning), though the Croat president, Franjo Tudjman, says that Croatia aims to get back ""every square centimetre"".
If the scheme takes effect as planned, will Serbia's war have been in vain, as the angry barons of Krajina claim? The future of the Serb enclaves in Croatia is yet to be decided. So is the question of who, if anyone, inherits the Yugoslav state. As war aims, the Serbs hoped to expand their borders at Croatia's expense and, if not to hold the old Yugoslavia together, to lead a reduced one with the republics of Macedonia, Bosnia & Hercegovina, and Montenegro.
At the conference table the Croats are likelier to be tougher now than they were last year. If they detect Serbian weakness, Macedonia and Bosnia may go for full independence themselves. Could it be that all Mr Milosevic and the high command have done in six months of war is to demonstrate that, even in disintegrating Eastern Europe, aggression does not pay?"
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224159140/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/24?accountid=14657,"Fleeing in convoys of tractors or crammed on to ferry boats, most of Yugoslavia's refugees look, for a moment, like refugees the world over: in shock, bedraggled and miserable. But some flee in their Mercedes. There are no squalid tent cities. The fairly orderly absorption of well-fed Europeans does not match the apocalyptic television pictures from, say, Kurdistan or Ethiopia. But it is a human disaster all the same.
Yugoslavia's population is formally put at 24m. At the end of December local Red Cross societies had registered more than 600,000 refugees (technically, they are ""displaced persons"", because they are still within their country of origin). Just over half are in Croatia, mostly Croats who have fled the fighting there. The rest are mainly in Serbia and Bosnia.
Judith Kumin, the chief of mission for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Belgrade, reckons the true number of people displaced by the war could be as high as 1m. On top of those registered, she believes there may be another 20% unregistered. Several hundred thousand people have left the country to stay with friends or relations working abroad. On top of this are thousands who have fled the draft, the families of 36,000 Yugoslav army officers being moved from Croatia and Slovenia, 40,000 refugees in Hungary and thousands more in other neighbouring countries.
So far local government, Red Cross societies and other volunteer groups have coped admirably. Some 80% of the refugees have been housed with friends, family or with ordinary people who have opened their homes to take them in. In Croatia tourist hotels have been commandeered. Sports halls, weekend homes and monasteries are housing refugees. Croats and Serbs abroad have been raising money to help, and aid has come from the UNHCR, the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organisation and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy to Yugoslavia who arranged the latest ceasefire, has made it clear that he wants all the refugees to go home as soon as possible. But thousands of homes have been either destroyed or newly occupied. And refugees who say that until a year ago they did not even know that their neighbours were Serbs or Croats now insist they can never envisage living next to them again.
ICRC officials say they are now seeing increased numbers of well-off urban Serbs coming in from Croatia. On the other side, in areas of eastern Croatia, the local Serb authorities have banned the return of Croats to their homes and encouraged Serb refugees to move into them. Some observers mutter darkly about a Serbo-Croatian understanding to resettle refugees in a way that will facilitate a redrawing of frontiers.
In the meantime most of the refugees sit and wait. ""These people are educated and motivated,"" says one aid official. ""If they knew for sure that they would not be going home, they would get up now and start building new lives. The trouble is the uncertainty. They don't yet know if they have lost everything or whether they may be going back""."

Run by poets and sculptors, defended by young guardsmen eating grapes on top of tanks that did not work, it was hard to believe that things could turn really nasty. But on January 6th, after two weeks of fighting and over 100 deaths, Georgia's elected president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, fled a shell-shattered and burning parliament building in Tbilisi to take refuge in Armenia. The pair of rebel troop-leaders who took power are already falling out with their civilian allies.
Unlike troubles elsewhere in the ex-Soviet Union, Georgia's are not an inter-ethnic affair. Georgia's angry minorites--Abkhazians and Ossetians--live in outlying regions and have taken little part in Tbilisi's quarrels. Rather, the power struggle in the capital resembles a violent family row.
Mr Gamsakhurdia's chief supporters and opponents are all drawn from Tbilisi's close-knit intellectual elite (Georgia boasts the highest proportion of graduates of any ex-Soviet republic). Tengiz Sigua, a professor by trade and civilian leader of the opposition, was Mr Gamsakhurdia's prime minister until he resigned in protest at his president's muted reaction to last year's August putsch in Moscow. Tengiz Kitovani, one of the two rebel troop-leaders now in power, is a sculptor and went to school with Mr Gamsakhurdia, who is himself a translator of Baudelaire into Georgian (and the son of Georgia's best-known modern novelist).
The policies of Mr Gamsakhurdia and his opponents look similar too: both sides want diplomatic recognition from the West, both profess an urge to privatise land and attract foreign investment. It was Mr Gamsakhurdia's mishandling of his fellow Georgians that so riled the opposition.
Mr Gamsakhurdia won 87% of the vote in the presidential election last May. Flushed with success, he proceeded to rule like a dictator. Critics were arrested and opposition newspapers closed. In September government troops fired on anti-government demonstrators, wounding several.
Denied a legal voice, the opposition took to arms. This week's violence was the culmination of four months of riots, shoot-outs and demonstrations. The new leaders may yet prove as immoderate as their predecessor. On January 3rd and again on January 7th, rebel guards fired into crowds of demonstrators supporting Mr Gamsakhurdia, killing two of them.
Given time to settle down, the new government may do better than this. Mr Kitovani and fellow-rebel Djaba Ioselliani, an ex-convict and playwright, say they will hold new elections in April, and install Mr Sigua, a non-soldier, as president in the meantime. But tensions are already apparent. Mr Sigua wants to reconvene parliament and has called for national reconciliation. His military minders would rather keep more power to themselves and have vowed vengeance on Mr Gamsakhurdia. However, in a conciliatory gesture towards the South Ossetians, with whom Mr Gamsakhurdia had been at war for months, the new rebel bosses of Tbilisi this week released one of the South Ossetian leaders held by the Georgian KGB.
Georgia's troubles may not be over yet. Fighting may spread to the rural provinces, where Mr Gamsakhurdia enjoys his strongest support. Shootings have already been reported in Kutaisi, a small city in western Georgia. In interviews from his Armenian hide-out, Mr Gamsakhurdia has vowed to try to regain power.
In part in an attempt to head off a new round of shooting, in part no doubt in search of a new job after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Edward Shevardnadze, Georgia's best-known son after Stalin, has offered his services in rebuilding democracy there. As a respected former Soviet foreign minister, Mr Shevardnadze could win friends for Georgia abroad. But as former Communist Party boss in the 1970s, he may have too many enemies at home."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224140661/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/26?accountid=14657,"In the bad old Brezhnev days, Vassily Aksenov, an anti-establishment writer, wrote a futuristic novel on the premise that the White Russians had held on to the Crimea during the revolution and transformed it into a consumer paradise, a sort of Soviet Taiwan. Today, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the sunny Black Sea peninsula is indeed an enclave, but of the opposite variety. The Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic--as it is still called--is a bastion of Soviet-style communism.
Monumental statues of Lenin tower over the central squares of Crimean cities. Huge propaganda hoardings declare that ""Communism is the path to a bright future"". In the local parliament the (ex-)Communist majority is opposed by fewer than two dozen democrats.
One reason that the old order dies hard on this lovely bit of Black Sea coast is that the Crimea was one of the best exemplars of a bad system. With its luxury dachas on the outskirts of Yalta and its naval base in Sebastopol, the Crimea played host to the two most privileged classes in the Soviet system: the Communist Party nomenklatura and the armed forces. While the rest of the Soviet Union grew desperate and disorderly, Crimean Communists remained relatively well supplied and well disciplined.
Now that the Soviet Union's flag has been lowered, its Crimean flagship is suffering an acute identity crisis. Crimeans are even unsure about which country they belong to. Under central Soviet rule, this question was so immaterial that in 1954 the Crimea was casually transferred from Russia to Ukraine as a ""gift"" to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the ""fraternal union"" of the Ukrainian and Russian people. Suddenly the Crimea must choose between Ukraine and Russia, and risks becoming a flash-point for the conflict between the two Slav giants.
Although Russians outnumber Ukrainians in the region, just over half of Crimeans voted yes to Ukrainian independence in the referendum last December. Still, most Crimeans' willingness to live in independent Ukraine is grudging and conditional. Their hope is that Ukraine will climb out of the economic slump more quickly than Russia. Their fear is that Ukrainian independence will mean Ukrainianisation in the Crimea, which does not today have a single Ukrainian school or newspaper.
Russia could revive claims on the Crimea if the Russian economy continues to deteriorate and its government takes refuge in nationalism. Ukrainian politicians, who categorically reject any border changes, have three trump cards.
CRIMEA OF PASSION
First, the Crimea borders only on Ukraine, from which it gets most of its water and 80% of its electricity; Ukrainian leaders have hinted that they would retaliate against Crimean secession with an economic blockade. Second, the armed forces appear to side with Ukraine: 72% of the Black Sea fleet voted for Ukrainian independence. (But Ukraine's claim to the fleet, and its attempt to impose a loyalty oath, are fiercely resisted by Russia, which says the fleet is part of the strategic forces that the Commonwealth of Independent States has agreed should remain under unified command.)
Third, in a stunning shift of historical alliances, Ukraine is playing the Tatars against the Russians. It was in part the Tatar threat that drove Ukraine to form its first and fatal union with Russia. But today Ukraine strongly backs the Tatars' efforts to return to the Crimea, from which Stalin expelled them in 1944 for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. In exchange, the highly organised Crimean Tatar community, which grows daily as Tatars flow in from Central Asia and erect makeshift homes, opposes calls to join Russia.
The political tussle distracts from the Crimea's other malaise--its creaky command economy. The Crimea is poised to convert its Communist Party dachas into hotels in a bid to replace Yugoslavia as the bargain-hunter's European sunspot. But the ideological reflexes of Crimean officialdom--including gut hostility to private property--have limited foreign investment; only one deal was concluded in 1991.
Innovation is not exactly a catch-word in conservative Crimea, but the local nomenklatura does have a genius for finding new justification for old mechanisms of control. Take Sebastopol. Under Brezhnev, Sebastopol was made a closed city to protect the military secrets of the Black Sea fleet. City fathers admit there is no longer a security threat, but say Sebastopol could remain closed for another 12 months. After all, there is a water shortage."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224162530/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/27?accountid=14657,"Legend has it that witches weave spells of rare power atop the Brocken, Saxony-Anhalt's highest mountain. For the superstitious, that helps explain a lot about the state, cursed with most of the problems facing other parts of eastern Germany plus some all of its own. If unity can be made to work in Saxony-Anhalt, Wessis (western Germans) say grimly, it will work anywhere.
The problems start with history. Other eastern Germans like the Saxons and Brandenburgers have an inbred sense of regional identity which even the communists, who replaced the old Lander with ""administrative districts"", failed to destroy. Saxony-Anhalt, on the other hand, was formed only in 1945 from two rival areas. It was abolished in 1952, then reborn along with the rest of the eastern Lander in 1990.
True, there is a strong sense of cultural tradition. Luther and Nietzsche, Handel and Telemann were born in what is now Saxony-Anhalt. Dessau became home to the Bauhaus school of architects and artists in the 1920s. But the old feuds smoulder on. Farmers in the north groan about the filthy industry in the south; thousand-year-old Halle has still not forgiven Magdeburg for winning the battle to become state capital.
The state can ill afford to be divided against itself. Even by East German standards, industry is a wreck and pollution shocking. Here was once the sulphurous heart of the East German chemical industry. In Leuna and Bitterfeld eyes quickly smart and throats go dry from the fumes; in Wolfen houses back on to a ""Silver Lake"" of lead, zinc and other toxic waste. Experts reckon a modernised core of the industry can survive, pointing to the west German chemicals giant Bayer, which aims to invest DM500m ($320m) in Bitterfeld. Some even claim the area can become Germany's headquarters for green technology. But demolition and clean-up will cost billions of D-marks.
As factories close, the output of muck falls; but that is small comfort for the 29% of the labour force out of work or on short time. Farmers, mainly organised in co-operatives, struggle with a deluge of new legal problems and EC regulations; few can raise the money (up to DM1m) needed to set up on their own. Western Germans and even a few Dutch are moving on to the best plots.
The state is run by a coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats (liberals). Gerd Gies, a mournful-looking premier, resigned in the summer after running afoul of his own party. Since then the deputy premier and the agriculture minister have stepped down too, after it emerged that both had worked for the Stasi, the East German secret police. That was grim confirmation to many in the state who complain that a lot of ex-Stasi people still hold top jobs--in business as well as politics.
THE BEST FROM THE WEST
Is there any good news for the 3m Saxon-Anhalters? A bit. They are getting a lot of help from the west: not just money, but above-average numbers of politicians and advisers. The locals are not always keen on that, but most know that the help is needed.
The long list of western imports stretches right up to Werner Munch, the new Christian Democratic premier who has raised spirits, and trodden on a few toes, since taking over in July from the gloomy Mr Gies. Mr Munch's furious work tempo and conspicuous energy--hand-shaking, back-slapping, ""light at the end of the tunnel"" optimism--contrast oddly with his former lowish profile in the west. He is one example from many of a Wessi who has really shone only after going east.
Something of the same goes for Horst Rehberger, a Free Democrat who sprang from relative obscurity in the Saarland to take over the economics ministry. He is winning praise for putting public money to work quickly (incentives for around 1,000 investment projects worth close to DM8 billion were approved in 1991) and for encouraging small firms, now springing up at the rate of about 3,000 a month. Foreign investors, headed by the French, have been tempted in, not least by incentives which can cover over half the investment cost.
Some DM700m was spent in 1991 alone to revamp the corrugated roads, another DM500m to promote tourism. Tourism is already a big earner in the area of the Harz mountains, noted for its half-timbered houses and (Saxony-Anhalt is always good for a surprise) its canary breeders.
The impact of this huge injection of money is already obvious. Old town centres are being cleaned up, churches and castles restored, sites cleared for new industrial parks. The trouble is that financing needs are even greater than forecast and tax revenue much less. Hitherto, Saxony-Anhalt has kept its borrowing relatively low and Mr Munch has chided eastern colleagues who run whining to the federal government for more money. His reluctant admission that more will be needed is one of the surest signs yet that, despite disclaimers in Bonn, the overall unity bill will not be paid without another rise in federal taxes.
Saxon-Anhalters joke that, if all else fails, aid will eventually come from the Emperor Barbarossa, sleeping in his cave in the Kyffhauser mountains to the south. Once every 1,000 years Barbarossa is supposed to rise and bring the Germans better times.
There are just two centuries to wait."

Almost $800m is being spent to stage the games. Another $800m has been spent on new access roads. Organisers hope the games will be the grandest yet. They may be. But once the party is over, the region will be left with a nasty financial hangover.
Unlike previous host cities such as Calgary and Sarajevo, this year's host, Albertville, is an unimpressive blue-collar sub-prefecture of only 18,000 people. It is not even a resort town. Almost all the events will be held in 13 Alpine villages spread over 2,000 square kilometres (750 square miles). Each village lobbied hard for its part of the Olympic pie. Result: no fewer than five skating rinks have been built, and four of the 13 villages are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.
The gold medal for spending goes to Brides-les-Bains (population 600). It has paid more than $100m for, among other things, a glass-and-steel casino and town hall. The municipal deficit now stands at more than $10m. Another giant folly took place at Pralognon-la-Vanoise (population 650). It contributed to the building of a $6m ice-rink in the hope of holding a glamorous event such as hockey or figure skating. Instead, it was awarded curling, which is not even an official Olympic sport. After locals found out that it costs almost $400 a day to keep the ice in the arena frozen, they took the first opportunity to vote the old local administration out of office.
Instead of attracting visitors, the games seem to have scared them away. Various resorts report that bookings for February are down by at least 25% on normal years. Few skiers, it seems, want the hassle and high prices of the Olympics. Ski resorts in the Pyrenees are promoting themselves as a tranquil alternative.
One undisputed bonus from the games is a new four-lane motorway built into the heart of Savoy (though it did take the best part of two days to unblock the road after blizzards before Christmas). This was what originally induced the locals to bid for the Olympics. The organisers say the games remain a great chance for the region to publicise itself: some 2 billion television viewers are expected to tune in. Besides, with the exception of those strains on municipal finances, the budget for the games is balanced. Corporate sponsors are praised for picking up much of the bill.
But of the 12 most generous sponsors, more than half are state-controlled companies, including Renault, Thomson and France Telecom. True, foreign companies such as Coca-Cola and IBM have also paid heftily for the right to advertise themselves as ""official"" sponsors. CBS, an American television network, has paid $243m for coverage rights. No one ever said that Olympian folly was only French."

On January 9th he at last achieved his long-standing goal of becoming party leader. But Michel Rocard, another former prime minister and presidential hopeful, may yet reap the greater benefit from a behind-the-scenes deal to clinch Mr Fabius's nomination.
Dissatisfaction with the outgoing party leader, Pierre Mauroy (another former prime minister), had been mounting for some time. In his 3-1/2 years in the job, the affable mayor of Lille had failed to stop the wrangling between the three main party factions (led by Messrs Fabius, Rocard and Lionel Jospin) or to stem the party's decline. Voting intentions for the Socialists have slumped to a mere 21%.
So long as Mr Mauroy could continue to play one faction off against another, he was safe. But his attempts to win party approval for the reintroduction of proportional representation (in accordance with President Mitterrand's wishes) provoked widespread hostility and prompted the formation of an unexpected alliance between Mr Rocard and Mr Fabius. Mr Mauroy felt it was time to go, and named Mr Fabius, formerly president of the National Assembly, as the man ""best-placed"" to hold the party together.
Realising he could do little to stop the move, short of tearing the party further apart, Mr Rocard decided to give Mr Fabius his support. But only on certain conditions: reform of the party statutes, no major change of the electoral system, and fairer distribution of party posts between factions. All this was designed to strengthen his own power base and to impede the progress of the man he now considers his most dangerous rival--Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission and the new darling of the French left.
Mr Rocard knows he is taking a gamble. Mr Fabius is still Mr Mitterrand's personal favourite as his successor. As party leader, Mr Fabius will be in an excellent position to gear the Socialist machine to his own presidential ambitions. But he is still only 45, and at present not terribly popular with the voters. So Mr Rocard feels Mr Fabius can probably be counted out of the next presidential race, due in 1995.
Contrary to some speculation, Mr Rocard has made no explicit deal with Mr Fabius over his selection as the Socialist Party's next presidential candidate: he knows that such deals are not worth the paper they are written on. He must nevertheless have been gratified to hear Mr Mauroy, in his resignation speech, describe him as already the party's ""virtual candidate"". Mr Mitterrand, whose antipathy to Mr Rocard knows few bounds, will not have been amused. But a lame-duck president whose popularity ratings are at a record low (despite a slight rise shown by one poll after the Maastricht summit) cannot continue to impose his will on the party he founded 20 years ago."

And they should do the job for a year instead of the present six months. This proposal comes from Klaus Hansch, a German socialist and member of the European Parliament's committee on institutional affairs.
Mr Hansch's ideas are part of a growing debate about the way the EC will need to adapt its institutions to cope with the expansion of the club to 20 or more members. They are bound to be rejected by the Community's smaller members (including Portugal, which began its six months as president on January 1st). Doomed or not, the proposal also reflects a rising dissatisfaction with the way the Community handles its presidency.
At present, the Twelve follow each other in alphabetical order for a six-month stint. The EC is not alone in letting its members take turns to sit in the chair. The United Nations Security Council, NATO, the Council of Europe and others do the same. But there the presidency's job carries formal duties, not real power.
So it used to be with the Community. But the role of its presidency has expanded with the EC's influence. The presidency sets the Community's agenda, chooses priorities, brokers compromises and takes charge of international activities, such as peacemaking in Yugoslavia.
Governments also exploit their stint as president for parochial purposes. The Dutch dragged unwilling EC ambassadors from Brussels to Curacao in the Dutch Antilles for a wasted week last September to honour a pledge made to local politicians there. John Major has chosen Edinburgh for Britain's summit next December to give a boost to the gloomy electoral prospects of Scotland's Conservatives.
The quick rotation, the parochialism and the pretence that tiny Luxembourg, despite workmanlike performances, has the same world standing as EC president as, say, Germany cause problems of continuity and credibility. The EC has tried to counter these, in foreign policy, by creating the troika, a collective leadership consisting of the current president, its immediate predecessor and its direct successor. At the moment the three foreign ministers forming the troika are Portugal's Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Holland's Hans van den Broek and Britain's Douglas Hurd. The troika ensures a minimum of continuity. Usually one of the big EC countries is part of the troika, with a correspondingly weighty influence. The past six months were an exception: the three were Holland, Luxembourg and Portugal.
Mr Hansch's formula is one way to avoid these problems in future. But there are alternatives. The French would like an EC president elected by universal suffrage throughout the Community. But such a leader would be a figurehead. Indeed, any formula to take the presidency out of governments' hands would strengthen the power of the Brussels bureaucracy that supports the presidency. Other ideas for greater continuity, like doubling the duration of each presidency from six to 12 months, would still leave small countries in charge for seven years out of 12.
Hence an idea being floated in Brussels to regionalise the presidency. The attractiveness of this formula would increase as EC membership grew. Like Mr Hansch's proposal, it would avoid a presidency rotating round 20 or more countries. But it would also give the smaller countries a joint period in the chair.
Germany, France, Britain and Italy would still qualify for their own presidencies. The others would share. A combined presidency for the three Benelux countries would be an obvious option. Spain and Portugal could have an Iberian presidency. Denmark could join a Scandinavian presidency if Sweden, Finland and possibly Norway become EC members. There could eventually be a Slav presidency once Poland and Czechoslovakia are in, not to mention the Austro-Hungarian possibility. The idea of a joint Balkan presidency stretches credulity in present circumstances."

It ended this week with John Major and Neil Kinnock both posing for the cameras and issuing contemptuous assaults on one another's policies and record. The prime minister was photographed in a battle tank. The Labour leader held what was billed as his shadow cabinet's last all-day meeting in opposition. The Liberal Democrats' leader, Paddy Ashdown, tried to appear above it all.
Nobody expects the election to come before a March budget; and many look to April or May. So why did the Tories decide to attack Labour so early over its tax plans--by general consent, its weakest flank? Normally, parties keep back their best ammunition until the three-week campaign proper, to avoid boring voters and allowing the other side to stiffen its defences.
Some Labour MPS are talking again about a snap election. More likely, Mr Major has told his party chairman, Chris Patten, that he wants to keep open the option of holding an election before April. To do that, the Tories must claw back Labour's small but persistent poll lead within a few weeks, then reverse it and hold that reverse.
How will voters be able to spot the politicians' untruths and propaganda from the tough questions that deserve answers? Take the recession. Labour blames it on Mr Major, and he blames Abroad. There is some truth in each version. Wise Britons will ask, instead, about the future. Labour and the Liberal Democrats will try to keep the economic argument on the need for greater investment in technology and in education and training. The Tories would prefer the economic debate to be largely about personal taxes. That way, ministers can spend as little time as possible trying to defend their patchy economic record, and as much reinforcing voters' fears about their current family budgets. The Tories will probably win this tussle: most people are more interested in their tax bands than in the long-term effects of higher school spending.
On tax, claims and counter-claims are complicated and need to be carefully sifted (see box on next page); but the worst fibs are clear. (Box omitted) This week's Tory allegation that Labour secretly intends to raise the basic rate of income tax by 10p in the pound, to finance a L35 billion ($65 billion) spending spree, is ludicrous. The Tories will also try to persuade voters that ""taxes"" means income taxes. But indirect taxes, particularly VAT, have risen steeply under the Tories--as has the total tax-take by government.
Labour's shadow chancellor, John Smith, has made it clear that he promises only to spend L4.3 billion a year on higher pensions and higher child benefits. Almost everything else must wait for economic growth. And any party which lied about its intention not to raise the basic rate, then pounced in power, would be finished.
So has poor Labour been viciously traduced? Not really. It has tried to respond to its familiar dilemma--of wanting to be a high-spending party without being a high-taxing one--by splitting itself in two. Mr Smith reassures the City and voters generally about his tax plans. But shadow spending ministers pander to health workers, teachers and the low-paid with a different tune. By harping on ""Tory underfunding"", they deliberately create the impression that a Labour government would spend far more. Yet unless taxes were raised substantially, it could not.
Until Labour spokesmen say clearly and publicly that they do not intend to reverse ""Tory spending cuts"" for years, their anguish over Tory untruths about their tax plans will be only half-convincing. They cannot have it both ways. Voters who are worried either about declining public services or about the effect of higher spending on their wallets should watch Labour statements about the party's precise spending plans for the health service, education, infrastructure and training. There will be generous-sounding waffle, but few promises.
Although tax and public spending will be the main battle-ground, the smoke of political deceit will hang thickly elsewhere, too. The Tory charge that Neil Kinnock is not fit to be prime minister is a matter of opinion--but charges that he is not intelligent enough, or not patriotic enough, are disgraceful. On the other hand, the Labour allegation that Mr Major intends to privatise the national health service is a deliberate untruth. Alert voters should ignore both lies, and look askance at those who spout them.
Other campaigns now being prepared will rely more on hyperbole than straight whoppers. Conservative Central Office is especially fond of this tactic. Exaggerating its trade-union links, the Tories will accuse Labour of taking orders from union bosses and will talk of the party as ""a wholly-owned subsidiary"" of the unions. Labour's minimum-wage proposals, which most economists agree would be likely to stifle job creation, will be cast as the automatic trigger for a huge jump in unemployment. Labour's vague plans to spend less on defence will be castigated for ""leaving Britain defenceless"". And so on.
There will be two more general lines of attack between the two main parties. Labour will argue that Mr Major is a weak leader who has, for instance, failed to be a big influence in Europe because he is scared stiff of his Thatcherite backbenchers. In fact, though he has moved cautiously, Mr Major has quite clearly taken his party towards the European mainstream; if re-elected, he would certainly not leave Britain adrift from the continent. While no visionary, he has proved himself calmly competent.
The Tories will argue that Labour has changed on so many things (Europe, defence, trade-union reform) that it cannot be trusted on anything--Conservative Central Office has been preparing lists of old Kinnock quotations. But, like Labour over tax and spending, the Tories want to have it both ways: where Labour has not changed, it will be stigmatised as ""outdated""; where it has, as ""unprincipled"". And the Liberal Democrats? Their big fib is that they are interested only in better government through voting reform (rather than power for themselves). They pretend to be above it all, but are not. Nor, sadly, is anyone else."

Will Labour, as the Tories claim, turn Britain into a high-tax country once again?
The government's claim that Labour would raise the basic rate of income tax from 25% to 35%, in order to pay for its spending plans, is plain silly. But Labour is committed to two big changes:
* It will increase the top rate of income tax from 40% to 50%. But at what level of income would the top rate start to apply? ""Well over L30,000 ($56,100)"", according to Neil Kinnock.
* It will abolish the upper ceiling on employees' national insurance contributions (NICS). At present, the 9% rate of NICS is not payable by employees on annual earnings of more than L20,280. This gives rise to a bizarre anomaly: someone on L20,000 pays tax at a marginal rate (taking income tax plus NICS) of 34%, but someone on L21,000 faces a marginal rate of just 25%. Under Labour's plan, for every L100 earned over L20,280 an extra L9 will be deducted. This will lift the highest possible marginal rate of tax to 59%.
If Labour wins the election, many higher-paid workers could be cancelling their second holiday in 1993. The calculations in the table assume that Labour brings in the 50% rate on taxable income above L30,000 (equivalent to gross income of L35,015 for a married man) and that the 40% rate remains as an intermediate band for taxable income under L30,000 but over L23,700. It would mean that a married man with a gross income of L40,000 would face an increase in his tax bill of L2,274 (L1,775 NICS and L499 income tax). The managing director on L100,000 would be L13,674 out of pocket; his total loss could be greater still, as Labour has said that it will also extend NICS to investment income and will restrict tax relief on pensions to the basic rate.
Labour talks of taxing the rich more heavily in order to help the poor. Yet a family on L30,000 (roughly 1-3/4 times average earnings) and struggling to pay a mortgage would hardly call itself ""rich"". Some 4m workers (16% of all taxpayers), who earn more than L20,280, would be hit by higher NICS. Around 1m taxpayers are on more than L35,000, and so would face the 59% rate. The two measures would together yield the Treasury under Labour an extra L4 billion or so a year.
In purely economic terms, the case for abolishing the NIC ceiling is stronger. The current NIC system, with its sudden dip in marginal-tax rates on middle incomes, is bizarre. But why combine this reform with an increase in top income-tax rates, when other countries are cutting taxes?
How would British executives' tax bills compare with those abroad under Labour's proposals? At 59%, Britain would impose on its highest earners the second-highest (behind Japan) marginal income-tax rate of the seven big industrial economies. More significantly, though, the top rate would bite at a much lower level of income than elsewhere: for those on a L50,000 salary (see chart), Britain would carry the highest rate. (Chart omitted)
Britain's threshold for the top rate of income tax has fallen steadily in real terms over the past three decades. In 1961 a married man had to earn the equivalent in today's prices of more than L190,000 before he reached the top rate of income tax (then 88.75%); today the 40% rate is payable above L28,715. This is little more than 1-1/2 times average earnings, compared with thresholds for top tax rates of four times average earnings in America and more than six times in Japan, Germany and France.
Because of this, British executives already pay more tax than most of their foreign counterparts. Under Labour they would have by far the highest average tax rate. The chart, based on figures compiled for The Economist by Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, compares across seven countries the income tax (including social-security contributions) paid by a married man on the equivalent of L50,000, as a percentage of his income. Under a Labour government, a British executive would hand 41% of his income to the tax man (up from 32% now)--more than in any other country. Yet salaries are lower in Britain than in continental Europe and America. It could be boom times again for the tax-avoidance merchants."

So it is odd that British Steel's decision to make 1,200 men redundant at the Ravenscraig steel complex in west Scotland should have created a special furore. Odd, that is, to those unschooled in the old-fashioned socialism that rules in west Scotland.
The Labour Party and the Scottish Nationalists naturally denounced the decision. But so did the Conservative secretary of state for Scotland, Ian Lang, who said the decision was ""hugely disappointing"". Even John Major said the decision was a matter of ""very great regret"". And Ian Livingston, a solicitor who is chairman of the Lanarkshire Development Agency, said that local people were entitled to feel ""resentment and anger at this betrayal"". Strong stuff.
In fact, British Steel is giving up steelmaking at Ravenscraig for a simple reason: it is unprofitable, and getting more so. Closure marks British Steel's determination to stay competitive. Helping companies do that is what modern Tory governments are supposed to be about.
In the six months to September 30th, British Steel's pre-tax profits slumped to L19m ($32m) from L307m; the firm is expected to show a loss of up to L100m for its full year to March. Sales are currently running at about 14% down on the peak levels of two years ago, and prices since then have fallen roughly 20%. By closing Ravenscraig and concentrating steelmaking at its two modern plants in south Wales, the company could save L40m a year.
A decade ago British Steel was a nationalised industry. Its workforce was bigger by 200,000 than it is today, but the company was costing the taxpayer L4m a day. Privatised, it became one of the world's top steelmakers: profits reached L733m in 1989-90. But if it is to stay in business, when the world is loaded down with cheap steel, it has to continue to make tough, commercial decisions. Admittedly, back in 1987 British Steel promised to keep Ravenscraig open until 1994 ""subject to commercial requirements"". But this did not mean ""regardless of commercial requirements"".
The decision to build a steel plant in Ravenscraig was taken by Harold Macmillan's government in 1958, which insisted that the industry build two new plants: one in Scotland and one in south Wales. This was done in the name of ""regional planning"". But it was industrial nonsense; only one new plant was needed.
The Ravenscraig site did have one advantage: it was on a coalfield close to iron-ore deposits. But both the coal and the ore have long since gone. And as the dream of a Scottish car industry has faded, so have the chances of any local demand for steel.
The government has now declared that north Lanarkshire will be an enterprise zone, if the EC agrees. It will get L50m in tax-breaks and extra public spending over the next decade, on top of a L40m bonus that Mr Major has already promised for the next two years. Considering that unemployment in Lanarkshire, at 11.7%, is only a few points above the national average, that might seem generous. Few in Scotland will think so."

On January 2nd it at last received such an application--from US Sprint, America's third-largest international carrier.
Sprint wants to build a nationwide trunk network. To do so, it plans to lay fibre-optic cables along the tow-paths of the country's canals. These are owned by the newly privatised British Waterways; it will spend the money it earns from the project on making its canals more attractive to holiday-makers. Building the network will cost about L200m ($370m). Sprint is also talking to other utilities with similarly useful rights-of-way.
Initially, Sprint intends to offer only private lines that will connect, say, the scattered subsidiaries of a big company. If that goes well, the firm will launch a fully switched public service, like the one Mercury operates today. Even then, Sprint wants to sign up only lucrative, overseas-calling business customers. Low-volume residential callers need not apply.
Can the government's blessing be taken for granted? Last year it said it was keen to issue domestic licences, but was unlikely to grant new international ones ""in the short term"". Sprint's chairman, Bill Esrey, is adamant that unless he gets permission to carry international calls he will cancel the whole project. ""We're looking at both combined; I don't think either would stand on its own,"" he says. Like most of the rest of the industry, Sprint believes that multinationals would like to be able to buy all their telephone services from one of perhaps five competing world-wide carriers. To rank as one of these, Sprint needs to be able to carry calls in and out of America, Europe and Asia. It has a big American base; if granted a British licence it can set about building a complementary European one.
What Sprint should worry about most is not a grumpy DTI, but a new government. Labour has not yet said much about telecoms policy; but a Labour government would go slower on deregulation than the Tories. Labour ministers would probably prefer to see BT spending its hefty profits on cheaper calls for the poor than on fighting off competition for business customers. If that required the government to protect it from competitors like Sprint--and America's other big telecoms companies, which seem likely to want to follow in its path--then Labour ministers might be tempted to strike some kind of deal. No doubt BT, another aspiring world-wide carrier, would be ready with a plausible commercial pretext.
So unless Sprint can get its licence signed and sealed before the election, it may have missed the barge. Timing is tight. In the past 11 months the DTI has received 18 telecoms-licence applications, all for far smaller projects. So far, only one has been awarded."

His performances this week, on Labour's industry-programme launch and over the announcement that British Steel intends to shut down Scotland's last steel plant, were small classics of their kind.
Many urgent actions were demanded; new (in fact, repackaged) initiatives announced; ministers accused of neglect and complacency; Scots told they were ""right to be bitter"". In private a thoughtful and entertaining companion, his public persona is dour. He has not made his way in politics by being a cheerer-upper.
The seriousness, the professionalism and the caution have made Mr Brown enemies in his own party, who read it all as evidence of a frighteningly single-minded personal ambition. He is accused of being excessively aware of media relations, insufficiently interested in taking risks or toying with new thoughts. Unlike other Labour high-fliers--such as Bryan Gould, Robin Cook and John Prescotte--he has never been cold-shouldered by the Kinnock leadership. He has never shivered in the chill of Labour establishment disapproval; but nor has he had to endure any serious press hostility. For anti-Kinnockites, Mr Brown is the perfect exemplar of the shallowing of socialism.
Politics is a jealous profession, and many Brown-knockers are simply green from their scalps to their toenails. Mr Brown fails to see the careerist when he stares in the mirror. In his view, it is simply a matter of getting on with the job, trying to get Labour elected, and ignoring the bitching. He is not a good gossip.
Yet there is a paradox in Mr Brown's politics that deserves teasing out, because it has wider implications for Labour's rhetoric. Like John Smith, he is useful to Labour in the south of England precisely because he sounds so deeply serious, so cautious, so relentlessly unvisionary. If the Conservatives, in a moment of lunacy, put up a poster of Messrs Smith and Brown, with the caption ""Can you trust them?"", the average passer-by would say yes. For a party so recently derided as the preserve of woolly-minded dingbats, the dull ties and middle-class Scottish voices are invaluable.
Journalists, in their own way, have contributed to the picture. They have learned to go to Mr Brown for crisp quotes, anti-government numeracy, immediate reactions. When he launches into yet another speech about industrial competitiveness, skills, partnerships for prosperity and so on, they know the subplot. Worthy. Sensible. Lots of figures. Don't need to check them because they probably add up. This is not so dissimilar to the man described by hostile Labour witnesses: two profiles, same face.
The only problem is that Mr Brown is someone else entirely. He is a raving romantic. He is fuelled by a belief in community, helping one's neighbours. The son of a Church of Scotland minister, he is a bit of a moralist, an avoider of conspicuous consumption, and a bookish idealist. Underneath all the technocratic whizz-speak are old-fashioned dreams.
Back home, one of Mr Brown's friends is a Scottish working-class novelist, William McIlvanney, who, in a recent book, attacked the whole idea of measuring people (as the conventional political culture tends to do) by their economic contribution to society or their material wealth: ""You want a measurement of people? Then, if you wish to remain Scottish, here it is. You will measure them by the extent of their understanding, by the width of their compassion, by the depth of their concern and by the size of their humanity. There's a real system for you.""
Mr Brown would agree with that anti-materialist manifesto. So would Mr Smith and Mr Kinnock. But--and here is the central paradox--they have become fluent in a political language which stresses efficiency, competence, costings, competitiveness and caution, to the extent of squeezing out the old language of humanist idealism they went into politics to proclaim. They may still feel like dreamers, but they have learnt to talk like accountants. Small wonder if they are then mistaken for careerists.
In the past few months, the mood in the Labour leadership seems to have been be changing. Mr Kinnock is more relaxed than he has been for years. Enthusiasm for a bit more risk-taking, and a more colourful rhetoric, is spreading through the shadow cabinet. Mr Brown himself plans a speech soon about constitutional reforms, Europe, a Scottish parliament and new bulwarks of rights for the citizen.
He is more than capable of making that a thoughtful, cautious occasion which is neither moving nor provocative, but which places him neatly in the mainstream of developing Labour ideas on these matters. (Mr Brown tends to be at the party's centre of gravity--and gravity is the word--on most issues.) But should he aim higher? He needs to excite, just as Labour itself does.
The problem of respectability smothering vision is Labour's problem, quite as much as it is his. The party is close to beating the Tories, or at least to getting a hung parliament. And Mr Brown can take some of the credit for that. But the party has failed so far to spark the kind of popular enthusiasm that could bring about a majority Labour government. He must take some of the blame for that.
Voters are still unlikely to believe that socialists (even reformed ones, in white shirts) are more calmly competent that Tories--recession or not. Labour cannot soothe its way into power: the Tory warning of higher taxes will see to that. Labour's technological vision of a higher-investment economy will not have them marching on the streets, either. Unless Labour leaders like Mr Brown let their real feelings and true motivations shine through--until they start sounding angry about poverty and unemployment, for instance--they will fail to set this election alight. It will take such fire to show up John Major's lack of it."

By assiduously learning from, and then surpassing, established American and European firms in industry after industry, Japanese companies have earned an intimidating reputation. Now that reputation is casting a long shadow over scores of troubled computer-makers. When a lumbering IBM announced a drastic reorganisation and thousands of job cuts in November, industry pundits held up Fujitsu, Japan's biggest computer company, as a model of the flexible, diversified computer-maker of the future. In Europe, computer firms awash in red ink spent much of 1991 citing the Japanese threat in their pleas for government support.
It is always a mistake to underestimate competitors. But it may be just as big a mistake to fear them unnecessarily. While profits have fallen at western companies, Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi have suffered too. Mostly due to overcapacity in their semiconductor businesses, the three firms' profits all plummeted in the latest half-year: Fujitsu's by 60%, NEC's by 38% and Hitachi's by 20%. More important, Japanese computer companies have spent years trying to crack American and European markets, with little success.
Unlike their counterparts in the rest of the electronics industry, Japan's computer companies are conspicuous abroad mainly by their absence. The big three, Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi, hold three-quarters of the Japanese market between them, but only 3% of computer markets in the rest of the world. Unlike the biggest American companies, which operate globally, not one makes even a third of its sales abroad--indeed, sales outside Japan account for only 12% of NEC's computer revenues and 18% of Hitachi's. Even Fujitsu, the most aggressive overseas, still has only 29% of its computer sales in foreign markets. That compares with the 74% of Sony's sales which were made abroad in 1991, and 46% of Toyota's.
One reason that Japanese computer makers may not have succeeded abroad as well as their brethren in consumer electronics and cars is that, until recently, foreign computer buyers rarely bought primarily on price. Low-cost, high-quality manufacturing was less important than the latest technology, and than compatibility with existing systems and software. This is especially true of big corporate customers, who have accounted for the bulk of sales everywhere. The Japanese have yet to match many western rivals in either software or service.
Again, in contrast to other industries where Japan beats the world, the Japanese home market for computers is remarkably underdeveloped. Oddly for a gadget-happy nation, Japanese computer-users buy in old-fashioned ways. Mainframes built to idiosyncratic proprietary standards are still more popular than smaller, better-value, standardised machines. Expensive customised software still outsells cheaper off-the-shelf packages, and the work of writing customised software is still mostly done by computer manufacturers, rather than by specialist software firms. Personal computers cost 20% more than in America, and far fewer office workers have them.
Though the slow pace of change in Japan has given the Japanese computer-makers more time to make fat profits out of their proprietary machines, it has also made them late in tackling industry-wide problems. Under pressure from more knowledgeable and demanding customers, American and European firms have already accepted, albeit reluctantly, the inevitability of ""open"" standards, which are supposed to allow customers to link bits of equipment and software from various suppliers. Japanese computer makers still talk about supporting their own proprietary standards to the last. ""As long as one customer exists, we will never abandon him. Even if it is unprofitable, we would never do that,"" says Michio Naruto, a top manager at Fujitsu. Gallant stuff, but the heavy cost, both in extra research spending and in confusing product-offerings, of supporting lots of standards simultaneously has badly damaged any western firm that has tried it.
On top of a relatively unsophisticated home market, the three biggest Japanese computer firms also have managerial problems. As with IBM, layers of slow-moving bureaucracy have slowed decision-making and new product introductions at all three. In June 1989 Toshiba, accustomed to the faster-moving consumer-electronics market, stole a march on Japan's three biggest computer makers when it introduced the first mass-market lap-top computer, which was also a hit abroad. NEC's equivalent came out a disappointing five months later.
By reorganising into divisions defined by customer, rather than technology type, NEC, Japan's biggest personal-computer maker, hopes to spot such hot new ideas more quickly next time around. This is a move already made by many western companies. Fujitsu is undertaking a similar shake-up. Tadashi Sekizawa, Fujitsu's president, admits his firm is suffering from ""big-company disease"".
With competition fierce at home and many of the computer industry's snazziest ideas coming from abroad, Japan's computer makers are as determined as ever to break out of their home market. In the past they have pursued expansion abroad, as they have at home, through internal growth, usually avoiding big acquisitions. Apart from Hitachi's $386m purchase in 1989 of 80% of National Semiconductor's service and software business, neither Hitachi nor NEC has made a big acquisition for years. That may be about to change, if only because the strategy of internal growth has failed to work for the computer makers the way it did for car and consumer-electronics companies. ""We have come to the limit of what we can do by ourselves, so now we have to think of acquisitions as well as alliances,"" says Yoshihiro Suzuki, head of corporate planning at NEC.
Fujitsu's $13 billion purchase of a controlling 80% stake in Britain's ICL, completed in 1990, was the industry's first big step in that direction. Though Fujitsu also holds a 44% stake in Amdahl, an American mainframe maker with $2 billion in sales, it was not an expensive purchase. Fujitsu helped found the firm in the early 1970s by backing one of IBM's former top engineers.
If Hitachi and NEC decide to splash out, there will be plenty of companies to buy. Italy's Olivetti and France's Groupe Bull already buy mainframes from Hitachi and NEC respectively, just as ICL bought the core components for its mainframes from Fujitsu before being acquired. State-owned Bull may not be for sale, but NEC already holds a 5% stake in the company and the link could become stronger. An ailing Olivetti is also looking for partners. In addition, Hitachi sells $100m-worth of computer equipment a year through Comparex, a German distributor owned by BASF, a German chemicals giant. In the throes of its own reorganisation, BASF might be happy to sell Comparex to Hitachi.
Fujitsu's hands-off attitude to its foreign affiliates has drawn extravagant praise outside Japan and been touted as an example of the direction in which a decentralising IBM should move. Amdahl prides itself on its all-American management. ICL stresses the unwonted speed with which Fujitsu approved its own $400m purchase of Nokia Data, a Finnish personal-computer maker, early in 1991.
The Japanese company does deserve some plaudits for sensitive management of far-flung operations. But that approach has its costs. The ICL purchase leaves Fujitsu with three competing mainframe distributors in Europe--itself, Amdahl, and ICL. Fujitsu may also end up supporting three different workstation designs: one each from ICL and Sun Microsystems (Fujitsu re-sells the American firm's machines in Japan), and a new one dreamed up by Hal Computer Systems, a small Californian firm in which Fujitsu bought a stake last year. Wary of dictating to overseas managers, Fujitsu has made no effort to streamline this hotchpotch of competing products.
The obvious way for Fujitsu to exploit ICL would be to use it as a sales channel in Europe. So far, it is doing so only in a limited way. ICL plans to resell Fujitsu's cash dispensers in Britain and its mainframes in Eastern Europe, but neither of these markets is large. And though Fujitsu is considering selling ICL's workstations and personal computers in Japan, it has not promised to do so yet. The most useful thing ICL gets from Fujitsu may simply be its size and name, which has already boosted ICL's credibility with big British customers who had begun to doubt the firm's chances of long-term survival.
Letting a subsidiary go its own way looks sensible when it is doing well, less so when it is doing badly. When Fujitsu bought ICL in 1990, the firm was the star of the European computer industry, having made L95m ($156) of profit the previous year. But analysts reckon that in 1991 its profits fell by 40%, and would have fallen by more were it not for lucrative government contracts. Amdahl's forecasts are down even further, partly due to Fujitsu's late delivery of the chips that power Amdahl's new mainframe models. Even if Fujitsu's money and technology help the two firms hold their own against competitors, attacking the world by proxy may not be all that fearsome a strategy."

George Bush's arrival in Japan on January 7th--accompanied by the bosses of Detroit's ""big three""--has rattled Japanese car makers and trade officials more than anything since they were forced to accept ""voluntary restraints"" on their car exports to the United States a decade ago.
Japan's exports of motor vehicles and parts to America are equivalent to three-quarters of the imbalance in bilateral trade. America's deficit with Japan is expected to total $42 billion for the year ending in March, up 10% on the previous fiscal year. The White House's official line is to seek more sales of American cars in Japan rather than to impose further restrictions on Japanese car makers. But General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are chalking up their biggest losses since 1983. Last month GM shook public confidence in America by announcing plans to close 21 factories and do away with 74,000 jobs. And a presidential election is only 11 months away. Small wonder, then, that officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) have been twisting arms in Tokyo to get more Detroit-built cars on to the streets of Japan.
The fact that Detroit's car makers want help from Japanese bureaucrats is more an illustration of the American industry's dismal performance than Japanese protectionism, which American managers predictably blame. Between them, GM, Ford and Chrysler sold around 18,000 cars in Japan last year. While Japanese car makers account for 30% of new car sales in America, Detroit had just 0.3% of the market in Japan.
During Mr Bush's visit, Japan's biggest car makers dutifully pledge to let some of their dealers sell American cars alongside their own models. Nissan says it hopes to be selling 3,000 Fords a year through its dealer network by 1994, provided the Fords can be delivered with right-hand steering (like the British, the Japanese drive on the left of the road). Mazda, which also imports Fords (as Ford is a minority shareholder), intends to double the 1,700 American-built models it currently sells by next year. By 1994 Honda hopes to triple the 430 Chrysler Jeeps it sold domestically last year. Toyota has offered to ""introduce"" its regular customers to GM models offered by the American firm's importer, Yanase. If the various plans work out, America could be exporting $6.4 billion-worth of motor vehicles to Japan by 1994--two-thirds more than it does today.
Despite the headlines, these promises will barely scratch, let alone dent, America's deficit with Japan. Far more significant will be the extra car parts that Japanese car makers have promised to buy from American firms. Officials at MITI have bullied Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Honda and Mazda into promising to boost their purchases from American parts suppliers by 90%. That could amount to $19 billion-worth of business by 1994. Less than 20% of the parts will actually be imported into Japan, with the rest going into Japanese assembly plants in America. Even so, the American-made components should substitute for parts that would otherwise have been exported from Japan, which may help reduce the deficit.
Instead of relying on MITI and the goodwill of Japanese rivals, American car makers would do better to ape their European competitors. A decade ago, Detroit's ""big three"" sold more cars in Japan than all the British, French, Italian and Swedish car makers combined; only West German makers sold more. While left-hand steering has some snob appeal in Japan, fewer than half the Japanese tempted to buy a foreign car want it. The Europeans scored by offering both left-and right-hand drive versions. They also took the trouble to modify their cars' headlamps, restyle number plates to fit the shape and size used in Japan and install kilometre-per-hour speedometers and locally-made radios. More important, European car makers added a warning light to show when pollution-control equipment attached to the car was overheating, an important feature in a country where most cars sit in crowded traffic for hours every day and urban air pollution is chronic. Instead of catering to this legitimate demand, American car makers complained that it was an import barrier and futilely lobbied to get it abolished.
By tailoring their products for Japanese tastes, European car companies have seen their Japanese sales soar six-fold since 1983 (see chart). (chart omitted) On paper, American car exports to Japan have also risen--but no thanks to Detroit. The bulk of America's car exports to Japan now come from ""transplants"" owned by Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Mitsubishi in the United States.

This headline appeared frequently during President Bush's visit to Japan on January 7th-10th. The same request has made the front pages of American newspapers on almost every presidential visit of the past two decades. To the man in the street, the inference is clear: Japan's markets were closed then, and must still be now. To the economist, the issue is more subtle: does Japan import as much as it ought to, given its size and state of development?
One thing is certain: Japan does import a lot, so its markets are by no means closed. As the table on the right shows, in 1990 Japan was the world's third-largest importer, buying $235 billion-worth of goods. (table omitted) This was $52 billion less than it exported, which is why it had a trade surplus that other countries complain about. But its imports are what matter for judging the openness of its markets.
Those imports are clustered in a striking way. As the table below shows, Japan exports very little food, raw materials or fuels, but imports a lot of these; by contrast it imports relatively few motor vehicles or other machinery, which it exports a lot of. (table omitted) What that suggests is that Japan follows the principle of comparative advantage: exporting what it is good at making, and importing what it is less good at making.
Does it import enough, however? As a proportion of GDP, both Japan and America score low compared with West European countries: 8% and 10% respectively, compared with 23% in western Germany. Ranked by imports per head of population, Japan also comes out low: at $1,900 it has less than half the imports per head of Germany or France. But it is only a sliver behind America's $2,050. Which should Japan be compared with? Critics think it should be like Germany, since it has no natural resources and is not a large, continental economy like America; others think its geographical isolation from other rich countries, plus a GDP that is second only to America's in size, makes that country a more relevant comparison.
In any case, Japan's $235 billion total does not, of itself, refute the charge that Japan blocks some imports: perhaps planners merely choose to import this much, while markets would import more. In other words, do price signals operate in Japan? There was a handy experiment in 1985-90, when exchange rates between the yen, dollar and D-mark swung sharply, partly thanks to the Plaza and Louvre accords. It took Japan's trade flows almost two years to respond to this shift in the terms of trade, but then they did, spectacularly. In 1985-90 imports rose by 84% in dollar terms; during that period, the yen had risen by 65% against the dollar and 26% in trade-weighted terms.
This could simply mean that the blockages were constant, and market forces swirled around them, rather like tidal water around rocks in a bay. So are tariff and non-tariff barriers high? Japan's average tariff on industrial products is 2.6%, compared with 3% in America and 2.9% in the EC.
Non-tariff barriers, such as quotas, licences and voluntary export restraints grew to replace tariffs in many countries in the 1980s, but a World Bank study shows that the extent of such barriers in Japan is similar to that in America--which means both have risen. Japan uses more non-tariff barriers to protect agriculture than America, but America protects more of its manufacturers this way. Agriculture is the area in which Japan is most guilty of formal protection: its farm support is about 50% higher than the OECD average. An OECD study reckoned that in 1988 this put a burden on Japanese taxpayers and consumers of $90 billion a year, or 3.2% Of GDP.
Arguments about Japan's propensity to import have moved on from these formal barriers to informal ones such as culture, industrial structure and bureaucratic discretion. Culture and official meddling cannot be measured; anecdote suggests they do affect imports. But economists are supposed to be above anecdote. So recent attention has dwelt on industrial structure: do Japan's close-knit industrial groups restrain imports?
The best study on this issue(*), by Robert Lawrence of the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, concludes that these groups do repel imports, but is hard-pressed to say by how much. One of the problems is definition: what is a group? The same method of classification used by Mr Lawrence, taken from Dodwell Marketing Consultants, has at different times found there to be 17 keiretsu or 47--and it is not because the habit has spread.
The other difficulty lies in drawing a conclusion: if keiretsu do repel imports, is that a cause for grievance? To those who think all import repulsion is bad, the answer will seem obvious. But, as Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan points out in a comment attached to Mr Lawrence's article, his definition of a keiretsu--a group which prefers to buy from within itself rather than outside--is self-condemning. Mr Saxonhouse reckons that in many cases keiretsu firms buy from fellow group members because it is commercially advantageous--in other words, it follows comparative advantage. Nothing unfair about that.

Not only is New York itself one of the most beleaguered retail markets in the country, but on the second day of the convention preliminary figures for national retail sales in December will be published. They are not expected to be good. Yet amid the gloom now blanketing the industry, rays of sunshine are starting to peek through, at least for those retailers with strong balance sheets and a clear sense of direction.
The broadest ray is that, according to recent government figures, inflation-adjusted personal income has finally stopped declining and may even be growing again. Though the consensus of forecasts is that Christmas sales were flat, making for the third disappointing Christmas in a row, geography mattered a lot. In the south and southeast, where recovery is most advanced, December sales were probably up by 4% or more in real terms compared to a year earlier. Even a swish jewellery store like Tiffany's says that sales in its Houston store rose. The mid-western states probably saw 1-2% growth in sales volumes in December, and the western states a meagre 1% as the recession finally arrived there. In the north-east, where the recession is deepest, sales volumes probably shrank by a real 6%.
There were also considerable variations among types of retailers. Department stores and up-market specialised retailers continue to have a hard time in the battle for market share. Discounting chains have fared better than most, but those selling the cheapest goods suffered poor Christmas sales as shoppers looked for high quality as well as low prices. The most spectacular victim of that trend was Woolworth. On January 8th it announced it was giving up on 900 loss-making stores, at the cost of a $250m write-off against profits.
Many stores, especially those that did well at Christmas, also report a slight sales increase in early January. How much the pick-up in sales is doing for stores' profitability is another question. Deep discounting was the norm before Christmas. Heavy advertising and promotion costs have cut even further into margins. Suppliers have been keeping stores on a tighter credit leash, too. As a result, the pressure to control costs is fiercer than ever before. On January 7th Sears Roebuck, a troubled department-store chain, announced that it will shed 7,000 jobs, out of a total of 330,000, over the next three months by installing a $60m computerised cash-register system.
Things will also appear to get worse before they get better. Bankruptcies will rise in January, as they usually do. More than 17,000 stores went bankrupt last year. The most recent casualties have been Sterling Optical, Newmark & Lewis, an electronics chain, and Seaman Furniture, the north-east's largest furniture chain.
Like the much larger Campeau and Carter Hawley Hale store-empires, Seaman was a highly leveraged group that could not service its debt. All eyes are now on another highly leveraged retailer, R.H. Macy. Even if it survives, it may be too weak financially to invest enough in store revamping and new computer systems to keep up with industry leaders like Wal-Mart and Dillard.
The best indicator of whether or not good times are about to return to America's retailing industry may be the fate of Mall of America. This will be the country's largest shopping complex when it opens in the summer. Conceived in the go-go years of the mid-1980s, it will cover a monstrous 4.2m square feet of space (the equivalent of 20 New York City blocks) near Minneapolis. The site will contain four large department stores, 400 other stores, two theme parks and a two-level golf course, all under a single roof. Hope some shoppers show up."

At the time, top officials in America's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seemed to welcome the proposals to cut the delays and red tape, which have often held up the sale of new drugs for years. And the detailed proposals came from a prominent source: Vice-President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, which had been given the task of slashing unnecessary regulation throughout the Federal government. Despite this pedigree, and the publicity surrounding their announcement, the drug-reform proposals--which would have reshaped the drug industry--already seem to have been buried by bureaucratic and political opposition.
By late December a number of powerful Democrats in Congress had complained that Mr Quayle's council had kow-towed to drug-industry lobbyists by foisting its plans on the FDA. One subcommittee of the House of Representatives has subpoenaed FDA records in an attempt to prove this charge. Another has requested copies of all documents and telephone conversations linking the drugs industry with the White House.
A recent survey by Public Citizen, a consumer-rights group based in Washington, DC, found that over 80% of FDA employees oppose Mr Quayle's plan. Given that many of their jobs could be eliminated, this is hardly surprising. FDA bureaucrats are especially worried by Mr Quayle's suggestion that private review boards, rather than FDA officials, be used to approve drugs for human testing. They claim that such boards would be less discriminating and this could result in deaths.
But such fears maybe exaggerated. Drug companies in most other countries do not need government approval to begin testing drug on humans. And the FDA employs many more people than most other drug regulating agencies, even though it reviews the same number of drugs.
According to Scrip, a drug-industry trade magazine, FDA officials seem to be ignoring the faster approval procedures recommended by Mr Quayle's panel, and publicly accepted by their own bosses at the agency. Eli Lilly, an American drug maker, recently notified the FDA that it was planning to begin human testing on an experimental drug to treat Alzheimer's disease, specifically cited by Mr Quayle's panel as a high-priority illness. The drug had already been approved by a private review board, but not yet by the FDA itself. FDA officials promptly warned Lilly not to proceed with the study, declaring that the company's action ""appeared to be a notice of intent to violate existing law."" In November the FDA had claimed that no significant new regulations would be required to implement Mr Quayle's reforms."

Venezuela's proven reserves of 60 billion barrels are greater than those of any country outside the Middle East. A further 270 billion barrels of exploitable tar and pitch lie in the Orinoco belt in the south of the country. Oil keeps the nation's economy afloat. Petroleos de Venezuela (PDV), the state-owned oil company, provides 24% of the country's GNP, 86% of its foreign exchange and 83% of its tax revenue. Perhaps it was to be expected, then, that the government could not resist nationalising it in 1976, when oil prices were rising. But, in what is a discouraging omen for dozens of expanding state-owned oil companies throughout the developing world, PDV's ability to invest and compete is being badly hampered by an increasingly uneasy relationship with Venezuela's politicians.
Paradoxically, the source of the trouble is PDV's success. PDV is a first-world oil company, with a first-world oil company's hunger for investment. Venezuela, however, is still a third-world country, struggling to conquer poverty and trying to control inflation and public spending. The company has experts; the country borrows them to staff its underskilled ministries. The company must have billions of dollars of investment merely to maintain its position against competitors; the country faces civil unrest and rumours of a coup d'etat.
There has been no more public example of this conflict than Venezuela's general strike, called on November 7th. Among other demands, the strikers wanted the government to reverse last year's doubling of the price of petrol, even though the new price, 8 cents a litre, is ludicrously low. But the losses PDV is forced to swallow on domestic oil sales could be dwarfed by the damage done to the company's long-term prospects if its short-sighted political masters scotch its plans for huge, new investments, as they threaten to do.
PDV's managers are convinced that the company's immense reserves of crude oil are much less of an asset without the company's so-called ""downstream"" businesses in the United States and Europe. The world's fourth-largest producer of crude, PDV is also the third-largest refiner and the seventh-largest marketer of refined products. This is no accident. Without refineries abroad specifically equipped to process Venezuela's heavy, sulphurous crude, the country's exported oil would almost certainly lose out to low-sulphur, lighter Middle East crudes.
Yet PDV's downstream activities, like the company as a whole, have been starved of investment for a decade, largely because the company's profits have been taxed at a punitive 82%, more than double that paid by most other oil companies or other Venezuelan firms. In an attempt to catch up last year, the company unveiled a five-year investment plan worth $48 billion. Of that, $18 billion will be spent on peripheral businesses--natural gas, petrochemicals, a tanker fleet, and a new fuel, called orimulsion (see box). (box omitted)
The remaining $30 billion will be spent on the core oil business. Half of it is needed merely to maintain PDV's output at today's levels. The rest must be put towards keeping pace with OPEC's giants in the race to add production capacity and to build the refineries equipped to process the heavy oils, which make up 80% of its reserves.
It is this plan that is now in jeopardy. The plan has already been extended from five to six years. Last year, prodded by the International Monetary Fund, the government tried to get PDV to cut its investment by some $1 billion, or 20%. After a public row, the company made cuts of only $400m. But the government, under pressure to pare its own budget to curb inflation of 35% and to use whatever room it has to boost public-sector wages, may be more insistent in the next battle over PDV's ambitious investment plans.
The absurdity is that PDV's investment in its domestic non-oil businesses is far better protected against such meddling precisely because it has been allowed to invite foreign partners to help it develop Venezuela's natural gas, petrochemicals and coal. Only $3 billion of the $18 billion that will be invested in these businesses will come from PDV itself. Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi will be putting up most of the $3 billion for the Cristobal Colon liquefied natural-gas project, which is expected to get congressional approval within a few months. Shell, Italy's AGIP and Veba, a German company with which PDV has a large refining joint venture in Europe, will expand Venezuela's coal-mining capacity six-fold, to 10m tonnes a year by 1996. The country's promising petrochemicals industry, which is founded upon supplies of natural gas that are produced virtually free along with the oil, is also planned to grow six-fold, though production wholly owned by PDV will grow by only 30%.
So why not treat oil like other Venezuelan resources and break up or privatise PDV? To most Venezuelans the question is absurd. Oil, unlike natural gas or coal, is considered part of the national heritage: foreigners keep out.
What a pity. Private ownership has been good to the Venezuelan oil industry. True, western companies failed to invest much in the early 1970s, but this was because they saw nationalisation looming. A better reflection of those times is the universal praise that western analysts give today's managers of PDV. Those high standards were inherited: before nationalisation 95% of the industry's employees, including some of its top managers, were Venezuelans. Maybe someone should explain to Venezuela's politicians the parable of the golden goose.
ORINOCO ALCHEMY
Beneath a swathe of land half the size of Portugal, on the banks of the Orinoco River, lie 1.2 trillion barrels of tar and pitch, more than the world's entire proven oil reserves. Even if only about a fifth of the stuff can be extracted economically, as PDV managers dream, Venezuela would, at a stroke, dwarf Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil exporter. The trouble is that tar is too thick to refine or burn. So PDV is spending billions of dollars to turn this muck into black gold.
Canada and Russia also have heavy oil, in the form of tar sands and oil shales, but Venezuela has the advantage: its tar costs $3 a barrel to pump out of the ground. Mining oil sands and shales costs up to $9 a barrel. Fifteen years of research by PDV have led to two schemes to exploit the country's ocean of tar.
The first, already a commercial venture, is to turn the tar into an emulsion containing 70% oil and 30% water. Because this emulsion flows, it can be transported cheaply. It can also be burnt in power stations. PDV already has six contracts to supply power generators in Europe, America and Japan with 10m tonnes of orimulsion, as it calls the fuel. A further 26 deals are under discussion. The company hopes to supply 40m tonnes in 1996. The fuel's attraction is that it requires little investment to equip many existing power stations to use it. For a mere $10m-15m, an oil-fired power station can be adapted to take the fuel, which is handy: since the oil-price shocks in the 1970s, lots of oil-fired stations have stood idle. Orimulsion's biggest drawback is that, even though it is cheap, it contains lots of polluting sulphur.
The second scheme is based on a process called hydrocracking-distillation-hydrotreatment (HDH). This converts tar into top-quality crude, which can then be distilled in the usual way. PDV believes that it can produce crude from the process for roughly $15 a barrel. Foreign partners will help pay for the investment, no doubt tempted by PDV's promise of exploration licences in Venezuela for conventional crude for those companies that oblige. There is no doubt that HDH is a valuable technology. But conventional refining produces heavy tar-like residues (available virtually free) that may yet prove a more attractive feedstock."

For consumers, on the other hand, commodity markets were a bargain bazaar. Recession in English-speaking economies and slow growth in the rest of the industrialised world, together with the collapse of the Soviet Union, kept prices for many commodities near record lows.
Each week The Economist publishes a set of commodity-price indices. Our indices are based on 1985=100 and weighted by the value of imports into OECD countries in 1984-86, net of intra-EC trade in commodities affected by the common agricultural policy. In previous years we have published an annual summary of the indices, together with all the background numbers. As this is for specialists, starting this year we will run only the summary, making the background figures separately available*.
Judging from our indices, a feeble rally in the second quarter of the year was followed by another long slump in prices, taking them to the lowest level in real terms since this newspaper began calculating an all-item commodity-price index in 1845. Over the year as a whole, the all-items index, measured in terms of SDRS, a basket of currencies, fell by 10% and was 38% below its peak at the beginning of 1989.
Metal prices fared worst; by the end of the year the SDR metals index had dropped by 20% from its 1991 peak in April. Producers postponed costly cuts in output in the hope of riding out the recession, flooding the market with extra metal. Prices were depressed further by the collapse of domestic demand in the former Soviet Union and the country's desperate attempts to raise foreign exchange by increasing metal exports. Combined stocks of base metals held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses rocketed to a record 1.6m tonnes. LME aluminium stocks nearly trebled to 1m tonnes, and prices fell to just over $1,000 a tonne, a price at which most aluminium producers run at a loss. Copper prices, which had been buoyed by speculative hoarding in the second half of the year, fell by 15% in December alone.
Other industrial materials also suffered. The slump in the tyre industry dragged rubber prices to a five-year low. The Australian Wool Corporation, a government agency, found itself saddled with a stockpile of 4.7m bales, equivalent to Australia's average annual wool production, and debts of $2.3 billion, and ended 17 years of price support in February. As a result, wool prices plunged by a third before recovering partially towards the end of the year. Cotton prices fell by 26% in the second half of 1991 to a 2-1/2-year low of 61 cents a lb.
Food prices, in SDR terms, declined by only 2% in 1991, avoiding a steeper fall largely because of a rise in grain prices, which were sustained by a 6% fall in output after 1990's record harvests. The Soviet grain harvest was only 166m tonnes, the lowest for seven years. Chicago wheat prices climbed by 55% to over $4 a bushel, thanks to subsidised sales of American grain to the Soviet Union and China. America's wheat stocks were forecast to be only 11m tonnes by mid-1992, the lowest since the 1970s. Surpluses of coffee and cocoa took prices to 16-year lows. After seven years of bumper crops, world cocoa stocks stood at a record 1.5m tonnes in September. But output is set to fall in 1992, and prices turned up in the second half of the year in anticipation.
Whether the republics of the former Soviet Union manage to import food will be a powerful influence on food prices in 1992. Given continuing American credit, they could import up to 40m tonnes of grain in 1992. But imports of other foods, such as sugar and tea, are likely to be hit by their lack of hard currency. In the West the prospect of a slow economic recovery this year, if not a prolonged recession, will give little comfort to rubber, metal and wool producers. Prices are not likely to rise by much.
* Detailed indices of prices--annually 1985-91, monthly 1990-91, and weekly for 1991--will be published in The Economist Yearbook next month. For those who cannot wait, a print-out can be obtained from our Research Department, 25 St James's street, London SW1A 1HG."

The Securities and Investments Board published its first paper on the subject in 1989; its core rules on softing came into force last November. But in December the SIB put another paper around the City, reactions to which were due by January 10th. One side in the argument is determined to call into question the very structure of London's biggest firms. An unassuming technicality is now a point of principle.
In the early 1980s, when soft commissions came to Britain, they seemed a fine way for fund managers to get their hands on the computer-based research then emerging from independent boutiques. Traditional full-service brokers demanded a commission on each share transaction, offering the services of its dealers and analysts in return. Soft-commission houses also charged commission for their dealers; but rather than advice from in-house analysts they offered independent research. They put aside an agreed proportion (50% in the early days) of the fund manager's commission to buy research or databases of his choice.
In 1986 Big Bang unfixed brokers' commissions, so destroying the old reason for packaging dealers' services with analysts' advice. Now commissions could fall until they covered only dealing; fund managers would pay extra for research. Unbundling seemed set to bring a vast economy, for much of the old research went straight into fund managers' bins. It also promised keener dealing, since the dealer would know that his flow of orders depended only on his prices, and not on the quality of the analyst next door. Bundling had muffled price signals. Now that commissions were negotiable, surely things would change?
Not entirely. Commissions paid by institutional investors did indeed drop after Big Bang. That pinch, together with slack markets, has meant the sack for some of those analysts whose reports languished unread. Yet the bundling together of research and dealing persists. Investment managers seem undismayed by muffled price signals. Their main concern is to keep on paying for research with commissions that come out of their clients' funds. Paying out of their own pockets might force them to reflect the true cost of their services in bigger fees.
London's regulators have declined to meddle with traditional commissions, but soft ones have claimed plenty of their time. Specialist soft-commission houses denounce this discrimination. The regulators retort that soft commissions are more dubious than hard ones, because they make the bundling tighter. The fund manager knows exactly how much research he earns with each trade, whereas full-service brokers are vaguer about the number of orders required to earn good analysts' advice.
Though deemed shadier than full-service brokers, soft-commission specialists console themselves that the SIB'S long consideration of their business has not led to a ban. Last year's rules merely limit the range of services that can be bought via soft commissions (no carpets or sports cars), and insist that fund managers disclose their use of soft commissions to their clients. In recent months, however, things have changed. Integrated securities houses--the juggernauts that gather together market makers, dealers and researchers--have grabbed a growing share of the soft business from small, soft-only firms. On January 7th javelin, one of London's three soft--only-brokers, confirmed that Greenwell Montagu Stockbrokers, a subsidiary of Midland Bank, had agreed to take a stake in it. To most outsiders, this looked like a rescue.
The assault by the integrated houses has been led by S.G. Warburg, the largest of them all. Since 1990 it has supplemented its traditional broking with soft commissions carrying refunds of 83%. The independents charge that Warburg and its fellow juggernauts cannot possibly profit from this business, and that they make the money back by passing the orders to their in-house market makers, who take a lavish spread.
If true, this would be unacceptable. The SIB'S rules allow softing only where a broker is paid to execute an order; fund managers may not take soft money when dealing direct with a market maker. The charge that the integrated houses use soft commissions to buy business for their market makers would, if proven, also suggest that softing does dampen fund managers' efforts to ensure that they deal at a good price.
But proof is elusive. A survey of the City's ten biggest brokers, undertaken by KPMG Management Consulting and put about by Warburg's rivals, estimates the cost of dealing and settlement at L136 ($256) per deal. The average order from an investment institution is for L200,000-worth of shares, giving a commission (after soft refunds and other deductions) of L51 to the broker. That suggests that refunding 83% of the fee would produce a loss on each deal of L85.
These figures include the cost of sales advice, which does not apply to soft-commission business; taking it out would cut the cost per deal by half. Besides, Warburg retorts that its costs are lower than its rivals', and the soft orders that it accepts much bigger. An order worth L500,000, for example, would generate a fee of L152.
The SIB is keen to avoid nice arguments about individual firms' costs. Its latest paper merely asks how fund managers are satisfying themselves that they are getting best execution. The answer will no doubt be that Warburg does not require its clients to state whether a particular order is soft until after it is done: the market makers thus cannot pursue a policy of taking wider spreads on soft deals. Yet the market maker in any integrated house may well know which order comes from which client, and he may also know which client likes softing. Similar worries have prompted America's regulators to forbid brokers from executing soft-commission orders in-house. Britain's SIB is more protective of market makers, since their constant two-way prices provide the London market's liquidity. (In America much of the liquidity comes from order-matching on the country's exchanges.) Soft-commission broking is likely to continue undisrupted in Britain's integrated houses, whatever its drawbacks.
Yet the arguments will drag on. Some soft supporters point to America, where the habit caught on earlier and now provokes little regulatory debate. That in itself is cause for pessimism. America's soft dollars have spread beyond fund managers; they are increasingly used to buy services for pension-fund trustees too. Consultants to the trustees are often paid in this manner; the result, say some critics, is that they press for the appointment of fund managers who trade actively, since active trading generates more soft dollars. That prospect ought to worry all members of Bristish pension funds."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139161/fulltext/168DC7AA42424A66PQ/47?accountid=14657,"Michel Albert, the head of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), a state-owned French insurer, is a fan of German-style capitalism. In a book published last year, he heaped praise on a system, which, he says, ""values collective success, consensus and attention to the long-term."" Yet AGF'S recent behaviour has been decidedly unGermanic. On January 8th it announced that it had spent FFr3.5 billion ($800m) buying--just over a quarter of Aachener and Munchener (AMB), Germany's third-largest insurer with DM12 billion ($7.2 billion) of estimated premium income in 1991. An AMB Spokesman described AGF'S stake-building as ""unwelcome"".
Why is Mr Albert failing to practise what he preaches? The answer is that AGF, like other French insurers, desperately wants a foothold in a market which now includes some 17M underinsured former East Germans. AGF is also keen to reduce its dependence on the sluggish French market. By 1993 it wants overseas operations to account for 40% of its total sales, up from a third in 1990. A pact with AMB would help it to achieve both goals.
The snag is that AMB is already closely involved in Europe with Fondiaria, an Italian insurer, and Britain's Royal Insurance. In November 1991 the three said they planned a strategic link-up to be known as the European Partnership for Insurance Co-operation (EPIC). Details have yet to be agreed, but the insurers are to sell their European activities outside their home countries to a Dutch-based holding company in which they will hold equal stakes.
AGF says that it would consider participating in EPIC if asked, but ideally it wants a privileged partnership with AMB. The two firms are no strangers. In April 1990 AMB asked AGF if it would be interested in linking up. After a month of talks, the Germans changed their minds. Though the two have kept in touch, their relationship has soured since AMB'S new chief executive, Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, took over from Helmut Gies in January 1991.
AGF then built up its stake in the German firm. After Royal Insurance placed its 18.8% stake in AMB with Credit Suisse in December 1991 in exchange for some L250m ($469m), AGF tried to buy it. It failed because the shares carried restrictions which meant that they could not be sold without the prior approval of AMB'S management. AGF also tried to buy Dresdner Bank's 10% stake, but was rebuffed. One financier close to the affair reckons that Allianz, Germany's biggest insurer and a large shareholder in Dresdner, told it not to sell.
AGF has nonetheless managed to buy a sizeable stake in AMB. That may not do it much good. As part of the German company's anti-takeover defence, its shares have to be registered by its management before their voting rights can be exercised. So far AMB has registered AGF shares accounting for only 9% of its capital. If it does not register more, the French company may consider legal action.
AGF, however, still claims that its intentions are amicable. Yet Fondiaria confirms that, in the past, it has been approached by Paribas, a French merchant bank, acting on AGF'S behalf, with a proposal that AGF and Fondiaria should co-operate together to control AMB. The Italian insurer, which has a 5.8% stake in AMB, said no.
Could AGF take control of AMB alone? That seems unlikely. The French firm has a big handicap: it is state-owned. The German financial establishment would not let one of its biggest members fall into the hands of the French state. Nor would Fondiaria, which has an option on Credit Suisse's stake. On December 8th AMB bought Fondiaria's 25% of Volksfursorge, a German insurer that was jointly controlled by the two firms. Fondiaria might use the DM600m to increase its stake in AMB. Alfonso Scarpa, Fondiaria's chief executive, says the best solution for all concerned would be for AGF'S shares to be placed with German institutions acceptable to AMB.
Mr Baumgartl will no doubt echo this view at a meeting with AGF in Paris on January 14th. The French firm will not listen. Unlike Italy's Pirelli, whose bid for Continental, a German tyre company, failed because it could no longer support the cost of carrying Continental's shares, AGF says it will wait years if necessary for AMB'S management to change its mind. After all, one of the things Mr Albert admires most in Germany is ""attention to the long-term""."

Beside them stand the clipboards on which the multicoloured tickets are displayed; behind them is the fourth-or fifth-biggest investment organisation in Spain.
The National Organisation for the Blind (ONCE) pets Ptas285 billion ($2.9 billion) a year from the sale of cupones. As a charity, it is exempt from tax on these revenues. Yet since Miguel Duran took over as director-general in 1986, ONCE has become much more than that.
ONCE reckons the current value of its investment holdings at Ptas23.7 billion; some brokers find that figure overly modest. It has stakes in companies from construction to banking to broadcasting--including 25% of Telecinco, a private television channel of which Mr Duran is chairman--and is often a force in battles for corporate control. ONCE is formally under the tutelage of a council composed of government ministers, who are supposed to make sure that its financial resources are used in accordance with its objectives. In March 1991 a law was passed to let ONCE make investments without prior permission from the state.
Mr Duran now faces growing criticism, however. Some critics, mainly within ONCE, accuse him of overlooking the interests of the blind in his drive to put his organisation on the financial map. Others, including many in the press, suggest that he is too inclined to serve the needs of the ruling Socialist Party. His purchase and speedy sale last year of a newspaper that frequently opposed the government have given ammunition to his critics.
In April 1991 ONCE bought 72% of El Independiente. In October it sold the stake to Jacques Hachuel, a French media magnate, for roughly what it had paid. El Independiente's staff were dismayed when Mr Hachuel closed the paper within days of buying it. Mr Duran has been at pains to deny published speculation that ONCE set out to silence an anti-government voice. ONCE spokesmen insist that the reasons for selling El Independiente were strictly financial: the paper was losing Ptas150m a month. That leaves unanswered two questions: why Mr Duran bought it in the first place, and why anyone then took it off his hands. Mr Hachuel is believed to want a stake in Telecinco.
Disgruntled ONCE members of a new pressure group, the Democratic and Progressive Group (GDP), call ONCE's behaviour in the matter ""discreditable"". Ricardo Gayol, who used to be deputy director of ONCE and now heads GDP, sets out broader grounds for complaint too.
Mr Gayol says that the organisation's current investment strategy jeopardises the pension entitlements of ONCE's members. ONCE's investments expose the organisation to unnecessary financial risk, members of the pressure group argue, and too little of the income from cupon sales goes to ONCE's 34,000 blind and disabled members. The lack of published audited financial statements makes both these arguments hard to assess. GDP's members are calling for internal elections, and an investigation into ONCE's business practices.
Whether or not they succeed, ONCE may well change course. In December Mr Duran said that ONCE's investment policy would become more selective. The organisation is not planning to spend more on the media and may start paring unprofitable investments elsewhere. A canny cooling-off as Spain's economy slows, or prudent profile-lowering as the Socialists lose popularity?"

On January 17th, when George Bush launched an air attack against Iraq, the gold price fell by $27 an ounce. The safe-haven theory was shattered and the market has been in a stupor ever since.
The case for a revival is simply put. Over the coming year mine production will fall, because with the gold price at its current level of $350 an ounce, a tenth of world mine capacity is operating at a loss. On the other hand, demand for jewellery and coins will continue to grow, as it has done since the beginning of the 1980s. Meanwhile, sales from the former Soviet Union will dry up and difficulties in western economies will scare investors eager to shelter their money. Conclusion: 1992 will see gold rally to $450 an ounce.
That view finds support in the gambler's hunch that a loser cannot lose for ever. Gold funds won a wooden spoon in 1991 as one of America's worst-performing investments. If, following the perverse reasoning that yesterday's failure is tomorrow's success, that is not cause enough for optimism, think of the decade that preceded it. Gold has done poorly since January 1980, when it climbed to $850 an ounce. Since the middle of 1987, the price has fallen steadily, hitting a five-year low at the beginning of September last year. Sooner or later, the argument goes, gold's luck is bound to change.
The chart, mapping the real price of gold against production, shows one reason to doubt such logic. (Chart omitted) Far from being a sensible standard against which to measure gold's performance, the price in 1980 was completely anomalous. Never before in modern financial history had it approached such a level. Indeed, the chart indicates that gold prices still have some way to fall before they improve. Nevertheless, today's combination of falling prices and record output does suggest that optimists might be on stronger ground when it comes to predicting a decline in mining production.
However, that is to reckon without the arsenal of tricks that miners now use to get the best price for their metal--tricks that were unknown during the last peak in mine production in the 1960s. Details are hard to come by, but one study last year by Jessica Jacks, an economist with RTZ, a British mining giant, is thought-provoking. She found, from a sample covering two-thirds of western production outside South Africa in 1990, that more than 1,100 tonnes of various years' production had been hedged, through devices such as forward sales and low-interest borrowings of central-bank gold. (Total western output in 1990 was 1,700 tonnes.) Australians, who are by far the biggest hedgers, had sold forward 80% of 1990's production at an average of $447 an ounce. The spot price only once reached even $423 during the entire year.
Such manoeuvring caps the price of gold by allowing miners to sell gold that they do not have, hence expanding tradable supply substantially. It also helps to keep mines open long after depressed spot prices suggest that they should have cut output or shut down altogether. A price spike can take many years to work its way through the system: Ms Jacks found that a little of Australia's production as far forward as 1996 had already been sold. Moreover, she believes that the hedging habit is growing in both North America and South Africa.
All this tends to make gold markets less volatile--a good thing for any normal commodity, but a handicap for a metal whose main attraction as an investment was its sensitivity to the state of the world. No wonder that investors have ended up preferring other shelters for their money to gold. From 1973 to 1980 the gold price tracked America's rate of inflation closely. After 1986 the correlation broke down. Gold has similarly, though less completely, become unhooked from the dollar. According to William O'Neill, an analyst in New York with Merrill Lynch, a large securities firm, there is no sign of big German and Swiss buyers returning to the market now. Only financial melt-down could make a sudden difference.
There is little real reason to think that the demand for jewellery and coins can act as anything more than a brake to gold's falling price. True, jewellers' purchases of gold quadrupled to almost 2,000 tonnes in 1980-90, according to Gold 1991, an industry handbook. Yet the main reason for this enormous increase was that the price of gold fell. Even though buyers in the traditional markets of India and East Asia now continue to provide some support to prices, they could well lose their taste for the metal. Not only are Asia's financial markets fast being liberated--providing more convenient vehicles for investment--but real interest rates there have at last become positive, making non-interest-bearing metal less attractive.
One prospect stands out in the gold bugs' gloom: the former Soviet Union. It has reserves of only 240 tonnes, a tenth of what most western analysts had long reckoned it had. Moreover, years of under-investment are taking their toll. The boss of the Magadan region in Siberia said recently that output there has fallen by 10% in three years. Ukrainian miners, who make up 30% of the workforce in some areas, are returning home, partly because they doubt that they will receive their bonuses.
All this matters, because what was once the Soviet Union has traditionally met about 15% of western gold demand. Andrew Smith, a gold analyst in London at UBS, a Swiss bank, thinks that sales from that source could fall by as much as half next year. He expects that Russia and the other republics will try to use gold to shore up their rickety financial systems, rather as Brazil did in the mid-1980s. The Soviet Union entered into a number of swap agreements, under which it was to exchange temporarily its gold for hard currency, but repeatedly failed to buy back its collateral. If the republics were to succeed, they could find swaps a handy way of building up their gold reserves while using them to get hold of foreign exchange. Eventually gold might even find a role in backing a fistful of new currencies. It would not be enough to reverse the metal's decade of ill fortune quickly, but it could just be the start of a long convalescence."

Wachovia has not suddenly abandoned the famed credit conservatism that lets it bow only to J.P. Morgan among American banks at the pinnacle of Standard & Poor's credit rating. No: like both BankAmerica and the Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover banks, Wachovia is discovering that merging can be an unexpectedly costly affair.
Wachovia's fourth-quarter earnings were wiped out by the surprisingly large $207m charge that it is taking, mostly because it has bought South Carolina National. The merger was formally consummated last month and made Wachovia, with $33.2 billion in assets, the nation's 18th-largest bank.
Wachovia had expected to absorb no more than a $97.8m charge against South Carolina National's dodgier assets, plus $16m, for merger expenses. The combined bank will now be taking a $103m loss in the quarter for duff loans and will make a further $169m loan-loss provision.
The safe assumption is that the problem loans reside on the South Carolina side of the marriage, not Wachovia's. Wachovia has prospered by adhering to the simple, but frequently forgotten, banking principle of making as few bad loans as possible. In particular, it has eschewed the property lending which has hurt so many others, in the south-east and elsewhere.
Wachovia's boss, John Medlin, is one of only a handful of chief executives in the bank's century-long existence. He believes in a sound loan book more than a growing one, with a passion matched only by his enthusiasm for ignoring banking fads and doing things ""the Wachovia way"" (an attitude that J.P. Morgan makes much of, too).
Instilling the faith, and Wachovia's demanding credit standards, in South Carolina National as swiftly as possible is the reason why Mr Medlin will take the fourth quarter charge in one go, however uncomfortable that is. Many in the bank think that its last big acquisition, of First Atlanta in 1986, was digested too slowly. Changing the newcomers to Wachovia's credit-management and customer-information computer systems is the most urgent task. Unlike many banks, Wachovia has a strong enough balance sheet to stand it.
Mr Medlin has also been preparing Wachovia for what he has long thought would be a decade of slow asset growth for banks in the 1990s. He is cutting its already sparse overheads and developing its trust business. He does not want those benefits dissipated by its new partner's bad loans.
Mr Medlin is dipping deeper into his pockets than planned to buy as clean a loan book as possible. His counterparts at the new Chemical--John McGillicuddy, the last boss of the late Manny Hanny, and Walter Shipley, Chemical's chief executive before the merger--are scraping around in theirs to buy more cost saving.
When the holding companies of the two banks were formally merged on January 1st, the new group increased the announced one-off restructuring charge, from $550m to $625m. This was mainly to cover the extra cost of switching to Manny Hanny's technology, which is more advanced but still little tried. Estimates of the annual cost savings that the merged bank expects from 1995 onwards were also raised, from $650m to $750m. Another unexpected call on its cash is the Federal Reserve's insistence that it put $250m more capital into its subsidiary banks than it had planned.
Despite this, Standard & Poor's is sufficiently impressed by the progress of the merger to consider upgrading the new bank's debt. That will be welcome news, since Chemical may be getting jittery about its ability to raise, all at once, $1.25 billion through a stock-offering due in late January.
A third merger has also run into unexpected costs. BankAmerica's proposed takeover of Security Pacific has thrown up as much as $4 billion-worth of non-performing assets that it is thinking of spinning off into a ""bad bank"", It had reckoned on only $1.5 billion-worth. Clearing out the rubbish will require capital, and the bank may have to issue $500m-1 billion-worth of shares to pay for it. It has already had to add $250m to the $900m in restructuring costs that it originally estimated.
That all three lots of banks are cleaning their houses so thoroughly is no bad thing, even though the costs are higher than expected. starting out with as little dust under the rug as possible improves the chances that a merger will be successful. The minority of bank bosses who have proved adept at merging often say that the key to success is to take the hard decisions early and then carry them out. Better still, do so before you start."

Companies that had borrowed too much money during the excess-loving 1980s (mainly in America and Britain) virtuously replaced debt with equity. Most did so straightforwardly, by issuing common stock. Some used roundabout methods, such as issuing debt and preferred shares that could be converted into common equity later. A few American companies employed Wall Street's latest mouthful of an innovation: preference equity redemption cumulative stock (PERCS).
With PERCS, custom-tailored equity has come of age. These, and instruments like them, use derivatives to raise equity when markets are inhospitable, and tap new classes of investor. With derivatives, equity can masquerade as debt and mimic the performance of the shares in another sector. Companies in need of equity once conferred full partnership rights on shareholders; securities like PERCS will let issuers curtail buyers' participation in the equity.
Issuers of the $4.7 billion-worth of PERCS outstanding have been companies with bruised balance sheets or unpopular shares. General Motors raised $640m through the first issue in June 1991. RJR Nabisco, an American tobacco and food company burdened with massive debt from its leveraged buy-out in 1989, raised $2 billion in November.
Both companies sold to investors preferred stock that must be converted into common equity after three years (the issuer can redeem the stock at any time). Investors get a high yield during that period (8.3% in the case of RJR Nabisco's PERCS), but accept a limit on potential capital gains. After three years Nabisco will redeem each instrument for common stock worth no more than $13.70. That is 35% higher than the share price when the PERCS were issued. Investors' potential loss is unlimited: they will have to accept the shares at $13.70 or less.
Investors have, in effect, bought common stock from Nabisco and, at the same time, sold to the company a call option on the stock (ie, the right to buy it at a pre-set price). The premium they earn for selling the option is paid in the form of extra yield on the PERCS. The option, exercisable by the company at $13.70, is what caps the investor's potential gain.
The cocktail appeals to investors because interest rates are low and high-yield investments are scarce. When short-term Treasury bills are paying less than 4%, PERCS offer current yields of more than 7.5% and the chance of some capital gain. Some investors who traditionally buy high-yield utility stocks plump for PERCS. They give up some of the potential gain because they think that the shares, like those of utilities, will not be too buoyant.
To issuers, PERCS look expensive: Nabisco could pay as much as 17% a year if its share price hits the ceiling. But companies like Nabisco and General Motors are in no position to quibble. Hungry for equity, they are competing with companies that have stronger balance sheets or brighter growth prospects during a recession. Besides, PERCS can save the issuer money if its shares rise steeply. Each increase in the share price beyond the cap benefits the company rather than the investor. Karl von der Heyden, Nabisco's finance chief, says PERCS fit the bill ""if you want to issue equity but deep down don't want to give it away"".
The idea behind PERCS is not new or terribly sophisticated. Bankers have already made similar concoctions synthetically and sold them to institutional investors, mainly in Europe. Swiss investors, for example, have bought the common stock of Nestle and simultaneously sold a call on Nestle's shares. Nestle gets no money from the sale of such synthetic creations, called buy-rights, but their behaviour as an investment is just the same. Indeed, Merrill Lynch, an American investment bank, reckons it can reproduce GM's PERCS and sell them more cheaply to investors.
Nor are PERCS the first security to harness this gimmickry to the task of raising capital for corporations. Securities with derivative frills, many of them hybrids of debt and equity, have a long history. In the 1980s Japanese companies raised billions of dollars-worth of debt at next to no immediate cost by offering investors warrants--options to convert the bonds into shares.
Until PERCS came along, investors, especially in America, looked upon structured derivatives as suspiciously exotic, even dangerously speculative. That is changing. Because the derivative is embedded in PERCS, rather than a separate instrument, they look less like casino investments. PERCS are the first significant derivative to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (apart from a few speculative options and warrants). That makes them easy to trade (and spares Morgan Stanley, their inventor, the burden of acting as market maker).
Corporate issuers are following, but more slowly. Although many have issued convertible bonds and preferred shares, few have been willing to issue highly structured equity. That, too, will change. According to Simina Farcasiu, of CS First Boston, an investment bank, ""companies are willing to explore equity plays that are not pure equity."" They will become more eager if America's Treasury decides, as it hints it will, to end the double-taxation of dividends on shares.
More innovation is on the way. CS First Boston, for example, is developing its own variation on PERCS, which could limit investors' loss on a falling share. As the fashion for equity spreads, so will tailored equity, the market's version of haute couture. And who knows? Some designer may even come up with a free lunch."

No longer. Since 1979, cross-border equity flows have increased 20-fold, according to Salomon Brothers, an American securities firm. One share trade in five now features a foreign investor or a foreign equity; in Europe it is one in three. In London, thanks to SEAQ International's market for foreign shares, nearly two-thirds of turnover involves a foreign investor, a foreign equity or both.
Such cross-border trades used to mean buying shares on exchanges abroad. But the fastest-growing business is now cross-exchange trading: buying and selling foreign shares at home. Salomon reckons cross-exchange trading in 1990 was some $875 billion, nearly 40% of all international equity trades. SEAQ International does nearly two-thirds of it, up from 7% in 1986, its first year.
Why has SEAQ been so successful? The market's users offer three reasons. One, it is a wholesale market for professional investors. Its average bargain size is $275,000, ten times as big as the Paris Bourse's; and it is less regulated than domestic exchanges with retail investors to protect. The second reason is the market's depth. With 55 market-making companies offering firm two-way quotes in both prices and quantities, SEAQ International offers investors more liquidity than many domestic exchanges, particularly in continental Europe. That is the main reason why it does half of all trades in big French and Italian shares, and a third of those in German blue chips.
The third claimed ingredient of SEAQ'S success is, nevertheless, that it complements rather than challenges home markets. Academic studies suggest that it has generated mostly new business. Yet many European exchanges resent the business in ""their"" shares that is done in London. Getting it back is one reason why exchanges such as Frankfurt and Paris have reformed their own trading systems.
The interdependence of SEAQ International and domestic markets is shown as much by its failures as by its successes. The exchange has tried in vain to attract trading in American shares. That is partly because the New York market is liquid, partly because investors fear trading ahead of New York's opening. The New York Stock Exchange's archaic rule 390, which forbids member firms from trading off the exchange while it is open, has also been an obstacle. But Madoff Securities, which claims to be the biggest trader of American equities in London, is not a member of the NYSE.
SEAQ has been more successful with Japanese equities. Here, too, time zones play a part: investors are readier to trade just after the main domestic market has closed than just before it opens. But it was the huge London-based business in Japanese warrants--bonds with an option to convert into equities--that underpinned the Japanese equity sector on SEAQ. When the warrant market collapsed, so did equity trading.
Not surprisingly, the competition is hotting up. Some German banks recently installed terminals connected to Germany's IBIS trading system in their London branches. On January 20th America's electronic stock exchange, NASDAQ, the world's third-biggest exchange, will open its international market in London. Initially it will offer only American equities, but it hopes later to add continental European shares and so compete with SEAQ. Ironically the two spent three years discussing a joint venture--which might have worked, since London's trading system was based on NASDAQ'S. London backed off.
New York also wants more of the world's cross-exchange business. The New York Stock Exchange currently lists only 108 foreign shares. It has none from Germany, largely because German companies are unwilling to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission rules such as the requirement to report results quarterly. William Donaldson, the exchange's chairman, is campaigning to relax these rules.
The bitterest fight will be in Europe, as London fends off continental efforts to win back business. The London Stock Exchange plans to upgrade SEAQ International's technology and hopes soon to include British blue-chip stocks on it. Critics argue that it should also improve the quality of its statistics--there are claims that SEAQ International's volumes are overstated--and beef up the commitment of its market-makers in hard times.
Whoever wins this battle, Europe could lose. Most cross-exchange trading is done where big pools of international money reside. For the past five years that has often meant London; the continent has less-developed pension funds, and American and Japanese fund managers are more inclined to invest at home. In future, however, internationally minded investors may increasingly be in New York and Tokyo.
Worse, wrangling among European exchanges might deter outside investors from using any of them. As a single currency approaches, big investors will be looking for a European exchange that maximises liquidity by concentrating trading. London has sometimes called for agreement on just such a market, but has not pressed because it wants to protect SEAQ. Yet nobody can ""protect"" a market in today's push-button age. If Europe's existing exchanges do not heed investors' desire for a large and liquid market, they may all be out of a job."

Thanks to the way the earth's axis wobbles, the pole star traces a circle in the heavens, only sometimes showing the way to true north. But it is a stay-at-home compared with the north magnetic pole, which sometimes leaves the arctic altogether and moves to the southern hemisphere. Currents in the molten metal of the earth's core. some 3,000 kilometres (1,900 miles) below the surface, give the earth a magnetic field which looks like that familiar from the bar magnets found in classrooms; a ""dipole"" field, with a north pole at one end and a south pole at the other. But unlike the bar magnet's field, which is frozen in cold iron, the earth's field is capable of flipping over, so that what was north becomes south and vice versa.
Such geomagnetic reversals happen at random, roughly four times every 1m years For animals using the magnetic field to guide their migrations, they are probably a bit of a headache. For geologists looking back on them, they are a useful puzzle. Some rocks, like bar magnets, have a permanent magnetic field, which records the direction of the earth's field when the rock was formed. These records can be used to show which rocks were formed at the same times. So the reversals are useful--but not fully explicable. Their origin remains somewhat mysterious. Now new evidence, though not solving the mystery, suggests that it maybe much more significant than it once seemed.
The liquid metal in the outer layer of the earth's core has a flow to it. Because of this, the core can behave like a dynamo generator; an electric current and the flow of the metal combine to create a magnetic field, which in turn keeps the electric current going. Mathematical descriptions of such self-sustaining dynamos show that the magnetic field produced can point in either of two opposing directions. Because the flow of the core must be linked to the earth's spin, the earth's dipole field will always end up pointing along the axis--but because of the mathematics, it can equally well point north or south.
As a general description, this is widely accepted. The details, though, are keenly debated whenever anyone scrapes together enough evidence to prompt a debate. Descriptions of the dynamo require enormously complicated calculations based on fluid dynamics, made yet harder by the fact that there are hardly any data about what the core is really like. Observations of magnetic reversals can provide some much needed empirical evidence--and thus trigger inevitable disagreements.
During the 1970s and 1980s magnetic reversals were seen as processes of decay and rebirth. The normal dipole field faded, there was a brief interregnum in which the field was weak and complicated--magnetic fields can have lots of poles, instead of just two--and then a new dipole field asserted itself, pointing in the opposite direction. Some models suggested that the new field grew at the expense of the old field, precipitating its decline; others that it just rose from the chaos. The mathematical models of this flip-flopping were among the first practical uses of chaos theory.
Last year, though, some of this picture came into doubt. Two different groups, one led by Bradford Clement at Florida International University and one by Carlo Laj at the Centre des Faibles Radioactivites in Paris, suggested that the field did not break up during reversals. Records from rocks that had recorded the field during reversals, they said, made it look as though the whole dipole was twisted, intact, through 180deg. In a reversal a little over 1m years ago, of which there is a particularly good record, Dr Clement thinks that one pole travelled down the middle of the Pacific while the other swung through Africa and Europe.
On top of this both groups found that the peregrinating poles often followed more or less the same path--one pole passing through the Americas and the other through Australia and East Asia. This, if true, could lead to a big change for the theorists. It is hard to see how any pattern or feature could persist in the core long enough to influence successive reversals; not much stays put in a turbulent liquid. Thus it could well be the earth's mantle, the huge mass of rock that sits between the brittle crust and the fluid core, that constrains the routes that reversals can take.
The rocks of the mantle, though ductile, move exceedingly slowly--so features at the base of the mantle may persist for many millions or years. Just as mountain ranges can influence the flow of the winds, so the topography of the mantle's lower surface could affect the currents flowing in the core. Models of the dynamo may have to look not just at the fluid motions of the core, but also at the strange inverted landscape against which the flows occur.
The idea that the dipole field remains intact throughout reversals is not universally accepted. Ken Hoffman of California Polytechnic State University, for example, thinks the evidence points to something else--but his alternative may have consequences just as profound. Dr Hoffman has measured the field during reversals using volcanic rocks, which provide quite precise data. His conclusion is that the north-south dipole all but disappears--but that another weaker dipole is then revealed, with an apparent north pole either somewhere near Brazil or in the region of Papua New Guinea. This sort of field, running along the equator, becomes apparent only during reversals, when the north-south dipole has broken down. Dr Hoffman suggests, though without firm evidence as yet, that there may be two processes creating fields, an idea others have looked at, too. A deep process might be responsible for the main field that lines up with the earth's axis of rotation, while one nearer the mantle provides the equatorial dipole Dr Hoffman sees during reversals.
A BLUSH CAN SHOW A CHANGE OF HEART
This sort of idea excites earth scientists. There has always been a tendency to see the earth as a set of nested shells--core, mantle, crust, atmosphere--each dealt with by separate specialists who often have little to say to each other. These new ideas suggest instead a picture of the earth as an integrated system, its different parts intimately bound up with each other; a world that has room in it for grand unifying theories.
Roger Larson, of the University of Rhode Island, has started developing one such theory. He thinks that 125m years ago a lump of the lower mantle shook itself free of the core and started to rise towards the surface like a bubble in beer. He uses this eructation to explain a 40m-year period during which the magnetic field never reversed itself.
Theorists suggest that the core's dynamo can generate two ""families"" of magnetic fields, and that the interactions between them might cause reversals. The strong dipole along the axis of rotation belongs to one family; a weak equatorial dipole would belong to the other. If that is so, and if the outermost core generates the field containing an equatorial dipole--an idea that fits with Dr Hoffman's findings--then the huge change in the lower mantle envisioned by Dr Larson might well have brought about a long reversal-free period by changing circulation in the outer core.
While the core enjoyed this unwonted magnetic stability, the ascending glob of hot mantle--a ""superplume"", so called to distinguish it from the lesser, though still impressive, plumes in the mantle which create oceanic volcanoes like those of Hawaii or Reunion--was making its presence felt on the surface. Dr Larson thinks it caused a vast amount of volcanic activity on the floor of the Pacific ocean; he estimates that lava attributable to the superplume spewed out into undersea plateaus and along volcanic ridges at a rate of 10 cubic kilometres a year. He thinks this hyperactivity pushed the ocean floors up, leading to a global rise in sea levels, and pumped carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, raising the temperature by as much as 10degC. Life flourished in warm, shallow seas.
There is evidence for the story's component parts. A lot of new crust was formed; sea level and temperature did rise. A huge amount of oil dates from the same time, as would be expected from the conditions in those shallow seas. But the strength of that evidence can be questioned. Not everyone agrees with Dr Larson on the scale of the volcanism; the once broadly accepted sea-level record has recently come in for a lot of flak; and there is no way of proving that carbon dioxide caused the temperature increase. The absolute level of carbon dioxide cannot be measured that far back--though a relative rise at the advent of the superplume might yet be found.
The fact that all these events coincided. does not prove common cause. Further work is needed to show whether they are indeed intimately connected. There may be other superplume events to look at; Dr Larson has already spotted one earlier candidate. As it stands, his idea is certainly intriguing in what it says about the core, in what it says about the surface, and in what it says about the links between the two.
These links between the earth's heart and the earth's crust could--indeed, probably should, if they exist--work both ways. Old crust slips down into the mantle at trenches on the edge of ocean basins. These slabs of old crust, cold and thus dense, may sink almost as far as the core-mantle boundary. Some seismological studies show anomalously cool patches in the lower mantle below East Asia and the Americas; they might be piles of sunken crust. The extent of these cold patches is vague--indeed, some geologists refuse to have any truck with the techniques used to make the seismological pictures. But temperature differences in the lower mantle could explain some of the details of reversals.
Not all these grand ideas will turn out to be true--indeed, it may be that none will, or that something more subtle than these broad brush-strokes is needed. Some respected geologists insist that the upper and lower mantle are isolated from each other, and that nothing ever gets from the core to the crust except heat. Many of their colleagues, though, are ever more drawn to the possibility of tying together the hot flushes on the face of the earth, the churnings of its guts and the tremors of its heart."

Executives regularly make decisions which affect the economic health of their companies and, ultimately, themselves. Animals face similar problems. Coming out of hiding to eat exposes you to predators, but too much hiding stunts your growth and may reduce your reproductive capacity into the bargain. Weighing up the cost of lost feeding time against the risk of attack is a trade-off. With instincts finely honed by evolution, even the humblest animals are often surprisingly good at assessing the risks.
New evidence of this ability comes from some clever experiments with barnacles. Barnacles feed by paddling--sticking their legs in the sea. No longer much use for walking or swimming, these legs are endowed with long rake-like hairs which comb the water for particles of food. If a predator, such as a fish, passes by, the barnacle quickly retracts them and hides inside its shell. If it is too slow, leglessness looms.
The nifty legwork of Balanus glandula a common North American barnacle, has been studied by Lawrence Dill and Jill Gillett of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. Barnacles do not just feed to keep body and shell together. Their growth rates, competitive success and the number of embryos per brood all appear to depend on their food intake. So time spent hiding is time wasted.
Dr Dill and Ms Gillett interrupted their barnacles' feeding by passing a shadow over them to simulate the approach of a predator. They found that barnacles allowed to feed for 45 minutes hid for between 29 and 47 seconds when a predator threatened. Barnacles that had fed for only five minutes hid for between five and ten seconds, after which they re-emerged from their shells and risked feeding again. If a barnacle's stomach is empty, the risk involved in eating can be outweighed by the damage done by fasting.
Barnacles seem to be able to predict the tides--a useful trick when you live between the tidemarks. Dr Dill and Ms Gillett took some barnacles from the shore to their laboratory. Kept under constant conditions in a tank, the animals still changed their behaviour according to the state of the tide in the outside world. They got more frantic when they thought the water level should be falling.
With four hours to go before low tide, barnacles hid, on average, for a leisurely 26 seconds when a predator came near. With only an hour to go, their hiding time was 15 seconds. In a last scramble to feed, barnacles will take greater risks. Or perhaps not. As the tide ebbs, predators move offshore, increasing the barnacles' safety. And the picking may be richer at low tide, counter-balancing any increased risk: as the ebbing seawater becomes more shallow, and therefore more turbulent, more food particles are shaken into it. Perhaps several effects operate simultaneously. Whatever the explanation, barnacles appear to have an economic logic underpinning their behaviour.
Computer modelling might bring a fuller understanding of barnacle risk-assessment. Data on predation rates, food availability, feeding rates, and on the relationship between food intake and fitness, would all need to be collected and incorporated. But on current showings, barnacles have the makings of pretty good company executives. They can do cost-benefit analysis. They are decisive. And, if a hostile takeover looms, they know at least one way to react. Hide."

The Zoological Society of London was founded in 1826 by Sir Stamford Raffles, who was winding down after founding Singapore. It is part gentlemen's club (though ladies are now admitted) and part learned society, with members still fastidiously divided into ""ordinary"" and ""scientific"" fellows. But the gentlemen have fallen on hard times. The society's research arm--the Institute of Zoology--still produces good quality science. But the society's London residence, the Regent's Park zoo, and its country place, Whipsnade, are dilapidated and losing money, victims of public distaste for old-fashioned zoos.
The decline has been going on for some time. The number of visitors to the zoo has been falling since the 1950s and, after several last chances, the government has turned off the subsidy tap. The first response was blackmail; the zoo more or less told the government to cough up, or see the surplus animals killed. There was no reaction, except public distaste, and no large cull either. The next reaction was a set of piecemeal reductions in the number of staff employed and species kept, combined with grandiose plans for expensive joint ventures--doing up the site to the tune of about L60m ($113m). The plans foundered when the venturers, calculating the increase in numbers of visitors needed to provide a decent return on their capital, pulled out.
More modest ideas were then floated for grouping the animals into ""themed areas""--pseudo-ecosystems in which the exhibits would mingle a bit like they do in the wild, though they would be discouraged from eating each other. This ""Disneyland"" approach was, for some fellows, the last straw. It was time, they decided, to change the zoo's leadership. Unfortunately, this is no easy task. In Raffles's day, democracy was also a strange beast, and rarely found in the menageries of governance. It was one which the ruling council did not deem necessary to introduce into the society. Times have changed, but the zoo has not. Fellows cannot vote people on to the council, nor can they vote them off. Only the bluntest political weapons are available. That is why, on January 6th, the council found itself facing a coup d'etat.
The girondins were led by Colin Tudge, a journalist and broadcaster who has written widely on zoos, and Stephen Cobb, a biologist who studies elephants. Their targets were the antiquated management structure, the creaking constitution and the council, which they felt was supine and self-satisfied. Their objectives were to stem the society's financial losses (over L4m last year), and then to redirect the zoo towards what they believe is its proper calling--fostering breeding stocks of rare and endangered species. The green image that the zoo would thus earn, they hoped, would bring back a public increasingly interested in conservation.
After a few preliminary skirmishes, the reformers managed to call a special meeting of the society. On January 6th some 300 fellows and staff crowded into a lecture theatre at the University of London. The council talked a lot about ""melding"" the reformers' plans with its own, and beat its chest a bit. A full-scale management review was promised, and the need for Royal (or, at least, Privy Council) approval for any change in the society's statutes was put forward as the reason for the council's previous sloth in the matter of constitutional reform--which now, of course, it sees as vital. As a stick to match these carrots, the spectre of David Trippier, a junior minister at the Department of the Environment, was invoked. The society gets its site in Regents Park rent-free--a perk at present being reviewed. That might be in danger if it suddenly found itself without anyone to do its negotiating.
When the reformers took the floor, they complained of the council's cavalier attitude to members, keepers and scientists; they might have added the public and other animals, for good measure. They welcomed the promises of goodies to come, while affecting surprise at the sudden change of attitude. They outlined their now-familiar plans. But they were missing one thing. Having forsworn personal ambitions, they had no government-in-waiting,
The threat of anarchy, together with the council's judicious retreat and self-criticism, were just enough to stop the tumbrils from rolling. The meeting voted by four to one to slap the council's collective wrist, passing a motion of no confidence in its past conduct. The main motion, though, which would have sacked the bulk of its 22 members--those that had been in office since before July 1991--was defeated by three to two. Had it succeeded, it would have left a rump of half a dozen recently appointed and broadly popular councillors to face the fearsome Mr Trippier and put things back in order. Spared their lives, the society's council promised to talk to the Privy Council about reform, shake up management and, above all, to listen to their members. They know the reformers will be listening, too, and may return if they do not like what they hear. The animals will no doubt be glad to know it."

It was lavatory paper, it seems, that doomed communism in Eastern Europe. Once people discovered that a kinder, gentler alternative existed, it was the end for Honecker, Ceausescu and co. Of course, communism failed to provide all kinds of things in proper quality or quantity; but as Slavenka Drakulic points out, women turned against the old regimes for just such delicate reasons.
Talking to women in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany at the beginning of 1990, Miss Drakulic, a Yugoslav novelist, finds similar complaints and survival techniques throughout Eastern Europe. To live under communism was a process of everyday dehumanisation, and she captures it sharply. At the Post Office, for example,
it was perfectly normal not only to have to wait in line pressed tightly together, but to peer at each other's documents, accounts, letters and bills quite shamelessly...Asking for the right to privacy meant you had something to hide. And hiding something meant it was forbidden. If it was forbidden, it must have been against the state. Finally, if it was against the state, you must have been an enemy.
One of the first reforms made by the new Yugoslav government was to introduce a yellow line in post offices, behind which people had to wait before they approached the counter.
Apart from the inevitable problems of shortages, women were united by a constant hankering after anything regarded as western. Even drinking from a Coke bottle became a symbolic gesture. Watching a young man eating a banana, Miss Drakulic becomes lyrical: ""It was not a banana he was eating, but the promise, the hope of the future.""
When the Berlin Wall finally broke, and items from the West flooded into Eastern Europe, women were both delighted and confused. The new order brought not only fruit and tampons but also pornographic posters, which were proudly displayed in buses, taxis and private homes as trophies of free expression. This was rather shocking to feminists, who are now busy trying to sort out sexist oppression from the old communist kind. ""It's hard"", Miss Drakulic writes,
to see [men] as an opposite force, hard to confront them as enemies. Perhaps because everyone's identity is denied, we want to see them as persons, not as a group or category, or a mass...we are not able entirely to distinguish us from them, and all of us together from it. So, in our kitchens, while the soup is boiling what we talk about is identity.
Which must make for a lot of spilled soup.
Many East Europeans refuse to surrender their unrealistic hopes for capitalism, and Miss Drakulic is one of them. Her idea of living standards in the West is still hugely inflated. She appears to believe that only under communism do women recycle things out of economic necessity. ""A nice, strong shoe box can have several purposes,"" she informs the reader, as though no woman in the West would realise that.
Similarly, Miss Drakulic still clings to a cloudy and romantic view of democracy. She can understand why telephone booths and parking meters were vandalised in the East--obviously, it was because people were frustrated with socialism--but she is shocked and bewildered to find the same thing in the West, where there seems no reason for it. She is shocked, too, to encounter beggars in New York. Perhaps, she reasons, westerners cannot see them there; perhaps only those people from the East, who possess a ""communist eye"", are alert to the presence of vagrants in the street. ""Like a third, spiritual eye placed in the middle of one's forehead, this eye scans only a certain type of phenomenon; it is selective for injustice.""
Old communist habits die hard, not least sanctimony. Despite her infatuation with the West and all its consumer goodies, Miss Drakulic has a strong inkling that freedom can be terrible; she concedes that, for all its destruction, communism offered her native Yugoslavia (and other countries) some sort of cohesion, and a brutal guarantee against tribal warfare.
On a more humdrum level, too, she is never far from the piety of the old order. ""I am not tempted to buy a dryer,"" she declares. ""I think I will always hang my clothes outside for the sheer poetry of it."" She goes on to tread imperiously on modern western sensibilities: ""Before [East European women] give up their fur coats, they certainly want to have them, at least for a while."" In her opinion, ecologists have no right to force ""a green totalitarianism on us, telling us what to eat, wear and think.""
In short, Miss Drakulic believes that the emerging democracies have earned certain allowances for what they suffered in the past. They cannot be expected to become politically correct overnight. And the long-suffering housewives of Eastern Europe surely deserve to take pride in their triumphs, before capitalism breeds a new kind of sourness in them."

Priggish people who call for the abolition of Britain's honours system fail to understand what a leveller it is: nothing brings a great man down so much as the sight of him grovelling to get a handle to his name. With so much scope for ridicule, a book about the honours system cannot fail to be funny. Michael De-La-Noy's work, for those who can put up with his partiality for double negatives, is not unamusing.
The advantage of the British system, built up through monarchs' desire to make money and reward favourites, is its utter incomprehensibility. Compare the dreary simplicity of the French Lion d'Honneur, so easily distinguishable from hereditary titles and quite divorced from political power. In Britain a prominent trade unionist can end up with the same handle as a 27th baron; and the latter, as a result of a curious historical oversight, is paid by the state (L156 a day if an overnight stay in London is necessary) to vote in the House of Lords on matters of national policy.
Complexity has created an industry around the British honours system. The proliferation of orders, crosses, baths and garters and the central question of who takes precedence over whom provides employment for crowds of otherwise useless double-barrelled younger sons. Even those experts cannot resolve the toughest problems. George V was unable to ask the wives of his old tutor and of the Master of the King's Music to dinner at the same time, because nobody could decide whether the wife of a clerical knight of the Royal Victorian Order took precedence over the wife of a lay Knight Bachelor, or vice versa. When the system was being created, these questions were serious political matters. In 1611 the privy council argued for three days over the question of whether baronets came below barons or barons' younger sons.
Snobbery is an essential ingredient of an honours system, and the range and variety of titles in Britain offer plenty of scope. To those familiar with the system, it seems, the wrong sort of honour can be a ghastly stigma. Elgar wrote to a friend that ""HM has offered me the KCVO [Knight Commander of the Victorian Order] (!!!) which awful thing I must accept! Alas!"". Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, according to the latter's biographer, were very depressed when Nicolson was offered the same honour, as it seemed ""so dreary and middle-class"".
The only trouble with Mr De-La-Noy's book is that he ends up taking the business seriously. Behind the delicious anecdotes of the titles sold by Lloyd George (knighthoods for L10,000, baronetcies for L40,000 and peerages for L100,000) to ex-convicts and others, there is a whiff of disapproval. A similar tone creeps into Mr De-La-Noy's discussion of Margaret Thatcher, who awarded peerages to such as Lord Cayzer (L218,000 to the party over three years before his peerage), Lord Matthews (L120,000 over three years) and Lord Forte (L96,000 over three years). Mrs Thatcher was simply pursuing the logic of privatisation into one of the dustier corners of state business. The only moral to be leaned is one of economics. The currency of honours has clearly been devalued, for in Lloyd George's time they fetched a much higher price in real terms."

Gastrulation sounds like some complex and hideous torture devised for the enemies of a particularly absolute oriental potentate. It involves turning you inside out. But you have done it. Everybody has. It is one important step on the journey chronicled by Lewis Wolpert. A journey which each person has made, but none can remember: the road from conception to birth. And in clever parallel to this journey, he chronicles the journey of a science--embryology--from its Aristotelian beginnings to the biochemistry of today.
The history of embryology reads like a piece of arcane theology, in which Faustian names like Malebranche and Malpihi bargain for knowledge with a recalcitrant nature. The result of all this dabbling is not yet the soul of the machine--the organising principles which turn a relatively simple fertilised egg into a complicated, functional mechanism called an animal. But researchers have many pieces of the jigsaw.
Mr Wolpert continually reminds his readers that complexity in animals is the integrated product of simplicity. The same themes are repeated over and over again within an embryo (Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, once said that embryos seemed to be very fond of stripes), and between the embryos of creatures as diverse as people, flies and sea urchins.
The mechanisms which allowed multicellular animals to get going in the first place seem to have been conserved: evolution, having hit upon a good idea, will discard it only reluctantly. Gastrulation, for example (the point where the embryo turns from a hollow ball of cells into something more like a doughnut with a hole through the middle), probably goes back to almost the earliest multicelled animals. The hole eventually becomes your gut. In the embryos of sea urchins, which have to make their living in the world almost as soon as they form, this happens straight away. The earliest animals that were not just hollow balls of cells probably looked rather like baby sea urchins.
Gradients also feature strongly in the embryonic alchemy--varying concentrations of chemical signals can tell cells where they are. Then, it is supposed, they look up an internal map which tells them what sort of cell is found in that part of the body, and turn into it. Whether, for example, they turn into a femur or a finger-bone depends on how far along your incipient arm they are. A combination of such simple mechanisms, put together in an ad hoc fashion, serve to assemble a mechanism as intricate as you like.
All this theorising sat in the doldrums for decades. Until the invention of molecular biology, embryologists were stuck with describing what happened with more and more accuracy, without having any real idea why it happened. Now that they can play with things like Cell Adhesion Molecules (a sort of molecular Velcro which tells what to stick to what) and look forward to increasingly accurate charts of the genetic instructions in the nucleus, things are advancing by leaps and bounds.
Coleridge once remarked that if man could remember his nine months in the womb, he would find much of interest, far beyond anything that happened to him afterwards. Mr Wolpert and his colleagues are trying to awaken that collective memory."

People often read the published diaries of the great, the good and the obscure at bedtime. They are a more amusing soporific than counting sheep. Pepys offers this comfort in abundance, together with an insider's view of great events. Diarists like Kilvert, obscure in their own lifetimes, record a wealth of mundane, nostalgic detail. But the journals of John Cheever offer none of these comforts. Instead, they chronicle in excruciating detail the slow distinct ration of a self-deluded drunk.
Cheever, who died in 1982 at the age of 70, was an American novelist and writer of short stories, a specialist in spare and graceful accounts of affluent suburbia. A winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and America's National Book Award, urbane, sensitive and sociable, he seemed the model of an American man of letters. But his journals, edited down from a manuscript of 4m words and covering a period of more than 30 years, reveal that the public image he worked so hard, and so successfully, to cultivate was a sham. Trapped in a destructive cycle of alcoholism and denial, Cheever wrote obsessively about his daily struggle to reach mid-morning without pouring a gin. He rarely made it.
The fascination of these pages lies not in what they reveal about Cheever as an artist, but in the compelling way they bring out the natural voyeur within every reader. Cheever recorded, relentlessly and repeatedly, his most intimate secrets: his dreads, his shame, his self-loathing. Page after page is filled with drunken quarrels with his wife; with lies, infidelities, religious doubts, homosexual yearnings and, above all, with his daily, desperate search for a bottle. Interspersed among these dreary horrors are purple passages about his love for his children, his dog and his fine house.
Cheever's talent as a prose stylist is obvious, but his ability to delude himself makes chilling reading. Although he falls down again and again, with numbing repetition, he can still look back at earlier entries and fail to see it. Here he is after 20 years of journal writing: ""Reading old journals, I find that the booze fight and the cafard have been going on for longer than I knew. I guess I'm stuck--a little stuck, at least--with the booze fight. Old journals help, but there is a strain of narcissism here. At the back of my mind there is the possibility of someone's reading them in my absence and after my death, and exclaiming over my honesty, my purity, my valour, etc. What a good man he is!"" Not a chance.
In an introduction, Cheever's son Benjamin defends his decision to publish the journals, arguing that Cheever himself suggested it during his last illness. By then he had given up alcohol and reached an uneasy reconciliation with his family. If he really did want these journals published, it looks suspiciously like a vain, remorseful old man's last attempt to make amends and raise a bit of money for his family."

Schubert and Beethoven never wrote for the instrument. There are plenty of works by Spanish salon composers, but nothing of the range available to the violin, piano or cello. Why did he not choose one of those?
Mr Bream now lives in a rural corner of Dorset, and he admitted from there that the guitar ""is limited to some extent in great pieces. A lot of it is quite pleasant, but it's not very intellectually conceived. It's music for pleasure."" Having said that, he manages to make his favourite pieces, such as Manuel de Falla's ""Homenaje"", completely satisfying by any standard. ""De Falla wrote 'Homenaje' in memory of Debussy. I've always considered it the most beautiful piece written for the guitar. It evokes all of what the guitar can express.""
His relationship with Spain and Spanish music is ambiguous. Although he frequently performs in Spain and is an expert on the repertoire there, he has never troubled to learn Spanish. ""I like to keep my distance from things I love"", he explains. ""If you're too close, too much part of the locale, it's harder to see things from a different perspective. Debussy wrote some of the best Spanish music, and he went there only once, on a four-hour bus trip. He saw one bullfight, was horrified, and never went back.""
Nevertheless, Mr Bream has for years pursued a different type of quest for authenticity, when modern composers have written works with him in mind. One such is Benjamin Britten's ""Nocturnal"", which the player qualifies as the ""second-most-beautiful work"" crafted for his instrument. ""Britten took tremendous care with that piece. It was so beautifully written that all I had to do was to play it. Britten was a very fastidious man about how his music should sound.""
The same was true of William Walton, who wrote two works for Mr Bream, one a song cycle to be played with Peter Pears singing. The recording of that piece urgently needs reissue from the Bertelsmann Music Group, which owns RCA now. So do two legendary recitals of lute songs, also with Pears, in which the tenor and accompanist play through a group of Elizabethan melodies with unearthly race, vivacity and musicianship. ""I always had a close affinity with Peter Pears,"" Mr Bream explains.
He was a wonderful musician. In those days, musicians were musicians and singers were something else, but Pears was an exception. If the composer of a piece is at your elbow, your performance can be much more authentic. But in anonymous works, you must use your intuition. If it sounds good, it must be right. With Peter Pears, instinct and a sense of style and a sense of pace were capital. Lots of modern performances of early music involve a good amount of musicological thought. But in the 1950s and 1960s, one did it in a much less studied way, more intuitively.
Mr Bream is not the sort to shed tears over bygone days, although he is unequivocally against the electric guitar, which he himself played during army service, in a dance band. ""I have no feelings or yearnings towards the electric guitar. It's useful, but I don't like the sound, it's a non-sound. Jimi Hendrix was a remarkable player but the sound is still awful. The electric guitar has the most boring sound of all--there's no impact, all the notes inflect in the same way. It's hardly poetic.""
Part of the problem seems to be that new generations are being raised with little or no idea of making music by themselves. It is a pity, Mr Bream thinks,
that music is now switched on. I think the potential for people to play and enjoy playing as amateurs is very much reduced, since we all have the ability to flip a disc and hear a fine performance...A CD is very much ironed out and perfect--that isn't music. Music is how you do it, a personal approach. It's what comes alive that is interesting. I like lively things, of the present moment. I used to play the cello very badly, but I'd enjoy playing Haydn quartets in evening chamber-music sessions. I played lots of wrong notes, but I had lots of joy.
Some years ago, Mr Bream was involved in a car accident. Although it left no lasting ill-effects, it seems to have accentuated his meditative turn of mind. He spent much time reading works by Pierre Tailhard de Chardin, a French theologian. ""I got a fascinating sense of time and space and how minuscule our lives are. I got a wonderful feeling of dimension."" These reflections, mulled over in Dorset, seem to have led to practical musical applications even in unlikely cases, such as the works of Heitor Villa-Lobos, a Brazilian composer whom Mr Bream met in Paris:
Villa-Lobos was larger than life, quite extraordinary. He didn't seem to be a composer. He wore loud checked shirts, smoked a cigar, and always kept the radio on, listening to the news or light music or whatever. Villa-Lobos wasn't refined in the intellectual sense, but he had a great heart. He was very critical of the way I played his pieces. He slowed me down, 'Not so fast!'...These days we live so quickly, speed seems very much a part of our modern ethos. We don't pause to reflect. Quietness makes us nervous, but to play Brazilian music, you really must have a reflective soul. That's why I live in the country. You need quietness and space.
One man facing down modern society armed only with a guitar might seem too Quixotic, and thus too Spanish, for Mr Bream. At a recent concert, a young woman in the audience remarked ""Why, he looks like a butler!"" If she meant that the courtly musician appeared to be the perfect gentleman's gentleman, then she might have been near the truth."

It was all caught on video, and one day the trial and execution of Romania's most infamous couple will probably take up a room of its own in Bucharest's National History Museum. But not yet.
To this day no one knows the full truth about the Romanian revolution of Christmas 1989, which claimed more than 1,000 lives. Museum officials think that ""because people are still alive"", they are justified in stopping history at 1945. Perhaps, ""in a few years"", they will change their minds. But in the tough post-communist world it is lack of money, rather than fear of handling political hot potatoes, that keeps Romania's modern history behind closed doors.
George Trohani, deputy director of the museum, comes to work in a ski-suit. There is no money for heat. ""We do have a photocopier,"" he says, ""but it broke."" A legion of fur-hatted women put down their knitting and rush to turn on the lights when visitors (rare birds) are spotted. But anyone seeking enlightenment on anything after about 1920 will have to wait--or cough up 1,000 lei ($4), the equivalent of a month's salary, to see Romanian history's forbidden rooms.
Room 44, which is locked, contains the Ceausescu pictures. Once they graced whole galleries. The revolution put the museum curators in a quandary. What should they do with several hundred pictures of Mr and Mrs Ceausescu, in oils, inlaid in wood, in tapestry, surrounded by flowers, surrounded by children, surrounded by flags? They could have destroyed them like many a joyous Romanian, but would it have been the responsible thing for a history museum to do? Probably not. So, pending the decisions of a special parliamentary commission (and some money), they stay stacked in historical limbo. ""I suppose they'll be valuable in 20 years' time,"" sighs Mr Trohani. He notes that not a few sheepish artists have come slinking around the museum, making embarrassed and unsuccessful bids to buy back their pictures.
In the next locked room lies another treasure trove of historical odds and ends: the (dusty) golden throne of Romania's dilettante and authoritarian pre-war monarch, Carol II; photographs of Communist gatherings, transferred from the defunct Museum of Communist Party History; the passports of Romanian statesmen; even the railway season ticket of Nicolae Iorga, a famous historian and politician who was assassinated by fascists in 1940.
According to Mr Trohani, the museum's budget is so slim that it can barely survive. But some of his dilemmas are not dissimilar to those now faced by factory managers in the industrial belt around Bucharest. Despite the lack of visitors, all 180 employees are still considered essential. In order to pay them, the museum has toyed with increasing the paltry entrance fee; but then even fewer people would come. While it waits for something to turn up, the National History Museum treads water. ""We are Romania in miniature"", says Mr Trohani."

A ""double-dip"" recession, with the second dip possibly worse than the first; crumbling international competitiveness in industries crucial for long-term growth; an economy hobbled by a naive commitment to ""free trade"", while competitors play by rules of their own. Sapped of strength at home and conspired against abroad, America is failing. This amounts to a national emergency, no less. Something must be done.
To outsiders the image looks hopelessly distorted. But, you might ask, what else is new? Economic paranoia has become an American habit. For the past 20 years America has watched other economies, notably Japan, narrow its lead in living standards, and most of the time has complained. That has not stopped it from growing richer, at a rate that is disappointing only by the standards of the comparative handful of countries that are close to catching up. America worries as it prospers. So be it.
The trouble is that in recent months these fears have become so intense that they threaten to do real, not imaginary, harm. This time, for once, the demands for something to be done may actually result in something being done--and in all likelihood that will be a setback. An emergency budget package to revive the economy; a tougher line on trade, especially with Japan; new policies to rebuild the industries that have been unfairly disadvantaged in the past. These and other false remedies are not merely, as always, being pressed by Washington lobbies that exist for no other purpose. At the beginning of 1992, they stand an ominously good chance of being tried. That is why it is urgent for America to look carefully at its true economic strengths and weaknesses, and to think hard about the proper goals of economic policy.
THE FEAR OF FEAR ITSELF
Confusion is helping to feed the present mood of despair--a confusion caused because two sorts of economic worry have been run together. The first concerns the short term: how far might the economy fall in the current recession? The second looks further ahead: what price will America have to pay for its failure to compete in international markets? Taken separately, these fears are based on false premises and are greatly overdone. Lumped together--as when cyclical changes are offered as proof that America is in chronic decline, or when the recession is blamed on foreigners' trade policies--they have caused a spurious and potentially destructive panic.
Start with the recession. From the tone of most recent commentary, you would conclude that it has been ferocious. In fact, measured by the decline in output since its peak in 1990, or by the rise to date in unemployment, it has been unusually mild. True, you would also conclude from your reading that the recession has hardly started, and that much worse is on its way. In fact, the recovery may already have begun. It is worth remembering that almost every previous upturn was signaled by a conviction among the experts that the fall in output was accelerating and that an end to recession had moved out of sight. Officials of the Federal Reserve, Wall Street pundits, distinguished academics and, regrettably, The Economist have all been regularly caught out in this way (see page 24). (Page 24 omitted).
There are good reasons to think that the coming expansion may be weaker than most of its predecessors; the mildness of the recession that preceded it is the main one. And the danger of a worsening slump cannot be ruled out, least of all in an economy which so delights in talking itself into trouble. Yet signs of recovery are there for those who would see--in recent months' figures for construction, durable goods' orders, share prices, the money supply, bank reserves and indices of leading indicators. The recent rally in the dollar is itself a sign that the financial markets have scented the upturn.
Yet Congress and the White House are preparing to abandon their hard-won budget accord in order to stimulate the economy with tax cuts and increases in public spending--changes in policy that will, in any case, take months to work through to output and employment. That budget accord was agreed to during an earlier panic over the size of the government's deficit. For George Bush, its price was steep: the humiliation of having to break his promise not to raise taxes. Despite its political cost, the accord proved inadequate to the task. In the current fiscal year, the deficit is expected to be roughly $350 billion, compared with the pact's (non-binding) target of $317 billion. Most of the rise in the deficit since 1990 is due to the recession, but there has been a rise in the underlying deficit too.
Now, it seems, Congress and the White House may agree to cast aside their flimsy instrument for curbing the deficit. In negotiating a fiscal package to reflate the economy, they may also decide to unravel the Tax Reform Act of 1986. If so, another flawed but worthwhile piece of economic legislation will be torn up for no good purpose. Some argue, despite this, that a properly designed fiscal initiative need do no long-term harm. What matters, they say, is to make sure that its effects are temporary and that nothing happens to increase the underlying deficit. In other words, it will be all right as long as the package is designed by a right-minded economist rather than by a Republican president squabbling with a Democrat-controlled Congress in an election year. This year's bold fiscal initiative is all too likely, by 1993, to have turned into that year's intractable economic problem; and fiscal policy will itself have rejoined the queue for emergency remedies.
The irony is that America's inability to restrain public borrowing is one of the country's main economic handicaps. By rushing in with needless short-term measures, politicians and lobbyists will make America's loner-term economic problems worse. Here too, however, it is important to see these difficulties as they really are. The present despair over America's ability to compete in the world economy is utterly misconceived.
AMERICA THE STRONG
Over the past five years the volume of America's manufactured exports has nearly doubled; over the same period the volume of exports from other industrial countries went up, on average, by a quarter. As a result, America's share of the OECD's manufactured exports increased from 14% in 1987 to an estimated 18% in 1991. The fall of the dollar since the mid-1980s helped, but so too did a fact that is less well-known: the American economy is much the most efficient user of manpower (see page 65). (Page 65 omitted). Measured across the whole economy, it is about twice as productive as Japan. Even measured across manufacturing, where Americans fear they are being thrashed, it is roughly as productive as Japan overall, and retains a clear lead in many industries. American firms continue to dominate most of the businesses that embody leading-edge technologies, such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, aerospace, computers and new materials.
Committed pessimists and those lobbying for government hand-outs will at once reply that all this is changing. Japan is catching up and before long will overtake; South Korea and a following army of Asian unfair traders are close behind. But consider this: in itself, catch-up is not merely natural but desirable--even to the country whose lead is diminishing. Japan's ability to make cars and videos that are good and cheap has made America and the other importers of those goods better off. Fierce competition from abroad not only means better, cheaper products to consume; it is also a spur to production, because it promotes innovation and efficiency, and shifts resources to better uses. If that looks like sophistry, cast an eye over Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, whose producers long enjoyed protection from unfair competition, all the zero-cost capital for investment they could use, and governments bold enough to engage in carefully co-ordinated industrial strategies. My, how they thrived.
The narrowing of America's industrial lead is not in itself a cause for alarm--but it is worth paying attention to, if it indicates that the American economy is doing less well than it might be. Undoubtedly, successful as it is, it could do much better. American businesses are investing far too little in their future. At only 9% of national income, they spend less than half as much as Japan each year on new capital, and roughly one-third less than Germany. And America has to struggle with several burdens that would crush a weaker economy: an outlandishly wasteful and expensive health-care industry; a legal system that acts as a heavy tax on American business; and an education system that leaves too many children unequipped for work.
These are the issues that policy-makers need to tackle. The two best ways to boost investment would be to bring the budget deficit under control (because that would raise the national saving rate and lower the cost of long-term capital) and make a firm commitment to low inflation. In their present mood, Congress and the White House consider the first counter-productive and the second irrelevant. As for health care and so on, these will have to wait (as always): they call for long-term solutions, not, as the times demand, emergency remedies.
What the times really demand is economic leadership, which raises questions about the timber of the man in the White House (see pages 19-21). (Pages 19-21 omitted). America needs a president who can respond to misguided gloom with calm proposals to promote long-term growth. Instead it has Mr Bush, who has surrendered to panic and is making things worse."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224138711/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/2?accountid=14657,"The outbreak of war in Yugoslavia came as a shock; the outbreak of peace seems almost unbelievable. It is precarious, admittedly. But, after six months of dithering, the European Community this week recognised Croatia and Slovenia; the latest ceasefire has held longer than any of its 14 predecessors; and the first UN peacekeepers have arrived (see page 48). (Page 48 omitted). Whether the whole Balkan war is now over, or just the first phase, it is time to ask a simple question: who won?
From the start, it was an uneven struggle. The Serbs had a fully equipped army and air force behind them, plus warships to blockade and pound ports like Dubrovnik. The Croats lacked weapons and training. Their air power consisted of crop-sprayers. They lost control of perhaps a third of Croatian territory. The imbalance of military force was abundantly clear in the siege and eventual fall of Vukovar in November.
Yet what is now emerging is hardly a Serb victory; it may be a Serb defeat. The Serbs' war aims have varied according to which Serbs stated them. The aims have been either (a) to keep the old Yugoslavia together, or (b) to carve out a Greater Serbia, including large chunks of Croatia, and/or (c) to inherit the international assets and club memberships of the rump Yugoslav state. Failure looms on all counts. Yugoslavia has now formally come to bits. Greater Serbia risks losing not only the Serb-occupied bits of Croatia but also the would-be independent republics of Bosnia and Macedonia. And it is increasingly uncertain that the world will go on recognising any sort of rump Yugoslavia.
How have the Serbs managed to translate their military gains into political losses? Afraid of opinion in the West, they shrank from all-out war. Instead they waged a hesitant campaign that left time for the Croats to organise a serious defence--and time for anti-war sentiment to swell in Serbia itself. Growing numbers of people there came to feel that this was ""not their war"". Draft-dodging and desertions from the Serb-dominated federal army grew by the week. It became clear that the army could not hold all the Croatian territory it had occupied. A retreat from some areas began. With the EC threatening to recognise independent-minded Yugoslav republics, Serbia faced diplomatic isolation and relegation to the Saddam Hussein league of international popularity. Under military, political and diplomatic pressure, Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, sued for a UN-sponsored peace.
All this has left Mr Milosevic in deep and deserved trouble. On only one count might he plausibly claim success: that Serb enclaves in Croatia have not been abandoned to Croat control. Many thousands of Croats have been driven out, leaving the areas more Serb than ever (which is why a defeat for Serbia does not amount to a victory for Croatia). Under the UN plan, peacekeepers will move in as the federal army withdraws from these areas, whose future status will be decided later. But the Serb barons in Croatia are accusing Mr Milosevic of ""betrayal"". Some sort of autonomy for the enclaves might well have been obtainable from the start through negotiation.
TOO SOON TO CELEBRATE
In all other respects, the war has created havoc for Serbia. It has lost most of its friends in the West. It risks losing Bosnia and Macedonia. Its tottering economy has been pushed close to collapse. It is having to cope with more than 100,000 refugees, many of whom are now asking angrily why they have had to sacrifice so much to achieve so little.
Is the moral of the story so far that, after all, aggression does not pay? It would be nice to think so. For a while it looked as if the Serb strategy might work: grab land, then wait for the world to come to terms with the new reality, which in time (Serb hardliners calculated) it surely would. That threatened to set an unhappy example for other troubled parts of Eastern Europe. As it turns out, no East European can now see the Serbs' strategy as a model for success. The one good thing that might result from the war is the fall of the Milosevic regime, with its brutal communist instincts, and its replacement by a democratic government. Had Serbia been more of a democracy all along Yugoslavia's break-up--perhaps even its conversion into a loose confederation--might have been no more turbulent than the dissolution of the Soviet Union has so far been.
But such optimism is dangerous in the Balkans. An aggrieved Serbia full of bitter refugees and disoriented officers does not exactly lend itself to democracy. Nor does a Croatia bent on reimposing control over all its territory. And an end to the war (if it really is over) is not the same as a lasting peace.
The future of the Serb enclaves in Croatia now has to be bargained over, against a background of hatred, refugees' grievances and the unrelenting belligerence of the local Serb warlords; here are all the makings of a terror-ridden Ulsterslavia. Conflict looms over ethnically mixed Bosnia and Macedonia, which the EC decided not to recognise this week-supposedly because they lacked Croatia's credentials on things like the treatment of minorities but really because they lacked Croatia's political clout. Serbia has failed in its power play, but the Balkans are still hewn from dynamite."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224174648/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/3?accountid=14657,"Few institutions have fought change as hard as Lloyd's, London's insurance market. Despite scandals, shrinking market share, and (recently) whopping losses, it has stuck determinedly to its 300-year-old traditions: reliance for capital on rich individuals (""names"") who accept unlimited liability for losses in the hope of making large profits; heavy dependence on business from the British and American markets; underwriters who wait in their boxes to fill in by hand the slips that brokers bring them. It seemed that nothing short of disaster could jolt Lloyd's into new thinking.
Evidently disaster looms, for the Council of Lloyd's has been quick to support most of the radical reforms suggested by a task force that reported on January 15th (see page 79). (Page 79 omitted). The biggest immediate change proposed is a cap on names' potential losses, beyond which a central fund would pay the bill. This neatly draws the sting of unlimited liability without formally scrapping it. If liability were limited under English company law, individuals could no longer join Lloyd's as sole traders who pay in only a part of their capital and enjoy tax advantages. Lloyd's does not want to lose such investors.
Equally radical, but less immediate, are two other suggestions by the task force. One is to amend the 1982 Lloyd's Act to allow corporate members with limited liability to join syndicates alongside names. The other is to allow trading of syndicate memberships, making them more like shares in a company. These changes should improve both the flow of capital into the market and its allocation. The task force also repeats many of the valid points that feature in most reports on Lloyd's. It argues, for example, for a determined effort to win business in continental Europe and east Asia, and for using technology and tougher management to cut the market's costs.
These reforms are designed to discourage names from resigning and to induce more to join. Yet there are reasons for doubting that they will be enough. For one thing, the task force stopped short of recommending several desirable changes that ought to be included in any new Lloyd's Act. These include converting from three-year to annual accounts; giving syndicates a continuing life instead of the present notion of winding them up each year; separating the members' agents that act for names from the managing agents that represent underwriters; and putting Lloyd's under the Financial Services Act to give names the same protection as other private investors.
LOSSES UNLIMITED
Another worry is that the Council of Lloyd's has been quick to reject the task force's proposals for modernising the tired array of committees that run the market. A new system of management is needed to ensure that the reforms succeed. The danger is that the council will adopt the easy short-term palliatives but, thanks to its institutional weakness, fail to push the tougher medium-term changes that Lloyd's needs.
Current names will have a bigger complaint: that the task force has done nothing about past losses. Names are facing huge losses for the four underwriting years from 1988 to 1991. By 1994 a majority of names will be locked into ""open-year"" syndicates, those with liabilities that are too unpredictable for their accounts to be closed. The task force's only balm for them is to suggest that individual names should be able to pay a central insurer controlled by Lloyd's to take on open-year liabilities--but the price, determined by a wary market, would in many cases be prohibitive.
The task force was right not to suggest changing the rules to help out names who have already suffered losses. Nothing could be better calculated to deter new investors than the fear that they might have to pick up the bill for old ones. Names should have known the risks they were taking when they accepted unlimited liability. Yet now that they know that outside help is unlikely, names will probably step up the litigation that has already begun against underwriters, agents and the corporation of Lloyd's itself. This could discourage policy-holders as well as prospective names.
The prospect of continuing uncertainty over the market's viability puts more stress on what could be the most crucial question of all: whether Lloyd's can look forward to a decade of profits to compensate for recent losses. There are a few favourable signs: big rises in rates for marine and aviation risks, some shrinkage of excess capacity both within and outside Lloyd's. The market's 1960s losses were followed by bumper profits. At least 1992 should be profitable.
There is, however, little hint of an end to America's liability lunacy. An Alaskan jury recently awarded $60m in punitive damages against a Lloyd's syndicate that had disputed a $300,000 claim for a restaurant fire. Insurers are increasingly being held liable for the costs of cleaning up pollution, even when the mess was made, legally, 40 years ago. Lloyd's is not the only sufferer; 225 American property and casualty insurers have one bust since 1984. If American legislators and judges continue to expect insurers to shoulder the entire burden for the sins of the past, even the most sensible reforms will not be able to save Lloyd's--or the rest of the insurance industry."

Algeria's army staged its coup to cancel that country's--and, save for the odd experiment, the Arab world's--first democratic parliamentary election for the rotten reason that it was about to be won by the ""wrong"" people, the Islamic fundamentalist party. This was a bad decision. Algeria itself now faces an indefinite period of civil strife; the drift towards democracy, which is catching on in all corners of the globe, has hit a serious tripwire; non-democrats alone should cheer.
Yet it was right to be apprehensive of the Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS. With its top men in prison after the riots last June, the movement remains divided between militant and pragmatic factions. But it speaks openly about its desire to transform Algeria into the sort of ""Islamic state"" that takes all its rules from the Koran. Before the coup, the party's wilder members made no secret of their scorn for the democracy that was serving them so well. It was far from certain that the party, once voted in, would have let itself be voted out.
This was the fear, but it was not proven. President Chadli Benjedid, who had instigated the democratic reforms, appears to have believed that constitutional checks and balances offered him the chance to contain a FIS victory. And if this did not work--if the fundamentalists pushed for more power than was rightfully theirs--the bludgeon of the armed forces would be in reserve. He is said to have had talks with the FIS's acting leader, Abdel Kader Hashani, on a framework for cohabitation. It was a risk, but not a foolhardy one.
The country's military leaders, thinking otherwise, got rid of the president. Mr Chadli's resignation, brought about by pressure from the triumvirate of the minister of defence, the minister of the interior and the chief of staff, provided a measure of legitimacy for the cancellation of the elections and what is, in effect, a takeover by the army. Improvising with bits and pieces of constitutional camouflage, the generals have set up a series of councils; the strong man on these bodies remains the minister of defence, Khaled Nezzar. Algeria is no more than a step from martial law.
The sadness is not only for Algeria. Arab countries have been slower than others to be infected by the democratic bug. Many of them are not fortunate in their rulers: authoritarian monarchs, tyrannical soldiers, corrupt coteries protected by ferocious security services. For those states lucky enough to be sitting on oil, however, there has been enough money to keep most of the people happy most of the time. And the West, because of this oil, has been more concerned to bolster the region's stability than to urge unpredictable democracy.
PUT THEM TO THE TEST
Several countries have from time to time dipped their toes into elections--Lebanon, Kuwait and Jordan more seriously than most. But Algeria was alone in deciding to hold an open multiparty election for a parliament that is supposed to have a serious say in running the country. Governments that purport to be going the same way, but at the pace of a three-legged camel, accuse Mr Chadli of being precipitate; he should, they argue, have allowed more time for people to form convincing secular parties (the National Liberation Front, which won independence from France in 1962, has turned itself into a seedy historical monument).
But when would the time be ripe? Discontent was accentuated when the oil price sagged, affecting countries that serve the Arab oil states as well as the oil-rich themselves. Suddenly there were fewer circuses and less bread. Islamic fundamentalists, seeing their chance, seized it. The fear, after Iran's explosion in 1979, was that the fierce clerics of Shia Islam would light revolutionary fires. This did not happen. But militants in the majority Sunni faction were better able to attract the loyalty of unhappy Muslims everywhere. The dispossessed rallied to their urgent populist message, attacking incompetent regimes and their western sponsors. True, the men of God know no better than anybody else how to deal with unemployment, wretched living conditions and punishing foreign debts, but their ignorance has not, so far, been put seriously to the test.
Arab governments have responded in various ways to the Islamic knock at their door. Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood was born 64 years ago, alternates oppression with privilege; one moment militants are being tortured, the next feted. Tunisia and Morocco prefer straight repression. Syria resorted to slaughter. Saudi Arabia, which before the Gulf war financed many of the fundamentalist groups, now finds itself tormented by its own purer-than-pure faction. And one military regime--Sudan's--is under the brutal thumb of a fundamentalist faction and its charismatic leader.
The Jordanians, who like the Egyptians allowed the fundamentalists to compete (and do well) in elections to their not very important parliament, believe that responsibility has drawn the militants' sting. This may be the answer. So long as there are poor and rich--and until Islamic militants have had the chance to show that they too do not know how to turn the former into the latter--their message will continue to beguile. But once the militants are inside a system of government, as they are in Pakistan, Malaysia and Turkey, their appeal can be circumscribed. As outsiders they can only be spoilers.
Democracy is no guarantee of good government; it is merely the least bad system yet devised. The shame is that Algeria, which so courageously embarked on its democratic experiment, has now given undemocratic opposition groups the chance to argue that democracy is a privilege to be doled out in coffee spoons--and strictly limited to the politically correct."

By that yardstick, Germany's Bundesbank, a renowned party-pooper, is the best of all. Since it raised its discount rate in December, to its highest since the second world war, Bundesbank-bashing has become the rage. A bashing is richly deserved--but it is the German government and Germany's trade unions that should be bashed, not the central bank.
Germany's partners in the European monetary system lead the chorus of complaint, because all but Britain have had to raise interest rates to support their own currencies, even though their sluggish economies suggest that rates should be cut. The Bundesbank is also disliked by the Bush administration, which wants other governments to try to revive the world economy. East Germans complain that the Bundesbank's monetary squeeze is preventing their region from recovering, while western Germany has been snowed in by Angst this winter. The west German economy has slowed sharply, with output flat or falling during the past nine months. Surely, say businessmen and politicians, the Bundesbank should now be loosening its monetary grip, not tightening it.
The critics are missing the point. It is not the Bundesbank's job to steer the real economy; its sole responsibility is for price stability. The Bundesbank law correctly reconises that, in anything but the very short term, low inflation is not an alternative to growth, but a condition for its sustainability. And the Bundesbank has good reason to remain worried about inflation: consumer prices rose by 4.2% in the course of last year, double the Bundesbank's medium-term target of 2%, and the rate is expected to edge higher this spring.
The Bundesbank has three concerns. First, it is one of the few OECD central banks that is still troubled by too much, rather than too little, monetary growth, partly as a result of liquidity boosted by unification. Second, the Bundesbank is anxious to prevent a wage-price spiral. After average earnings increased by 7% in 1991, some trade unions have put in double-digit claims for 1992. By raisin interest rates, the Bundesbank has warned employers that it will not accommodate big wage rises by allowing faster monetary growth. If firms grant rises of more than 5%, say, then Germany will indeed have a real recession, with higher unemployment.
Last, but not least, the Bundesbank has had to run a tighter monetary policy in order to offset the federal government's fiscal policy. The huge increase in the budget deficit, to pay for the rebuilding of eastern Germany, represents the biggest fiscal stimulus made by any OECD government during the past decade. Germany's public-sector deficit rose to around 4% of its GNP last year, from rough balance in 1989. If the borrowing of the Treuhandanstalt, the east German privatisation agency, and other off-budget items are added in, the true budget deficit is closer to 7% of GNP--twice as big as America's deficit at its peak. Worse still, the German deficit looks unlikely to shrink as fast as the government had been counting on, because forecasts for east German tax revenues now seem too optimistic.
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MORNING AFTER
Bringing East Germany into the market economy was always going to be expensive. But the government is financing the task in the worst way, by raisin taxes rather than by cutting spending in western Germany. It plans, for example, to increase VAT from 14% to 15% in January 1993. Higher taxes could damage Germany's competitiveness, and, worse still, they risk trapping the economy in a vicious circle. They will push up inflation and wage claims, which may force the Bundesbank to keep interest rates high, so further denting growth; which in turn will push the budget deficit higher still, requiring the government to raise taxes by even more. There is a simple, though politically tricky, way out. Government subsidies in the west for transport, coal and other undeserving causes amount to 6% of GNP. This is were the government needs to wield its axe. So far it has barely used a razor blade.
As long as the government remains so timid, a lot of misplaced blame will fall on the Bundesbank. That carries perils of its own, for the world's most independent central bank won its anti-inflationary credibility over many years; it could lose it overnight if it starts to go soft. Its sound-money reputation gives it more room for manoeuvre than other central banks, which in the past has enabled it to fight inflation at a lower cost in terms of job losses. By acting decisively now, it will not need to keep interest rates high for long, and so will do less lasting damage to the economy.
Meanwhile, it remains in the long-term interests of Germany and its EC partners that the D-mark remains a stable, low-inflation currency. By taking away the beer barrel, the Bundesbank may seem to be spoiling the fun today. But it is saving Germany and Europe from a nasty hangover tomorrow."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139427/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/6?accountid=14657,"What ought to have been the worst of times for the world's renegade bomb-builders are in danger of becoming the best of times. Just as the shock of what Saddam Hussein has been up to in Iraq is about to produce tighter controls on the spread of bomb-making technology and know-how, Soviet fission and post-Soviet confusion have given nuclear cheats a new boost. One freelance attempt to sell Russian plutonium abroad has already been thwarted. Libya has offered tempting contracts to Russian nuclear scientists. Iran may have snapped up a couple of tactical nuclear warheads at bargain prices in the Central Asian arms bazaar. New problems like these demand novel solutions. But they should not come at the expense of older ways of thwarting the proliferators.
Among the novelties so far, George Bush has offered $400m towards the cost of scrapping nuclear weapons made redundant by the START agreement on strategic weapons, or else cut unilaterally since. Fine, but dismantling weapons and warheads is a slow business. In the meantime, disabling the weapons, especially the thousands of tactical nuclear warheads whose physical security causes greatest concern, could be done quickly and cheaply by removing their fuses. Those ex-Soviet states happy to co-operate in a checkable way in such a venture could expect to come first in the queue for other sorts of western help. Any tempted to hang on to usable weapons should get no help. Other ideas, such as ""buying"" redundant bombs, could be a mistake, because they might encourage governments to auction weapons off to the highest bidder.
But keeping usable bombs out of unauthorised hands is only part of the problem. Even more worrying is the prospect of a new generation of nuclear powers. The North Koreas and Irans, which are secretly making the bomb (not to mention Israel, India and Pakistan, which already have it), would be delighted if nuclear materials, designs, equipment or skills of the old Soviet nuclear-weapons industry were to fall into their lap.
Most of the new Commonwealth (ex-Soviet) states have said they will sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and all have agreed not to trade in nuclear weapons or in the wherewithal to make them. Yet there is bound to be some leakage. Nobody can stop weapons scientists taking up shady work abroad (Iraq seemed to find plenty even before the Soviet collapse). At best, incentives for Russia's scientists to stay put--funds to work on the dismantling and clean-up of nuclear weapons plants, for example--could be combined with the threat that anyone who helps the illicit bomb-makers will be banned from reputable laboratories the world over. For the rest, controls on exports are for governments to devise and police. The new governments of the non-Russian republics have no experience of either, leaving plenty of scope for expert advice and assistance.
Emergency measures can help plug sudden leaks. But the most effective barriers to illicit bomb-making remain the system of checks carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and internationally agreed export controls (Germany's latest admission that some of its companies supplied equipment for uranium enrichment to Iraq shows how much more needs to be done to enforce them). Both sets of controls are being tightened.
France and China, the two declared nuclear powers still outside the NPT, have agreed to join. Next month the IAEA is to consider tougher monitoring rules. The nuclear frisking of Iraq was specially authorised by the UN Security Council. Otherwise, IAEA inspectors have poked about only at times and in places of the host government's choosing. ""Special"" inspections, allowed for in the IAEA's charter, have never been used. If safeguards are to work better, they must in future include challenge inspections of suspect sites at short notice, and more frequent regular inspections. Nuclear facilities, not just reactor fuels, need to be monitored. And the IAEA should be notified of new nuclear facilities at the planning stage, instead of waiting until they are almost ready for start-up. Suspected cheats should be named and quarantined.
PENNY-WISE, BOMB-FOOLISH
No system of checks is fool-proof. But the tighter they are, the harder and more expensive it will be to evade them. Even with inadequate checks, Iraq had to spend upwards of $10 billion and more than ten years in its quest to build a bomb. Yet driving up the costs of proliferation is itself a costly business. The IAEA's safeguarding budget of only $75m a year is woefully inadequate to keep tabs on new technologies, cope with the expansion of safeguards to new NPT members, from South Africa to the new Commonwealth, and carry out the thorough and more frequent inspections needed.
More money spent on better controls will help deter future proliferators. But North Korea is already worryingly close to having a bomb. If it is allowed to get away with it, Iran, Algeria and Libya will keep trying. Worse, nearby South Korea, Japan and Taiwan all have the industrial capacity to go nuclear at speed. Unless the UN Security Council is prepared to defend the NPT as stoutly in North Korea as it is in Iraq, others will be tempted to tear up the treaty and defend themselves."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224142763/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/7?accountid=14657,"Barely three months ago, George Bush was master of all he surveyed. In the Gulf war America had shown itself able to project devastating military strength halfway around the globe against a minor power. Its only superpower challenger, the Soviet Union, was about to disintegrate. America's recovery from recession, though not assured, seemed on its way. How different Mr Bush looks today. Even before he collapsed in Tokyo on January 8th, his re-election to the White House was by no means a sure thing.
Opinion polls show that Americans, asked to choose between Mr Bush and ""any Democrat"" are about equally divided (though he beats, easily, all real Democrats who have declared their candidacy). He faces a challenge from a Republican, Pat Buchanan, who is mobilising parts of the conservative coalition that put Ronald Reagan into office in 1980. Enthusiasm for Mr Bush has evaporated. An old jibe, that support for him is a mile wide but an inch deep, is beginning to look uncomfortably close to the truth.
Why? One reason is that, although Mr Bush has been a prominent public figure for 20 years, Americans have little sense of who he is, where he comes from or what he believes. He often seems ready to adopt the characteristics and beliefs of those he is with at the time. If his black friends (of whom he has many) tell him that it is important that he should sign a civil-rights bill, he will say that such a bill is his highest priority. If his conservative friends (of whom also he has many) tell him that a civil-rights bill will lead to racial quotas in employment, he will say that he hates quotas worse than broccoli. Sometimes he seems to be a moderate Republican, much like the late Nelson Rockefeller; sometimes he looks happier parroting the economic and moral certitudes of Mr Reagan.
On one view, the obvious conclusion is that Mr Bush is a man who believes in nothing save that which will advance his cause; that he is driven by nothing but expediency; that he is a slave to public opinion rather than a leader of it. But there is another possibility: that he is ready, perhaps too ready, to consider all sides of a question, and that he thinks the job of those in government is to work out commonsense, pragmatic--he would say ""prudent""--compromises with which all can live. That is not an ignoble view of his calling. The right reaction to Mr Bush is not to sneer at his prudence, but to ask if it is sufficient to the times in which he finds himself America's president.
FROM KENNEBUNKPORT TO ODESSA
Bush-the-president is the product of two backgrounds--two versions of Bush-the-man--which at first sight seem to have little in common, but which are closer than is often allowed. To understand the first Bush-the-man, go to Kennebunkport, on the Maine coast, a New England resort where his mother's family owned a comfortable summer house--Walker's Point--with ten acres of land. This is where the president retires every August to fish and play golf; where he is a vestryman at the local Episcopalian church; and where old codgers, sunning themselves on the verandah of a hotel, will tell you that Mr Bush ""fits right in"".
This is where the legend of Bush-the-patrician takes form, the tale built on the truths that both sides of his family have money, that his father, Prescott Bush, was a Wall Street tycoon who became a senator from Connecticut, that young George was sent off to school at Phillips, Andover and then to Yale. Although his birthplace was in fact Milton, Massachusetts, it is looking at the Maine coast from Walker's Point that you can understand why Jim Hightower, a Democratic politician from Texas, once said that George Bush was ""born on third base and thought he'd hit a triple"".
But the idea that Mr Bush is only a patrician, only comfortable with old money and its values, will not stand scrutiny. For a start, there is ample testimony that Mr Bush's family was anything but stuck-up. He may have been raised in New England comfort, but nobody has ever been able to show that any member of the Bush or Walker families was a snob--and there were plenty in 1930s New England who were. When he plays golf at Kennebunkport, Mr Bush's partners are more likely to be local car salesmen than Wall Street brokers on holiday. Second, and more telling, look at Odessa, Texas, the town to which George Bush, wife and baby in tow, moved in the summer of 1947, after war service and graduation from Yale, to sell oil-drilling equipment.
Odessa is at the heart of the Permian Basin of west Texas, where oil was discovered in 1923. The summer heat is baking, the landscape so flat, so featureless, that it might be the setting for a post-Apocalypse film. Nothing much grows there except tumbleweed. Odessa is the blue-collar centre of the oil industry. It is the kind of place where, for want of anything else to do, 20,000 people turn out to watch high-school football. A novelist, Larry McMurtry, once called it ""the worst town on earth"".
Yet in Odessa, and in neighbouring Midland, where the Bush family moved in 1950, after an 18-month interlude in California, it is just as easy as in Kennebunkport to hear folk say that the Bushes ""fit right in"". In Texan, this means that the president ate chile, barbecued in the backyard, taught Sunday school and worked hard to make his way as an independent oilman.
So starts the second Bush legend, that of Bush-the-common-man. It is in the Permian Basin that you start to believe that Mr Bush really does, as this legend has it, like junk food; that his family matters more to him than anything else (it was in Midland that his three-year-old daughter fell fatally ill with leukaemia); that he distrusts intellectuals (not many of them in west Texas) and honours get-up-and-go capitalism. Yet though west Texas may have sharpened these attributes in Mr Bush's character, they were not freshly minted there; he learnt them in New England. He would not have been so popular in the Permian Basin if he had been stuffy, patrician or driven by an intellectual or ideological muse. Mr Bush has never been like that.
It was in Texas--where 40 years ago Republicans were rare--that Mr Bush started to think of a political career. By his own testimony he was by the early 1950s a conservative Republican, at least in economic matters. He has never doubted that government helps business best when it interferes with it least.
He neither received nor could have expected any political help from his father. When George Bush arrived in Texas, Prescott Bush was no more than a moderately well connected political figure (he did not enter the Senate until 1952, at the age of 57), and in the mid-1950s he crossed Big Oil by opposing natural-gas deregulation. In 1964, the year that the Republican ticket headed by Barry Goldwater was hammered nationwide, George Bush lost a race for the Senate. Two years later he was elected to the first of two terms in the House of Representatives from the prosperous west side of Houston, which was by then both his home and his business base.
GEORGE-OF-ALL-TRADES
There then followed four jobs in ten years. In 1970 he lost another Senate race, and was appointed ambassador to the United Nations by Richard Nixon. President Nixon then brought him back to Washington in 1972 to be chairman of the Republican Party. In 1974 Gerald Ford sent him to Beijing as ambassador, and in 1976 he started a year (which he loved) as director of the CIA.
Reports of his tenure of all four jobs tell of the same qualities: competence, attention to cordial personal relations, and an avoidance of controversy. The Republican Party, reeling from Watergate, was on the ropes. Mr Bush at least kept it from falling out of the ring. At the CIA, torn by revelations of dirty tricks, he restored a sense of pride (when he made his first visit as president to CIA headquarters, staff poured out of their offices to cheer him). He became known as a man who would take pride in doing his job well, but who at the same time would not break new ground. This reputation accompanied him throughout his eight years as Mr Reagan's vice-president.
His year at the CIA also confirmed his reputation for ambition, already evident in his pursuit of the UN ambassadorship and in an unsuccessful attempt to get President Ford to nominate him as vice-president. It was reconfirmed in his 1988 campaign for the White House, a vicious affair in which Mr Bush showed himself ready to pander cynically to whatever populist prejudice might bring him votes.
THE HOUR FINDS THE MAN
In a much-quoted analysis of Mr Bush's career, Nelson Polsby, of the University of California, argues that he ""is a genuine conservative, an American Tory. There are known characteristics of that breed: they care about the society and the government that is handed to them; they want to keep the boat afloat. Bush is a professional in public service, which means he has respect for other professionals. Conventional wisdom means something to him. He pays attention to people who are supposed to be experts."" To drive the point home, Mr Polsby concludes: ""These are qualities he does not share with his predecessor.""
By intention or not, that is something of a backhanded compliment. For the differences between Mr Bush and Mr Reagan lie not just, say, in the two men's attitude to professional public servants. A bigger difference is that Mr Reagan wanted to do something rather grander with the presidency than ""keep the boat afloat"". Mr Reagan's first term was, by its own lights, a brilliant success. He said he would cut taxes and deregulate the economy. In broad measure, he did. He said that he would face down the Soviet Union wherever it wanted a fight. A bloated defence establishment and wars by proxy in Nicaragua and Afghanistan were ample evidence that he meant it.
The Reagan style and the Reagan world--a world of good and evil, black and white, a world (at least for Mr Reagan's supporters) driven by ideas rather than commonsense--are not those of Mr Bush. The New England part of him must have found the Reaganauts meretricious, flashy, the epitome of new money. His Texas side must have found the southern Californian conservatism that Mr Reagan brought to Washington far too sure of itself, too rooted in the work of clever ideologists. Texans, who are good at laughing at themselves, looked askance at the dead-seriousness of Mr Reagan's young legionnaires. In the Reagan White House, arguments over policy turned quickly into screaming matches which ended in tears. It is hard to imagine that happening under Mr Bush.
In the first two years of his presidency, prudence and compromise were to some extent forced on him. At home, he faced a Congress in which neither house was controlled by his party. He seems certain to be only the second president (Mr Nixon was the first) who will spend his entire term of office, whether it be four years or eight, in that position; and the Democratic majority in Congress is much more cohesive today than it was in Mr Nixon's time. Even if Mr Bush were not by nature a compromiser, present-day American politics would compel him to be. Moreover, in the first two years of his presidency the American economy was still growing, if slowly. There was no pressing need for extraordinary domestic initiatives, and where there is no such need, Tories will not supply them.
Abroad, the sloganising about the Soviet Union which Mr Reagan had been able to get away with no longer sufficed. Mr Bush's America had to handle the real-world, shades-of-grey business of managing the decline of its superpower adversary without rubbing the Soviet Union's nose in its own failure. Reactive, flexible, not burdened with moral fervour, Mr Bush was well suited to this task too. Historians will admire the skill of America's European diplomacy in the year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when Germany was reunited with astonishingly little fuss. Again, the painstaking round of American diplomacy in the Middle East since the end of the Gulf war, though executed by James Baker, the president's secretary of state and alter ego, is pure Bush in style.
Seen in this light, Mr Bush's decision to face down Saddam Hussein after the invasion of Kuwait, to risk war and then wage it, was not so much the hallmark of his presidency as an aberration in it. It is, of course, possible to indulge in a little revisionism: to argue that the massive force he deployed in the Gulf was another manifestation of prudence, and that so too was his decision not to pursue the Iraqi president after the objectives of the war had been achieved. But this will not really do. As Richard Perle, who served in the Pentagon under President Reagan, has said, when Mr Bush drew his famous line in the sand in the summer of 1990, it was his own presidency he was putting on it. It was (remember how close the vote for war was in the Senate) a huge gamble.
Why did he gamble? The most convincing explanation is that there is an exception to the natural caution and search for compromise of American Tories of Mr Bush's age--he almost certainly will be the last American president who fought in the second world war--and it concerns territorial aggression.
Mr Bush was a genuine war hero. The youngest pilot in the American navy, he was shot down in the Pacific and picked up by a submarine. He went to war in the Pacific believing that the cause was just, and that America had a unique moral responsibility to deter aggression. In this respect, his sense of what the world expected of America was every bit as prophetic as Mr Reagan's (or, for that matter, as Woodrow Wilson's). He had precisely the same sense of the moral rightness of America's case in 1990-91. It enabled him to display qualities of leadership that surprised even his admirers.
HOME AGAIN
The cry now is for him to show the same leadership at home, to tackle America's undoubted domestic ills with the crusading zeal that he showed in the Gulf. At one level, this is a facile cry, and would be so even if Mr Bush's natural style were not that of prudence and compromise. The enemy in the Gulf was easily identified, and specific objectives easy to define. Domestic policy is not like that. You cannot, at any level but the rhetorical, wage a ""war"" on poverty. Who are you fighting? How do you know if you have won? You cannot, in a free society, marshal countless millions of autonomous economic agents as if they were so many infantrymen, and expect them to march behind a banner marked ""Increased Competitiveness"".
Domestic policy, in any country, is always about balancing competing interests. As Michael Deland, the chairman of the president's council on environmental quality, often points out, it is irresponsible (in fact, silly) to call for ""environmental protection"" without assessing what effect any example of such protection will have on economic activity.
Mr Bush's central problem is that, for many in America, the times do not call for such cool commonsense. This is not just because there is a recession. It is much more because Americans know in their bones that an era has ended. The old enemy is dead, the old certainties of the cold war lie shattered. The easy hegemony and easy wealth which Americans came to regard as their birthright are gone for good, as they were bound to go one day. America remains a strong and successful country. But random conversations with Americans, of whatever political persuasion, reveal that they know that many of their institutions, including perhaps their system of government, need renewing. Americans are as patriotic as ever, but they are not fools; they are not going to be fobbed off with some nonsense about a new morning in America.
It is not that Americans single out Mr Bush to take the blame for their recession or their trade deficit. But, as always--and to an extent that is not true of any other country--they look to their president for a lead; first, in honestly admitting that the country has hard work ahead of it, and then in suggesting what that work might be. And giving a lead is not Mr Bush's style.
If indeed he wins re-election, Mr Bush will have a couple of years in which to be candid with Americans, to ask them to make sacrifices, to save more and consume less, to work and study harder. This should be easier to do in America than any other country. Some of the cleavages that have dogged Europe--between those who believe in capitalism and those who don't, between those who think patriotism is fine and those who see it as the last refuge of the scoundrel--have passed America by. But it is unlikely that Mr Bush would be able to make such an appeal with conviction. His reaction to adversity is often not to lead opinion but to follow it, or at least to follow what pollsters and pundits tell him the public wants to hear. His trip to Japan this month could have been used for a well-planned joint exploration of global issues by the world's two economic superpowers. Mr Bush allowed it, at the last moment, to be turned into an extempore effort to sell his hosts more (left-hand-drive) cars--cars which are often a joke even among American consumers. This was expediency run riot, and it did him no good.
In the end, the doubt about George Bush is whether he has the courage to stick his neck out and provide the domestic leadership that America needs. The indications so far are that he does not. If that proves true in a second term, a man who has won, and largely deserved, the gratitude of the rest of the world for managing an internationally difficult time will, in the end, neither deserve nor win gratitude at home."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224162098/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/8?accountid=14657,"When the economy is growing, people look ambitiously up at the next run of the economic ladder. When they feel their grip on the ladder weakening, they tend to glance down at the safety net beneath them. In America the safety net certainly exists (which would be news to many Europeans), but it is peculiarly designed.
A combination of means-tested benefits for the poor and social insurance, largely for the elderly, ensures that the indigent and the aged are catered for. But for those who are merely unemployed, or ill, the safety net is a long way down; becoming poor, or old, is sometimes the only way to find it. The federal and state governments pay for the health care of the poor, via Medicaid, and of the elderly, via Medicare. But people in the middle of their working lives either get their health benefits through their jobs, or pay their own medical bills.
The same goes for income support. The poor qualify for a variety of state and federal programmes: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC-the programme known as ""welfare""), food stamps and a crazy quilt of other programmes. The elderly get social security (pensions). The not-so-poor and not-so-old can get unemployment benefits (which are averagely generous by western standards) for only 26 weeks. Recent legislation by Congress has stretched that by up to 20 weeks on an emergency basis--but in any case, only 38% of unemployed people have worked long enough to qualify for benefits at all. Those who have exhausted their unemployment pay, or who never qualified for it, face the prospect of running down their assets until they qualify for poverty programmes.
Ironically, the recession is nudging politicians into reversing the emphasis--enlarging the safety net for the middle-aged and middle-incomed, and reducing it for the poor. The extension of unemployment benefits for the lucky 38% and the growing political fashion for promising universal health care are signs of the popularity of programmes that give the bourgeoisie less far to fall. By contrast, the poor are fewer, more apathetic and more predictable in their voting habits. So, although more people are qualifying for the poverty programmes--almost a tenth of Americans now receive food stamps, and over 4.5m American families are on welfare--it is they who are seeing their benefits cut.
Conservative arguments that welfare benefits have created a class of people dependent on public assistance have bolstered reluctance among the public to pay higher taxes to support the poor. Now, as the recession causes welfare rolls to swell and tax revenues to shrink, many states--constrained by laws requiring them to balance their budgets--are cutting the amount they spend on welfare. Although AFDC payments account for just 3.4% of the average state's budget, and have fallen in real terms by an average of 42% over the past 20 years, they are a tempting target. (Entirely federal programmes like food stamps are much less vulnerable to budget-cutting, since the federal government can, notoriously, keep adding to the deficit.)
On January 13th New Jersey's Republican-controlled Senate approved a package of revisions to the state's welfare laws. The new law would cut off additional benefits to single mothers who have more children and curtail payments to welfare beneficiaries who refuse to undertake job training or further education. New Jersey's governor has yet to sign the law, which may in any case face legal challenges, but other states are heading in the same direction.
Wisconsin and Ohio already have experimental programmes to cut benefits to welfare recipients if they or their children fail to attend school. In California the state's governor, Pete Wilson, has proposed lopping $600m off the budget by reducing AFDC benefits by 10% initially and then by a further 15% for most of the beneficiaries who stay on welfare for over six months. Other programmes for the poor are also being cut. In 1991 13 states cut General Assistance, which is a much smaller programme than AFDC and which helps single adults; Michigan scrapped it altogether (see next story).
Although there is some liberal-conservative agreement on the desirability of linking welfare to job training--an idea embodied at the federal level in the 1988 Family Support Act--there is disagreement over cutting benefits. Many conservatives argue that such reforms are a long-overdue form of kindness-through-cruelty that will make the safety net more of a trampoline. Making a life on welfare less sustainable, they argue, will break a cycle of dependency that locks the poor into reliance on the state. Many liberals think such rhetoric simply prettifies an effort to balance budgets on the backs of the needy. Theodore Marmor, a professor of public policy at Yale University, says that ""America has moved from a war on poverty to a war on the poor.""
THE MIDDLE NET
It is no coincidence that the most vulnerable social programmes are those that benefit only a minority. Social-insurance programmes like pensions and Medicare eat up almost three times as much government money as benefits aimed specifically at the poor--but they are also far more popular because they benefit all Americans. Throughout the 1980s the mere mention of the voting power of the elderly was enough to see off attempts to reform social security, which now takes 28% of the federal budget and simply hands it to the old, whatever their incomes. Last year Richard Darman, the president's budget director, did float the idea of means-testing entitlements for the elderly, but nothing has come of it.
Attempts to cut or means-test social security are guaranteed to raise a political storm. Americans pay a national-insurance tax, and many believe the government is saving the money for their retirement. This is a misconception, since today's taxes are paying for today's pensioners or being spent on other goodies. Try telling that to an angry voter who thinks you are diddling him out of a comfortable old age.
Social security has undeniably achieved its main goal. Elderly Americans were once the most poverty-stricken group in the country; now they are the least likely to suffer from poverty. But the programme's very popularity is both a lure and a cautionary tale for American politicians who hope to supplement pensions-for-all with health-care-for all. Universal benefits are as costly as they are popular."

When they feel their grip on the ladder weakening, they tend to glance down at the safety net beneath them. In America the safety net certainly exists (which would be news to many Europeans), but it is peculiarly designed.
A combination of means-tested benefits for the poor and social insurance, largely for the elderly, ensures that the indigent and the aged are catered for. But for those who are merely unemployed, or ill, the safety net is a long way down; becoming poor, or old, is sometimes the only way to find it. The federal and state governments pay for the health care of the poor, via Medicaid, and of the elderly, via Medicare. But people in the middle of their working lives either get their health benefits through their jobs, or pay their own medical bills.
The same goes for income support. The poor qualify for a variety of state and federal programmes: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC--the programme known as ""welfare""), food stamps and a crazy quilt of other programmes. The elderly get social security (pensions). The not-so-poor and not-so-old can get unemployment benefits (which are averagely generous by western standards) for only 26 weeks. Recent legislation by Congress has stretched that by up to 20 weeks on an emergency basis--but in any case, only 38% of unemployed people have worked long enough to qualify for benefits at all. Those who have exhausted their unemployment pay, or who never qualified for it, face the prospect of running down their assets until they qualify for poverty programmes.
Ironically, the recession is nudging politicians into reversing the emphasis--enlarging the safety net for the middle-aged and middle-incomed, and reducing it for the poor. The extension of unemployment benefits for the lucky 38% and the growing political fashion for promising universal health care are signs of the popularity of programmes that give the bourgeoisie less far to fall. By contrast, the poor are fewer, more apathetic and more predictable in their voting habits.

THE DARKEST HOUR'S RELATIONSHIP TO DAWN
""Low interest rates have done nothing for the money supply...The economy, frighteningly, seems to be going its own way, shrugging off the help being doled out to it by the administration.""...""Whenever the upturn in the American economy comes it will not, according to even the most optimistic predictions, be before summer."" Those comments may sound contemporary, but The Economist wrote them in February and March of 1975. As it turned out, America's recession actually ended in March 1975, with real GNP rising by no less than 6.1% in the year to the first quarter of 1976.
The Bank Credit Analyst, a monthly publication on American financial markets, has been delving back into the archives. It concludes that businessmen, economists and journalists are typically still deeply gloomy as economic recovery gets underway. In November 1970, for example, Business Week said ""Business statistics of current activity look sour...There are few (businessmen) who expect an economic turnaround before the end of 1971."" As that was being written the recession reached its trough: GNP rose by 3.1% in the year to the fourth quarter of 1971.
Or take the early 1980s recession. Business Week fretted in November 1982: ""The battered economy isn't picking up yet. There are still very few signs that business activity is improving."" So when did the economy bottom out? November 1982, of course. Real GNP soared by 6.3% in the year to the fourth quarter of 1983.
This year, gloomy is once again the thing to be. There was a portent of that in the autumn, when the Philadelphia Inquirer ran a nine-part series with the snappy title ""America: What Went Wrong?"", but with the new year things have moved into top gear. Time magazine thinks that ""This recession is different. That is the raw, uncomfortable reality""; Newsweek speaks of the ""glooming of America""; US News and World Report serenaded 1992 with a cover story entitled ""Is your job safe?"".
People have clearly forgotten their gloom last time around. The dire economic prophecies that now abound in America may actually be a leading indicator of imminent recovery. But, just because recoveries happen when economists are still gloomy, the fact that economists are now gloomy does not prove that recovery has arrived."

Politicians often act as though the public expects them to break their promises. John Engler, the governor of Michigan for the past year, has surprised people by keeping many of his--at least so far. Almost alone among states with recessionary budget deficits, Michigan has cut spending and not raised taxes. That has made Mr Engler unpopular, but perhaps no more so than if he had done the opposite.
Mr Engler, a conservative Republican, upset James Blanchard, the two-term incumbent Democrat, by the thinnest of margins in November 1990. He entered office amid a worsening recession, in a once-rich state where economic downturns are almost always worse than elsewhere. The state's budget was the victim of the sinking economy, largesse that could no longer be sustained and questionable fiscal manoeuvres by his predecessor. Mr Engler won, among other reasons, because he vowed to balance the budget without levying new taxes or cuts in education spending, and ultimately to achieve a cut in onerous local property taxes.
Mr Engler is an affable man who has had just one career: politics. He was elected to the state legislature while still at university and rose to become the Senate majority leader, in which position he railed against Mr Blanchard's tendency for big-government solutions. Faced with a $1 billion deficit upon taking office, he put his money where his mouth was. His chief cuts have been in the state's social-welfare programmes, previously some of the nation's most generous. Welfare spending has been trimmed by $300m so far this year.
He insists that Michigan's welfare spending per head is still abnormally high. His critics say the state needs it: unemployment has been 50% above the national average for years. He eliminated General Assistance for 83,000 able-bodied adults with no dependents and was blamed when two homeless Detroit men, not long after losing their welfare payments, died of carbon monoxide poisoning--caused by a fire they started for heat in an abandoned house.
Democrats, who control the state House of Representatives, have growled their objections, sometimes viciously, but have approved most of the governor's requests. Part of their problem is a lack of a plausible alternative, other than a tax increase, something the public even more clearly does not want. Mr Engler may yet raise taxes on petrol and cigarettes this year--to pay for road repairs and health programmes--but his principal aim is to cut local property taxes, the primary source of the education budget.
Mr Engler's radical Republicanism goes deeper than budget cuts. He is planning to reorganise state government, in large part to ease regulatory burdens on business. A reorganisation of environmental policy has brought howls of protest from conservationists, including Republican ones. And some of his strongest supporters were appalled at his cuts in arts programmes. These have left the Detroit Institute of Arts--and one of the world's great museums--barely operating and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in continuing jeopardy.
If states are laboratories, the present crop of state budget deficits is providing controlled experiments in economic management. At one extreme, Jim Florio, a Democrat, has relied almost entirely on tax increases (of $2.8 billion) in New Jersey. At the other, Mr Engler in Michigan is relying almost entirely on spending cuts. In between, Pete Wilson of California and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut are trying equal amounts of both. Which suggests a simple rule for voters. If Michigan is thriving in five years' time and New Jersey stagnant, vote Republican. If vice versa, vote Democrat."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224164187/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/11?accountid=14657,"In 1988 a string of troubles bedevilled the Department of Energy's nuclear plants in the United States. Cracks appeared in the tritium-producing reactor at Savannah River, well-publicised leaks and contaminations occurred at Hanford in Washington, Mound in Ohio and Rocky Flats in Colorado. The problems were caused partly by the fact that the plants, many of them built hastily after the second world war, had been running flat out in the 1980s to keep up with the modernisation and expansion of America's nuclear forces. An expensive clean-up was ordered. A dire shortage of bomb-making fuel was predicted.
How things have changed. Now the DOE faces not a shortage of nuclear fuel, but overcapacity. Especially since George Bush decided last September unilaterally to dismantle part of the nuclear deterrent, the department has been thinking about how to close down much of the nuclear production line and reorganise the rest. Recycling the fuel from old weapons would keep the Pentagon supplied for many years.
The first casualty was a plan to build a new tritium-producing reactor, which was shelved in November. The DOE said it still needs a new reactor, but not before 2015. Meanwhile, tritium being perishable, it needed to reopen Savannah River instead.
After nearly three years and $2 billion worth of repairs, the ageing K reactor at Savannah River got the go-ahead to restart on December 13th. Nine days later, some radioactive heavy water leaked into the nearby river and moved downstream, contaminating the drinking water of 50,000 people in South Carolina and making at least two firms on the Georgia side of the river shut down temporarily.
The Savannah river flows into the Atlantic ocean just below Hilton Head and Beaufort, South Carolina--resorts renowned for their fragile marshes and estuaries and shown in a new Barbra Streisand film, ""The Prince of Tides"". South Carolina feared that the ebb and flow of contaminated tides in the low country could pose a threat to the state's wetlands, the ""nurseries"" for South Carolina's seafood industry. As the new year dawned, concentrations of radioactivity in the river had risen to twice the federal safety limit, although the DOE later concluded there had been no threat to public health.
The tritium leak has reawakened fears about the safety of the 37-year-old reactor, which had numerous fissures and countless other defects before it was closed down for repairs in 1988. Unlike every American commercial reactor, the K reactor is not fully encased in a containment building to protect workers and nearby residents if there is a meltdown.
Safety aside, environmentalists question the need for more tritium in the post-Soviet era. Even allowing for its perishability, enough tritium is stockpiled at the Savannah River site to build 19,000 nuclear warheads, says Frances Close Hart of the Energy Research Foundation, a watchdog group that opposed the restarting of the K reactor. Fifty years from now, even if no additional tritium were ever produced, the United States would still have enough tritium for about 1,000 hydrogen bombs, Ms Hart estimates.
But neither she nor other opponents of the K reactor hold out much hope that the latest problems will close the plant for good. Most state and local officials are in favour of restarting it because it would create jobs. They are inclined to accept reassuring words from Washington.
The DOE says the leak had gone undetected for a day because the person charged with delivering a water sample for testing was ill and no replacement had been nominated. The department will now drastically increase monitoring. At present, water samples are tested for contamination every 12 hours; new equipment currently being installed at the plant will allow testing every half-hour, and a back-up system will run further tests every two hours.
Of other nuclear-weapons plants around the country, the one at Rocky Flats, just north of Denver, is also under local pressure to close. At Rocky Flats, plutonium fission bombs are made to act as triggers in hydrogen fusion bombs. For 20 years the plant has been the subject of bitter wrangles between Colorado's influential environmental groups and the workers at the plant. The workers have been loud in defence both of their jobs and of their conviction that they are a vital part of America's security.
Two years ago, after a raid by federal agents, it was alleged that hazardous waste had been dumped illegally, though no case has yet been brought to trial. Local critics have long maintained that water supplies have been contaminated by the plant. Production of the plutonium triggers stopped after the raid, but the plant still has more than 7,000 workers; the critics maintain that, mystifyingly, employment has increased by a third in the past few years.
Lately there has been talk that a plutonium analytical laboratory on the site may soon be reopened, though it seems unlikely that manufacture of the triggers will ever resume. Ginger Swartz, the executive director of the Rocky Flats Environmental Monitoring Council, maintains that the only work left on the site is ""D and D"", decommissioning and decontamination. There are 168 buildings on the site that need to be cleaned up. By court order, the decontamination work must be completed by 2019. Yet, to the frustration of Colorado's politicians, the DOE has still not categorically said that Rocky Flats' days are numbered.
NUCLEAR GRIDLOCK
Two decades of worrying about how to dispose of nuclear waste has now resulted in a gigantic nuclear traffic jam. A Colorado nuclear power plant cannot close down its unsuccessful experimental reactor because Idaho's governor, Cecil Andrus, will not allow the shipment of its core to a facility in Idaho until that facility's own waste is sent to a disposal site in New Mexico. Mr Andrus has similarly barred shipments into Idaho of waste from the nuclear-weapons plant at Rocky Flats, in Colorado. But the New Mexico site, called the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP), cannot begin operating until the the Department of Energy (DOE) satisfies both state and congressional critics that it can operate the disposal site safely. And that issue is bound up in a series of lawsuits and congressional bills.
The problem is ostensibly trivial: the land on which WIPP stands belongs to the Interior Department, not the DOE. The Bush administration tried to move it from one to the other; this angered local congressmen who argued that Congress would need to approve such a swap. A federal court recently agreed, in a case brought by New Mexico's attorney-general, Tom Udall.
Mr Udall opposes the opening of WIPP without safety standards set by an independent agency. When Congress reconvenes later this month, it will consider legislation that will require the DOE to follow safety standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, and specify the amount of compensation the DOE must pay the state for its costs in building road by-passes to make the transport of the nuclear waste safer. All this could put off the opening of WIPP for another year or more.
Further delays, however, will only exacerbate another problem--WIPP's collapsing salt caverns. The underground depository, located near Carlsbad, was designed to allow its rooms dug out of salt domes to collapse slowly around the 850,000 55-gallon (208-litre) drums of military waste and toxic materials to be stored there. But some of the ceilings are now falling in on nothing, requiring wooden supports until the waste arrives. The DOE says it can still seal off the rooms, but critics charge that falling chunks of ceiling, some as heavy as 100 tons, will make the DOE'S test phase dangerous and might damage stored drums in future.
New Mexico also wants its money. In 1984 the DOE contracted to pay the state $200m to defray its costs in building the bypasses. In a court agreement, the department also agreed to pay New Mexico up to $100m more to improve the roads the waste would be carried on. But the DOE has now backed away from these commitments.
The department's welshing also caused concern in Nevada, whose officials are bitterly opposed to the plan to store nuclear waste from civil plants at Yucca Mountain near Las Vegas. Environmental critics question the wisdom of choosing only one site to study, which is what Congress authorised in 1982 when it passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, otherwise known as the ""screw Nevada bill"". Now the DOE is trying to move past a difficult controversy over the Nevada site that was raised by one of its own geologists, Jerry Szymanski. Mr Szymanski contends that earthquakes around Yucca Mountain could cause water to rise and flood the repository, spreading radioactive pollution as far as California's Death Valley.
A five-member panel of experts appointed by both Mr Szymanski and the DOE concluded in a 3-2 split vote that Mr Szymanski is wrong. Now the National Academy of Science is studying the issue. The secretary of energy has delayed the deadline for opening the national respository from 1998 to 2010.
The delay is making the operators of nuclear power plants nervous. There are 111 plants operating at 70 sites around the country, mostly in the east. Those running out of storage room for their spent fuel can either rebuild their storage pools to insert more fuel elements, build dry-cask storage units or ship their waste to other sites. But many have contracts with the DOE to provide permanent storage by 1998, and resent the extra cost to their ratepayers if they have to build more temporary storage facilities.
The DOE'S dilemma has prompted it to send an emissary around the country to sell the benefits of housing nuclear waste to other states and to Indian tribes, whose sparsely settled reservations and poverty make them potentially eager buyers. So far only two have responded, North Dakota's Grant County and the Mescalero Indian Tribe in southern Arizona. These sites could offer the utilities temporary storage from which the waste could be retrieved. But the DOE scheme would still not fulfill its contracts to provide a permanent disposal facility by 1998.
NUCLEAR EXPORTS TO MARS?
The Department of Energy's reactors make fuel for nuclear warheads; the navy's reactors drive submarines. The air force, not to be left out, now wants to build reactors for rockets. On January 13th it confirmed what leaks to the Federation of American Scientists had revealed last year: that it is working once more on a nuclear-powered rocket, at Jackass Flats in Nevada, close to where its first attempt to build a nuclear rocket fizzled out in 1972. The programme, begun by the Strategic Defence Initiative Organisation (SDIO) four years ago and recently handed over to the air force, used to be called Timberwind. Now it goes by the more grandiose Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Programme.
Some nuclear physicists in the 1930s, versed in the works of Wells and Verne, saw space flight, not bombs, as the goal of their endeavours. But the appeal of a rocket, which would simply heat up liquid in a nuclear reactor and squirt it out as gas, has never outweighed the problems of developing one, given that conventional rockets can do the job pretty well just by burning chemicals.
There are some things, though, for which a nuclear rocket is uniquely well suited. A trip to Mars would be easier with a nuclear rocket, because it would have to carry less fuel. The air force would like its rocket to be seen as part of such a bold endeavour. But its budget--$130m spent so far, $50m more this year and perhaps $800m in total--dwarfs NASA'S exploration budget, which suggests that the air force has other things in mind. Its rocket is not, in any case, of the kind best suited to exploration.
It is not clear what it is suited to, except exciting that small but influential group of people who like all things nuclear. If the system were good for launching satellites--it may well not be--it would be all but impossible to get it a clean bill of environmental health. Perhaps it has a use that involves making frequent trips from one orbit to another.
Meanwhile, interest in Russian space power rumbles on. According to the Federation of American Scientists, SDIO has considered using a nuclear reactor used on Soviet satellites--not a rocket engine but an electric generator. There were some Russians making encouraging noises at the meeting in Albuquerque at which the air force talked about Timberwind. Their model rocket, though, does not even have a desert to stand on. It is sitting on the Los Angeles dockside, refused admittance by suspicious customs officers."

Super Bowl XXVI (the Roman numerals evoke gladiators) is designed to draw, as usual, waves of company bosses--the kind of people who equate winning at football with wiping out competitors--to spend great sums while watching the vast meat of the Buffalo Bills encounter the mountainous flesh of the Washington Redskins.
Chances are, they will also see a Bill or a Redskin carried supine hors de combat. American football, a sport that rewards brute force and high pain tolerance with victory, exacts an appalling physical toll. Every one of the National Football League's 1,200-odd players is likely to be injured during a four-month season; many are hurt more than once. In the 1989 Super Bowl between teams from San Francisco and Cincinnati, viewers watched, in slow-motion, the tibia of Cincinnati's ""nose-tackle"", Tim Krumrie, snap in two. Mr Krumrie, at least, was able to play again. Last month Mike Utley, a member of the Detroit Lions, fell on his head. The impact crushed several vertebrae and paralysed him from the neck down.
Such severe injuries are the exception, and football is not alone in occasionally crippling its participants. But no sport matches it for the frequency of shredded ligaments, broken fingers, popped shoulders and the like. Injuries are so common that every professional football stadium, and many university-level ones, have an x-ray room for examination of shattered limbs.
Nor do most players last much longer than gladiators. Players survive in the NFL, on average, less than four years before injuries or younger usurpers see them off. Steve Courson, a mammoth 295lb (134kg) ""tackle"" for the Pittsburgh Steelers, has grimly recounted this life in his new book ""False Glory"", which describes players compelled to hide serious injuries and load themselves with steroids and other drugs to sustain their careers. Don Strock, a former quarterback for the Miami Dolphins, recounts in his own recent memoirs how players would gather around an injured team-mate during a game to screen from spectators the use of painkilling injections, then hide the needles under the carpet-like synthetic ""turf"".
For Mr Courson, the decision to do whatever was required to remain competitive may have shaved decades off his life. He is 36 years old, and the muscles of his heart have deteriorated to the point where he will need a transplant if he is to live past 40. He graciously defers to statistics that say the connection between his past steroid use and current illness is unclear. Another former football player, Lyle Alzado, is less circumspect. He bluntly blames his steroids for his brain cancer. Meanwhile, the best-known player from the 1960s, Joe Namath, is barely able to walk on knees crippled by repeated surgery.
Steroids (officially banned but probably still common) have made players larger and therefore able to injure one another more easily. Indeed, the number of NFL players weighing more than 300lb increased from 23 to 370 between 1981 and 1991, according to Harper's magazine. The evolution to hugeness is duplicated at the college level. The Rose Bowl on January 1st featured 18 players weighing more than 280lb. Each wore 25lb of protective gear.
Statistics, however, show that at the university level the large players of the best teams are less likely to be hurt than the smaller players who play for smaller universities. Nor have injuries at the professional level risen in proportion to the size increase. It seems that big, strong players can do more damage--and withstand more."

For 23 years, the Children's Television Workshop of New York has been making television programmes that really do both entertain and inform: the children who first learnt their numbers and letters from ""Sesame Street"" must now be counted in the millions.
But that is not all ""Sesame Street"" does. Quite deliberately, it introduces children to the diversity of life. Recently, for example, the non-puppet characters on the show have included a blind man and a mute woman. Songs introduce some basic Spanish (like ""amigo means friend""). Last year the programmes had as a theme black American culture; this year they are looking at American Indians, next year at Latinos. A spokeswoman for the Workshop says that Sesame Street tries to help children understand the similarities and differences between cultures.
In a society like America's, which has always been ethnically and culturally diverse, only an idiot (or a bigot) could take exception to that. When a student at Duke University in North Carolina told the Washington Post last year ""We grew up on Sesame Street; you know, 'habla espanol' and racial harmony on the playground"", she was paying the programme a compliment that it thoroughly deserves.
THE INTOLERANCE OF THE TOO-TOLERANT
The problem comes when the sensible tolerance and respect of ""Sesame Street"" are mutated into something less appealing. First, it becomes a kind of hyper-tolerance (which argues, for example, that the canon of black female authors is as rich as that of white male authors); which is merely silly. Second, it becomes an intolerance of those who do not practise this hyper-tolerance (so that anyone who argues that a canon of authors who happen to be white and male is better than one picked by sex and skin colour is a racist sexist); which is pernicious. It is the intolerance that has come to be called ""political correctness""--or PC.
Nearly two years after PC was noticed by the mass media, there is still no agreement on how important a phenomenon it is. On one side stand those, like Robert Bork, a conservative jurist whose 1987 nomination to the Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate, who think PC is a sign that American culture is in possibly terminal decline. In a speech last year Mr Bork, a kind of beefy St Sebastian, considered by his fans the first martyr to the arrows of the politically correct, lumped PC with ""leftist politicisation and increased vulgarity.""
On the other side are old-fashioned liberals who think that the whole discovery of PC is a plot. According to this theory, conservatives like Dinesh D'Souza, once an adviser in the Reagan White House, noticed that the humanities faculties of universities had been untouched by the conservative triumphs of the 1980s and attacked. Mr D'Souza's book ""Illiberal Education"" was a catalogue of trimmings and perversions of curriculums in the name of PC. This, mutter liberals darkly, is all an attempt to terrrorise them through ridicule into adopting the values of conservatism.
In a reply to Mr Bork, Ben Wattenberg, a conservative scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, has taken a different tack. Mr Wattenberg credits liberals for getting on to the national agenda issues, like racism and feminism, ""that are at the essence of individualism, upward mobility, pluralism, opportunity"". He confidently states that ""our universities are the best in the world...there are about 400,000 foreign students here"", and points out that most of them are studying subjects like science and engineering where the ravages of PC are unknown (or, at least, rare).
The statistics are ambiguous. Throughout the 1980s, when the PC thought-police were supposedly doing their worst, young Americans were more likely to be conservative than their elders. Indeed, Ronald Reagan's appeal to young voters was a vital part of his success. According to Gallup, at the the end of his time in office more of those under 30 approved of him (71%) than of those aged from 30 to 49 (63%) or over 50 (56%).
Since then young people have apparently been swinging left again. This swing cannot be blamed on some dark PC plot to addle impressionable minds: some new data from the annual American Freshmen Survey suggest that the number of first-year students--ie, before indoctrination--who describe themselves as liberal or far left is increasing, and the number calling themselves conservative or far right declining. But although PC may not have spread left-wing views, it could still have infected political discourse with taboos and sensitivities.
Yet one of the curiosities of PC is that, for all the acres of newsprint that has been devoted to it, it has not really surfaced as a political issue itself. George Bush has made only one big (and not terribly good) speech on the matter. Patrick Buchanan, his challenger for the Republican presidential nomination, is bashing both PC and multiculturalism in his insurgent campaign, but there is no sign yet that it is this part of his message that is garnering support.
Not that this proves PC trivial. Most issues that matter are omitted from election campaigns. The problem remains how to throw out the bathwater of despotic intolerance without losing the baby of multicultural tolerance. It is not only harassed parents who need ""Sesame Street""."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139826/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/15?accountid=14657,"Assuming that China's prime minister, Li Peng, arrives in New York as planned later this month for the special meeting of the ""big five"" members of the United Nations Security Council, China's international rehabilitation will be virtually complete. The impending establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel is expected to produce a much-prized invitation to take part in the next multilateral stage of the Middle East peace process. From global arms talks to Asian trade talks, China now has its feet under all the top tables. Yet its ageing Communist warlords, and their proteges like Mr Li, are troubled.
Not that they like to show it. They point proudly to the string of high-level visitors to Beijing in recent months, from Japan's prime minister of the moment, Toshiki Kaifu, to Britain's John Major, from Vietnam's party boss to America's secretary of state. China's president, Yang Shangkun, recently visited Singapore and Malaysia, the latest stops in a diplomatic effort to improve relations with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN, which also includes Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Brunei). Before that, Mr Yang had trailed goodwill and, probably, promises of more arms sales, through Pakistan and Iran. Last month Mr Li became the first Chinese prime minister to visit India since the two countries fought a border war in 1962.
For all their bustle, China's leaders are at odds with the world. The two recent events that have jarred most have been the Gulf war, which demonstrated America's readiness to enforce the rules of Mr Bush's ""new world order"", and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Rebuked by the United States after the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989, China had found a certain solace (thumbing its nose at Mr Bush) in restored relations with its Soviet neighbour. But since last August's putsch in Moscow, communism is extinct in Europe and threatened everywhere.
Ideologically virtually friendless (not even China has the all to try to create a new Communist International with Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba, virtually all that is left of the world communist movement), China has also been stripped of two things it particularly cherished: its self-appointed role as spokesman for the third world, and the cover that enabled it to court with impunity the world's bandit-states.
The old ""third world"" is split between the successful developers and the rest. As the standard-bearer of the failed socialist path of development, China has little credibility. The end of the cold war, the reduction in America's presence overseas and the Soviet collapse have all lent new weight to regional powers. In Asia that encourages Japan, India, even South Korea to match their political weight against China's.
The new focus on regional problems also puts China's arms sales under the spotlight. Its sales of medium-range nuclear-capable missiles to Saudi Arabia, and shorter-range missiles to Pakistan, Syria and Iran look particularly reckless alongside past readiness to sell equipment that could be used to make nuclear weapons to Pakistan, India, Iraq, Iran, Algeria and others. Since China is no longer needed to counter Soviet influence in these countries, America's irritation at China's habits has grown.
China has now said it will sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), observe the guidelines of the western-sponsored Missile-Technology Control Regime and be ""prudent"" in its transfers of sophisticated conventional weapons. That would not have stopped a big deal done a year ago to sell about $1 billion-worth of weapons--from fighter aircraft to small arms--to repressive Myanmar (Burma) and which went down badly with ASEAN.
But China's biggest diplomatic worry is North Korea. Like South Korea and Japan, China has little interest in seeing Kim Il Sung's crabby regime get its hands on the bomb. But neither can China bring itself publicly to condemn North Korea's blatant flouting of its NPT obligations. The foreign minister, Qian Qichen, has given clear warning that China will veto attempts to use force against the North.
There are bigger issues at stake than solicitude for the hermit-like Mr Kim. With communism in disarray and America the only real superpower, China's internal propaganda machine is issuing shrill warnings of the threat of ""peaceful evolution"", code for the contamination of China's socialism with the spores of American-led democracy. If the Americans were allowed to have their way over North Korea, so the thinking goes, then none of Asia's remaining communists would be safe. In reality, the greatest threats to China's political stability come from closer to home: economic tensions between rich (and outward-looking) and poor (and captive) regions within the country, and the upheavals on its northern and western borders.
China has moved fast to establish relations with all the newly created Central Asian states, but especially Tajikitan, Kirgizia and Kazakhstan, with which it shares a common border. From Tibet in the west, through Xinjiang to Chinese Inner Mongolia, vast, sparsely populated but strategically important areas of China are inhabited by national minorities prone to unrest. With newly free compatriots across the border, the hoped-for increase in border trade is bound to bring with it unwanted religious and political influences. Whichever way China turns, there is trouble in store."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139975/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/16?accountid=14657,"It was like a rerun of the Recruit bribery scandal. Burly young Japanese policemen raced into a Tokyo hospital on January 13th and hauled out a politician who had fled there in the hope of appearing too ill to be arrested. The doctors shrugged their shoulders and Fumio Abe--a former cabinet minister and an official in the party faction headed by the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa--was taken away to jail.
Mr Abe is accused of receiving Y80m ($630,000) from a steel-frame company called Kyowa in return for helping the firm with its projects in Hokkaido. He was the minister in charge of Hokkaido development at the time. The Tokyo public prosecutor appears to be giving Mr Abe an even harder time than when he was gunning for the politicians and civil servants involved in the Recruit shares-for-favours investigation in 1988-89. Several were accused of corruption but none was arrested. Mr Abe is in fact the first member of the Diet (parliament) to be arrested since 1976, when Kakuei Tanaka and several others were in trouble over the Lockheed bribery case.
The public prosecutor's office is sending a message to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party that it does not think much of the party's half-hearted attempt--now largely abandoned--to clean up Japanese politics. The previous prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, tried without success to reform the Japanese electoral system, along with its insatiable appetite for campaign funds. His attempts helped make him the most popular prime minister with the public since the war. But Mr Kaifu was booted out of office by the party bigwigs. His replacement, Mr Miyazawa, promptly abandoned electoral reform. He is an old-style leader, comfortably free of reformist zeal.
The Kyowa affair is said to be the dirtiest of Japan's 15 major bribery cases since the war that have involved Diet members. Mr Abe is said by the public prosecutor to have given the firm details of the route planned for a main road in Hokkaido so that it could buy up the land beforehand. He also, it is alleged, helped to get Kyowa cheap government loans. The prosecutor's office is particularly angry that all this supposedly went on when the Recruit case was in the headlines. If the ruling party could not restrain its members then, will it ever manage to get a grip on corruption?
Mr Abe resigned his post in the Miyazawa faction last month when the investigators were closing in. He has since resigned from the ruling party, though not from the Diet. Mr Miyazawa will find it difficult to distance himself from the former minister. Mr Abe is said to have been given Y50m to pass on to his political boss. The Miyazawa faction admitted this week that it accepted a Y10m ""membership fee"" from a fund-raising group run by Mr Abe in 1989. According to a story told to the public prosecutor, the money was obtained from Kyowa and was used to buy Mr Abe a place in the Kaifu cabinet.
All told, Mr Abe is said to have pocketed Y480m ($3.8m) of Kyowa's money. Four other members of the Miyazawa faction, among them Zenko Suzuki, a former prime minister, are alleged to have received money from Kyowa. Its total pay-out to politicians is said to have topped Y2.2 billion.
The opposition parties have promised to give the government a grilling in the new parliamentary session due to start on January 24th. The Buddhist-affiliated Komeito (""clean government party"") is saying that Mr Miyazawa should take ""political and moral responsibility"" for the Kyowa affair--Diet-speak for doing the honourable thing and falling on his sword.
Even without the scandal, the prime minister is facing a tough session. The opposition parties want defence spending to be further cut in the budget for the next financial year. The government proposes to increase the defence bill by only 3.5% instead of the usual 6%, and is unwilling to see a bigger cut. If the budget is not passed before the end of March, it will have to draw up a stop-gap budget, adding to Mr Miyazawa's reputation for political bungling.
As much as the Liberal Democrats' leaders now rue the day they let Mr Miyazawa become prime minister, they know they are stuck with him--at least until the end of July. That is when half the upper-house seats are up for re-election. With the popular Mr Kaifu at the helm, the party felt it at least had a chance of narrowing the gap with the opposition in the upper house, if not actually winning back the majority it lost in the wake of the Recruit scandal. With Mr Miyazawa in charge, the party leaders fear that they could lose even more seats in the upper house. Getting controversial legislation through the Diet would then be impossible.
That is why Shin Kanemaru, the Liberal Democrats' ageing godfather and boss of the party's biggest faction, agreed last week to accept the honorary title of vice-president of the party. Mr Miyazawa has been badgering him to do so since taking office, as it would confer endorsement of his shaky administration by the party's most powerful cabal. For better or worse, Mr Kanemaru has decided that the party must close ranks if it is to fend off criticism about Mr Abe and the Kyowa scandal. What Mr Kanemaru also knows is that the Kyowa affair promises to be small beer alongside yet another political scandal now brewing. Watch for the next thrilling installment."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224174729/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/17?accountid=14657,"An Islamic bomb, ticking quietly for the past 11 years, has finally exploded. Pakistan's Federal Shariat Court, the highest Islamic law-making body, pronounced last month that riba (interest or usury) is un-Islamic and therefore illegal. By extension, so is the country's entire financial system--which is why the government of Nawaz Sharif, anxious not to scare away both foreign and domestic investors, is trying to gain time to find some sort of solution.
The Islamic court wants the government to amend all financial laws in accordance with its decision by June 30th. Otherwise, it says, ""the various provisions of the laws discussed in the judgment and held repugnant to the injunctions of Islam will cease to have effect."" This so far involves some 20 laws which include the offending concept of riba. They cover such matters as negotiable instruments, land acquisition, codes of civil procedure, co-operative societies, insurance, money lending and compensation.
None of this should have taken the government by surprise. After General Zia ul Haq seized power in 1977, he donned the cloak of Islam to establish his legitimacy. In 1979 he enacted six Islamic laws. One prescribed death by stoning as the penalty for adultery. He also amended the constitution to establish Islamic benches in the superior courts, empowering them to review and strike down any laws ""repugnant to Islam"". The shariat court was set up in 1980 to examine which laws could be Islamicised, and how. Its decisions were to be communicated to parliament by the government, and any changes in the law were to be made within a period set by the court.
Zia was careful, however, to restrain his zealotry. Laws relating to fiscal, procedural or family matters were to be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Islamic benches until 1982--and Zia subsequently amended the constitution to extend this exclusion, first to 1985 and then to 1990. Moreover, Zia, as president, kept all the reins of power in his own hands: the court's judges were appointed or dismissed under presidential discretion; the government could also appeal against a decision before the Islamic Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court.
Since 1982, when the court acquired the power to examine any law for Islamic deviance, in addition to reviewing petitions, it has scrutinised 1,511 laws and declared 267 to be wholly or partly un-Islamic. But neither the court nor the federal law department will say how many of these have been amended, and some laws that have been amended have yet to be enforced.
In June 1990 Zia's period of exclusion expired and the court acquired the right to examine fiscal matters. Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister of the day, was too preoccupied with political survival to take any notice. Nor did she have the numbers in parliament to amend the constitution. Her successor, Mr Sharif, seems also to have ignored the threat. The court complains that ""the government, though represented by senior counsel, rendered no assistance to the court""). Last September, when Mr Sharif did try to enforce the court's recommendations on compensation and other money matters, a strike by transport drivers forced the government to give up the attempt.
Will the same be true when the government tries to apply Islamic law to the financial industry? The government says that even before the court's decision, it had appointed a commission to eliminate riba from the economy. Perhaps the commission is the beginning of a fudge. The finance minister, Sartaj Aziz, notes, ""Although riba is totally prohibited in Islam, unfortunately there is no universally acceptable definition of riba in the Muslim world according to which existing financial practices can be tested on the basis of Islamic law.""
Spoken like a politician--but Mr Sharif's government is a coalition. It could have tried to win a two-thirds vote in parliament to extend the exclusion of financial matters from the shariat court's scrutiny, or it could have appealed against last month's decision to the Supreme Court. Either way it would have offended Jamaat-i-Islami and other religious parties in Mr Sharif's Islamic Democratic Alliance. Instead, it has got one of the country's privatised banks, the Muslim Commerce Bank, to appeal to the Supreme Court to extend beyond June 30th the period allowed by the shariat court before its judgment comes into effect.
If the appeal is successful, the government will win some breathing space, although it is unclear how Mr Sharif can use it to protect Pakistan's economic future."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224158324/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/18?accountid=14657,"Over the years, as the civil war in Sri Lanka grew fiercer, many Sri Lankan Tamils fled to southern India, which has a large Tamil population. Now some of the 200,000 refugees there are going home. This is not a sign that the war is coming to an end. It is, though, an indication that India and Sri Lanka are trying to end their differences.
These have been linked to the secessionist campaign being waged by Tamil Tiger rebels in north-eastern Sri Lanka. For years India tacitly supported the Tigers. The government in Tamil Nadu tolerated Tiger training camps in the state. Those days are over. Any residual sympathy for the rebels disappeared last year with the murder of Rajiv Gandhi, for which the Tigers are blamed.
But what sort of future awaits the homecomers? The first of them are due to arrive by ship in the Sri Lankan port of Trincomalee on January 22nd. The Indian authorities say more than 30,000 people have agreed to return to the island voluntarily. Refugee workers in Tamil Nadu say the number who want to go home is much smaller, and that many people have signed forms written in English, which they cannot understand.
The safety of the refugees is far from assured. The government has retaken control of much of the east of the country, and says it can protect those who return. It points out, reasonably, that all Sri Lankan citizens have a right to come back; some will be able to return to their homes, others will have to stay in camps. However, although the Tigers are in retreat, they remain a threat even in government-held areas. If they carry out a successful ambush or landmine attack near a refugee camp, as they often strive to do, experience suggests that it will be the refugees who suffer reprisals.
Most refugees intend to stay in southern India until the civil war is over. Those who want to come back now are government servants who have jobs that they will lose if they do not return, or people who have grown weary of waiting for the fighting to end. The current prospects for peace do not look promising. The Sri Lankan armed forces appear to be planning a major assault on the Jaffna peninsula, the heartland of support for the Tigers. The government has the military strength to drive the Tigers from Jaffna, but the guerrillas would probably continue their war from the jungle.
A Tamil member of the Sri Lankan cabinet has proposed giving substantial autonomy to the north and east as an acceptable price for peace. The plan has come under attack from nationalist groups among the majority Sinhalese, and from influential sections of the Buddhist clergy. They believe any concessions along ethnic lines would lead to the breakup of the country. Other Sri Lankans say that such an attitude aggravates communal tensions and wins support for the Tigers. If the Tigers regain their strength and the fighting intensifies, many Tamil refugees are likely to seek sanctuary in India again."

Today opium is still a menace, especially in its refined form, heroin. Thailand is notorious as a transit centre for heroin made from opium grown in the golden triangle--the mountainous area where Thailand, Myanmar (Burma) and Laos meet. The government is seemingly powerless to stop the flow of China white to the junkies of New York. But it can claim one notable success. It is ending opium growing on its own soil.
General Chavalit Yodmani, the head of the Control Board of the Office of Narcotics for the past nine years, behaves more like a gentleman farmer than a gun-wielding drug-buster. ""Law enforcement is a sign of failure,"" says the softly spoken general. ""Besides, it's very expensive.""
Rather than ordering the hill tribes to stop growing opium, he offers them a better way of life by teaching them to grow other crops. The government builds schools, bring in electricity and gives the hill people Thai citizenship. Aid agencies help out too. But if the villagers persist in planting poppies the crop is destroyed.
Ban Mae Ya is a village of Lisu people about three hours' drive from Chiang Mai. Until a dirt track was built to the village six years ago, its only visitors were drug traffickers, who offered rice in exchange for the villagers' opium paste. Now the village makes more money from coffee, passion fruit and barley, for the barley is supplied by a brewery that guarantees a price for the crop. A small school has been built and a teacher brought in from Chiang Mai. Ban Khun Sa Nai, a Hmong village to the south, used to grow 50 hectares (125 acres) of opium a year. This year it has only one small field of opium which will be used to keep the village's seven aged addicts content. The rest of its fields are producing legal crops.
In 1985 opium was grown on some 8,900 hectares in Thailand. This year less than half that area has been sown with the poppy: about 3,700 hectares is thought to be producing opium. But the general says that the crop on 3,000 hectares will be cut down before it is ready for harvesting. In the past he has taken an even more direct approach to getting rid of refineries that turn opium into heroin: ""We bombed them.""
Foreign anti-drug agencies praise the general's efforts as far as they go, which is to Thailand's borders and no farther. America's Drug Enforcement Agency believes that opium production worldwide has doubled over the past five years and that much of the increase comes from the golden triangle, particularly Myanmar, where traffickers appear to operate freely. The agency guesses that Myanmar will produce 2,000-2,500 tonnes of opium this year. Myanmar's drugs bosses are looking for new export routes: the volume of heroin passing through China has increased sharply. However, Thailand's booming economy and good transport network mean it remains an ideal distribution base: ""We cannot stop it from coming across the border,"" says General Chavalit. He has a point. Much of the land border with Myanmar is remote and unguarded.
A more telling criticism of Thailand is that heroin appears to move through the country with little difficulty. General Chavalit says that Chang Chi-fu, a drug boss better known as Khun Sa, may ship as much as 60 tonnes of heroin through Thailand each year. Between 1981 and 1990, only 10.2 tonnes was seized in the whole country. During 1991, police in Chiang Mai province, one of the trade's nerve centres, found a miserable 58 kilos (128lb) of heroin.
The police say the traffickers are devilishly cunning. They impregnate heroin into shirts like starch; mix it with paint; sew it inside goldfish; and persuade people (mostly Nigerians) to swallow condoms full of it. But these techniques tend to be used by small-time gangs. The big gangs ship in bulk: more than 1 tonne of heroin, thought to belong to Khun Sa, was seized in the port of Bangkok in 1988. In May last year a shipment of 480 kilos of heroin, worth over $1.5 billion, was seized in Los Angeles.
Moving such quantities around suggests some official connivance. Veth Petborom, a major-general in the Thai police, was retired on a full pension after he was accused in America of drug trafficking in 1990. Last August an official at Thailand's embassy in London was arrested at Heathrow airport with 60 kilos of heroin.
A kilo of Khun Sa's Uoglobe No 4 heroin, said to be the purest kind obtainable, and recognisable by its logo of two lions resting their forepaws on a globe, costs around $5,750 in Chiang Mai. The price doubles at each stage of its journey until it costs more than $150,000 wholesale in America. Corruption will continue as long as the trade remains so profitable."

Now we have entered the tunnel,"" said Saeb Erakat, one of the Palestinians at the Middle East peace talks in Washington this week. There is little light at the end of it. Three rounds into their dialogue, the Arabs and Israelis moved from talks about talks to something a little closer to real negotiation. But progress depends on the political weather in the Middle East and there, particularly in Israel, the forecast is bad.
Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud government appear to have lost their parliamentary majority in mid-negotiation. The talks were anyway limping along. The main achievement this week was an agreement that allowed Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian delegates to move from a couch in a hallway on the State Department's sixth floor, where they spent six days last month, to a room with a table and chairs. The formula, completed in a flurry of faxes, laid down that Israel would discuss Palestinian issues with a team of nine Palestinians and two Jordanians; then, at a separate time, would discuss Israeli-Jordanian relations with nine Jordanians and two Palestinians. This allowed the Israelis to say they were dealing with a joint delegation, the Palestinians to say that Israel had at last recognised them as a distinct party to the talks.
Of the four negotiations under way (Israel is also talking to Syria and Lebanon), the Israeli-Jordanian talks were the most cordial. The two countries, which have observed a de facto peace since the 1967 war, agreed that their aim was a peace treaty and full diplomatic relations. The Jordanians are anxious to establish their independence from Palestinian issues, and to show that they have matters of their own to negotiate with Israel. But they have to be careful. Israel is believed to be ready to make a fairly generous offer on the two slivers of non-West Bank Jordanian territory that it occupies. Jordan can hardly accept this while the Israelis hold the West Bank.
The most fruitless encounter was between Israel and Syria. ""We say legitimacy, they say withdrawal,"" lamented an Israeli. The Israelis insist that nothing can happen until Syria recognises Israel's right to exist; the Syrians insist that Israel must first agree to withdraw from the Golan Heights.
The Israelis and Palestinians exchanged conflicting lists of things to discuss. At least they could joke. The Israelis talked about an ""interim self-government authority""--ISGA; the Arabs, adding Palestinian to the acronym, made it PISGA, which in the Bible was the summit from which Moses looked out over the Promised Land. Israel's ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval, insisted that PISGA stood for ""permanent Israel sovereign government authority"".
The Israelis, with their eyes on the political crisis at home, were careful to offer nothing in writing. Instead, they read out areas of authority that might apply to the ISGA, including agriculture, taxation, trade, education and local police. They excluded security, foreign affairs and anything to do with the 100,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians, for their part, provided a two-page outline of provisions already rejected by Israel. These included participation in self-rule by Arab residents of Jerusalem, and the election of a parliament that would assume authority over all the people, land and resources in the territories until their final status was decided.
The talks were quickly mired in accusations about who was responsible for the continuing violence in the territories. A Palestinian attack on January 14th on a bus carrying West Bank settlers, which injured Seven Israelis, provoked Israeli charges of Palestinian hypocrisy. The Palestinians, meanwhile, wanted the whole issue of Jewish settlement, and the need for a freeze on it, to be high on the agenda.
The Israelis had no intention of talking about that; Mr Shoval, for good measure, said it should not be even discussed until three years into self-government. To preserve the shaky ruling coalition, the Israeli delegates wanted to talk about as little as possible. Even the oral mention of self-rule as a future topic has probably destroyed the prime minister's majority in parliament. The leaders of two tiny far-right parties, Tehiya and Moledet, had been threatening to leave the cabinet should there be any question of offering the Palestinians autonomy. When the Washington talks touched on this issue, the two parties vowed to leave the cabinet on January 19th. The departure of the right-wingers would leave Mr Shamir with 59 seats in the 120-member Knesset, and no safe majority. It seemed likely that he would resign, but stay on for 100 days, as the constitution prescribes, until an election.
Mr Shamir would probably have liked to drag his government, and the peace talks, on for a month or so while the Americans reconsider Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees to help with immigrant resettlement. Congress, which will rule on the matter in February, is expected to impose conditions about not spending the money on new Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Although Mr Shamir knew he was unlikely to get all that he had asked for, he wanted to avoid making matters worse by looking like a spoiler in the peace talks.
Yet bringing the election forward by six months or so (it was due by November anyhow) would have the advantage for Mr Shamir of interrupting the peace talks, which he dislikes, just when the Americans hoped their financial pressure was brining him into real negotiations. The Israelis, having consistently demanded that the talks should take place closer to, if not in, the Middle East, have said there should be no more talks in Washington.
Plans are going ahead for wider talks in Moscow on January 28th and 29th. About 20 countries, including China, Turkey, Japan and several European nations, are expected to join Israel and most Arab governments in a pretty pointless jamboree discussing more general Middle East issues such as refugees, water and arms control."

This strange lull, after what was in effect an army takeover, could be broken on Friday when Islamic fundamentalists, robbed of their victory in the parliamentary election, are likely to express their frustration in their sermons. The leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS, anxious to avoid a bloody bust-up with the soldiers, have given warning that not everything heard at Friday prayers is official FIS policy.
President Chadli Benjedid's forced departure on January 11th was muted. A brief mumbled appearance on Algerian television put an end to his 13 years in office. The military takeover was shrouded in constitutional niceties. The generals, exchanging their uniforms for civilian suits, spoke of the need to safeguard national security and public order; their first step was to cancel the second round of voting planned for January 16th at which the FIS, having won 188 seats in the first round, needed only 28 more for a majority in the 430-seat National Assembly.
The prime minister, Sid Ahmed Ghozali, appeared on television in his capacity as the head of the High Security Council--the army's first attempt at camouflage--to assure people he was in charge. Strictly speaking, the head of the National Assembly should have taken over after Mr Chadli's resignation, but parliament had been discreetly dissolved at the beginning of the month. With Khaled Nezzar, the minister of defence, Larbi Belkheir, the minister of the interior, and Abdul Malik Genaizia, the chief of staff, taking three of the six seats on the council, Mr Ghozali was unconvincing.
By January 14th the generals had dreamt up another constitutional stratagem. A five-member State Council was formed to take over the duties of president. The figurehead in this collective presidency is Mohammed Boudiaf, a veteran leader of Algeria's revolution, brought home from nearly 30 years of exile in Morocco for the purpose. The man who matters is General Nezzar.
The FIS has called on ""veterans, religious leaders, thinkers, preachers, army officers, soldiers...and all who love wounded and struggling Algeria to close ranks against this quisling ruling clique."" But it has denounced violence. The party is in a quandary. If it does too much, it risks being put down by force and finding itself outlawed (which may well happen anyway); if it does too little, the wilder men on its flank could take over the banner of militant Islam.
Algerians are predictably divided in their reactions. But many, who had no time for the fundamentalists, express dismay at the army's decision to abort the process of democratisation. The three political parties that won seats in the first round have all condemned the coup. The National Liberation Front, the old ruling party which came a bad third in the election, says it deplores the suspension of the constitution and has called for the country's political parties to form an alliance; its leaders have been discussing plans with the fundamentalists. Much of this maybe disingenuous. Yet there is genuine fear that the army has courted disaster with its intervention."

Where do customers fight over Mercedes sports cars that sell for $400,000? In the capital of which Arab state does a square metre of land fetch $5,000--and some belly dancers shake down that sum in a single night?
This is not some gilt-edged petro-sheikhdom. It is Egypt, a country of 58m people whose foreign debt of $35 billion nearly equals its GDP, where a typical monthly wage is $50, and the rubbish is collected by small dirty children in rickety donkey-carts.
The Egyptian economy has long provided contrasts as sharp as those between the lush Nile Valley and the surrounding desert. The contrasts have recently grown starker as President Hosni Mubarak pursues reforms aimed at weaning his countrymen from 30 years of expecting the state to provide secure jobs and cheap food, energy, housing, medicine and schools.
The legacy of Egypt's experiment with nationalisation and central planning is nearly as calamitous as Eastern Europe's. Almost half the workforce is paid--miserably--by the state. Five hundred overstaffed, debt-ridden, inefficient state-owned companies account for the bulk of industrial output. Theoretically free, public services like health and education have worn down under pressure from overcrowding and private competition. Without subsidies that keep the price of bread at under two American cents for a 115-gram (four-ounce) loaf, many would go hungry.
But East European economists would envy Egypt. It is awash with capital, much of it earned by the 3m Egyptians working abroad. A decade of lavish foreign aid has upgraded much of the infrastructure to world standards. Last year creditors, grateful for Egypt's crucial support in the Gulf war, cancelled $15 billion in debts and rescheduled $10 billion on easy terms. Oil, tourism and the Suez Canal bring in $5 billion a year, and private-sector exports to lucrative markets in the Gulf and in Europe, though small, are growing fast.
The question is, what is holding Egypt back from sustained growth on the model of, say, Turkey? The IMF, the World Bank and their supporters think they know the answer, and have devised a reform programme that they cajoled the Egyptian government into signing in May of last year.
So far all has one smoothly. The imposition of realistic interest rates has made Egypt's currency stable and freely convertible for the first time in memory. A new sales tax looks like cutting the budget deficit to a manageable 10% of GDP. Much of the budget shortfall is now financed by high-yield treasury bonds rather than loans, brining greater fiscal stability. Despite grumbling, the public has swallowed stiff price rises for fuel, electricity and communications.
But the government is only half way through its programme. Ultimately, all prices, including that of bread, are meant to reach what the World Bank calls world levels--that is, levels paid by people earning many times what Egyptians earn. Sooner or later, rationalisation of state industry will require massive layoffs; unemployment is at 13%, and much higher among the young.
Subsidies and official overstaffing may be inefficient, but they are Egypt's only system for redistributing wealth. Working class families, never able to do more than make ends meet, have now started to do without. Nutritional disease from high-starch, low-protein diets is spreading. Parents are sending fewer children to school because they cannot afford uniforms, books and the private lessons that are needed to pass exams. The high cost of children may even have affected the birthrate; the population is growing by about 2.7% a year, frighteningly fast but slower than before.
Such problems are the very ones that kept the government from imposing reforms when they were first recommended over a decade ago. Then, memories were ripe of the 1977 riots in which scores of Egyptians died and which obliged the government to retract a doubling of bread prices. Now, officials worry about more recent trouble in neighbouring countries. Riots in Jordan two years ago forced government concessions. The Algiers riots of 1988 were the start of the present unrest in Algeria.
Concern for stability explains some of Egypt's hesitancy over reform. Critics note other causes. Like every bureaucracy, Egypt's has a vested interest in its monopoly of patronage. Byzantine rules for investment and trade have been streamlined, but obstacles still abound. So far the only state holding to be privatised are shares in small and joint ventures. There are no plans to divest heavy industries.
Businessmen complain of growing corruption. ""Maybe bureaucrats feel it's their last chance,"" said a commodities trader who prudently declined to be named. ""Whatever the reason, they're getting greedy, and that's bad for business."" Still, trade, tourism and private industry are booming. If Egypt can get over the prices hurdle and cut through the thicket of state controls, it could emerge, to general amazement, as the fastest growing Mediterranean economy."

Four of his critics, including a former vice-president, have been arrested since January 11th, charged with spreading rumours that President Daniel arap Moi plans to stage a coup and cancel his promise to hold multi-party elections.
For the first decade after he became president in 1978, Mr Moi was useful to most of Kenya's lobbies, tribes and interest-groups. His utility seems to have run out. He put his friends into top jobs and amassed a fortune, while leaving room for many other Kenyans to enrich themselves too. But now the corruption that thrives under his rule scares off foreign investors. Governments and international agencies are unwilling to lend to a country run by an unstable single party. Lack of investment has taken the cream off the profits. The president's old allies, in business and in politics, are scrambling to replace him.
Optimists argue that the country's peculiar tensions give it the chance, if set free, of becoming Africa's first competitively dynamic economy. Pessimists hold that free voting would tear the country apart, unleashing tribal rivalries and racial antagonisms--especially against the Asian trading community, some of whose members have done well under Mr Moi.
The optimists welcome the disarray within the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU). In 1982 all rival parties were formally banned. In December 1881, under pressure from creditors and aid donors, Mr Moi legalised them once more, indicating that he would hold free elections, probably in 1992. He still censors publications that criticise him, and detains his critics.
Some of the talk he wishes to silence began with a commission of inquiry (which the president has since wound up without a conclusion) into the murder, in February 1990, of the then foreign minister, Robert Ouko. It heard evidence casting suspicion on men close to Mr Moi, the two most senior of whom (including a minister, Nicholas Biwott) were detained, then released on his orders. Since then five other ministers have left KANU and the government, some (including the party chairman, Peter Arino) sacked for ""disloyalty"" to the president, some (including a former vice-president, Mwai Kibaki, who has formed his own party) of their own volition.
Yet the opposition has not taken shape. The main group, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD), did as much as it dared to stand up against Mr Moi while it was still illegal. Its members are therefore slow to welcome new defectors from the KANU government that they opposed. Moreover, Robert Ouko was a Luo and Luo-speakers are prominent in FORD. That is widely thought to be the reason why Mr Kibaki, from Kenya's largest tribe, the Kikuyu, will not join them. The return to Kenya of several eminent exiles and fugitives may help pull the movement together again. High hopes are placed on Kenneth Matiba, an affable, well-connected businessman who was maltreated by Mr Moi's people, and is Kikuyu.
Mr Moi swears that his party alone can rise above tribalism and unite the nation, and that it will therefore win any fair vote. If he is right, Kenya will not be reformed. But if he changes his mind and starts to think he might lose, the opposition may have something else to worry about. Since 1982, when some air-force officers attempted a coup, Mr Moi has promoted his own men--often from his own Kalenjin tribe--within the armed forces. The president's critics believe that he cannot afford to lose an election to people who might investigate his income while in office. if that looked likely, they think, he would call upon his faithful soldiers to ""restore order""."

Their timing could not have been worse. During their summary trial, three Cuban policemen were killed by people seeking to flee the country by boat. The two incidents were just what the Cuban authorities needed to spur on their latest anti-American campaign.
Violent crime is rare in Cuba. Gruesome photographs of the dead policemen were spread across the normally tedious Communist Party newspaper, Granma. President Fidel Castro and his brother Raul, the vice-president, laid the blame for the murders on the fact that the United States welcomes Cuban immigrants.
As for the infiltrators, the Supreme Court commuted the death sentence on one of them, and confirmed the sentences on the other two. The Council of State, which formally runs Cuba, must decide whether the men are to be shot. In the past, infiltrators have usually been sentenced, then sent back to Miami. But the Castros are ready to kill their enemies when severity brings them advantage. They want to blame imperialist machinations--the luring of refugees from Cuba, and the sending of infiltrators into it--for their country's troubles.
The end of Soviet subsidies means tighter rationing of food, fuel and clothing, and a consequent growth of the black market. That provokes the unrest the ruling party fears. The claim of a planned invasion from the United States provides an excuse for political harshness. But, although the United States may condemn the speed with which the death sentences were handed down, it can hardly criticise the sentences themselves. The Americans also practise capital punishment, and the infiltrators had probably broken the law that forbids American residents to attack countries not at war with the United States.
The incidents may make it harder for Americans to defend the genuine victims of Cuba's renewed oppression. The police have recently arrested several members of a human-rights group called Criterio Alternativo, including Maria Elena Cruz Varela, who won a coveted Cuban prize for her poetry in 1989. In September 1991 she wrote openly to Fidel Castro, saying he should not ignore opposition to his rule. In November Ms Cruz Varela was jailed for two years, after a period of cruel harassment by Rapid Response Brigades--neighbourhood groups praised by Fidel Castro on the round that they ""really frighten the enemy...The masses do not stand on ceremony or anything, and if there has to be a clash, they will have a clash.""
In Havana in early January, 19 members of another anti-Castro group, the Cuban Democratic Coalition, were arrested while speaking on the telephone to a Miami radio station run by the biggest anti-Castro exile group, the Cuban American National Foundation. One of those detained, Carlos Gato Casals, provided a live commentary on the raid, saying: ""They can jail us and they can kill us, but they cannot kill our ideas."" More arrests may follow soon. The bungling infiltrators from Miami were found to be carrying an address book with the names of known anti-Castro dissidents.
The senior ideologue in Cuba's Politburo, Carlos Aldana, recently put the number of anti-Castroites in the country at around 1,000, of whom he claimed only 100 are full-time activists. He called them ""squalid, counter-revolutionary garbage"", and said that anybody proposing ""to surrender, to cease hostilities, or to reach agreements that differ from the total recognition of the absolute independence of Cuba"" should be punished ""with the penalty established for traitors to the nation""."

""So you see,"" yells a Mozambican over the music, ""it's not all war."" But signs of war linger on. As cars draw up, small boys rush forward and beg for the right to guard them; hours later a child liners on, waiting for his tiny fee.
The capital swarms with street children, most of them separated from their parents during attacks by the Renamo rebels in the countryside. Refugees of all ages live in shanties on the outskirts. Even there they are liable to sudden raids by rebels, by gangsters, and by the unauthorised pressgangs that conscript men under 30 into the army. Peace talks drag on in Rome, still with no solution in sight.
Yet a sort of economy is coming to life in the Mozambican capital. Under its old name of Lourenco Marques, Maputo's vinho verde, spicy prawns, sandy beaches and friendly girls attracted hordes of tourists from South Africa. After 15 years a few adventurous ones are starting to turn up again. Idyllic offshore islands offer cheap holidays away from it all. Two half-built hotels stand on the coast road north. One, the Four Seasons, is a skeleton. Portuguese builders began it in the early 1970s, and when independence loomed they poured cement down the lift-shafts, packed their tools and left along with the rest of the colony's skilled workers. Farther along and 16 years later, South Africans are building its successor.
In the city the famous Polana Hotel is being smartened up, and cafe life has begun again. Advertisements for fridges interrupt the absurd Brazilian soap-operas on television. Traders, consultants and photocopyists are setting up shop, although stiff constraints on credit push many borrowers into bankruptcy. Everywhere people are learning English, the common language of all five neighbouring countries. Even the ravaged farms are reviving, although threatened this year by drought.
Prakash Ratilal, a former governor of the central bank who is now a private consultant, looks forward seven or ten years to a revival of the old economy based on farming, fishing and services, with Mozambican ports shipping out tobacco from Zimbabwe, sugar from Swaziland, even manufactured goods from South Africa. For now, though, getting goods in and out of the ports is a manager's nightmare.
The government, converted from Marxism, is still feeble. Many competent officials, fed up with salaries worth $150 a month good money by Mozambican standards), take off for private industry or foreign employers, leaving second-raters to do their jobs. A senior official on his way out says that, though the government has officially abandoned its statist excesses, many administrators do not understand the market they are meant to encourage, and reckon the only way to influence prices is by crude controls.
Frelimo, the ruling party, is paying dear for years of bungled idealism. Corruption at the top cuts at its local support and angers its foreign friends; Sweden, which has stood by it for years, threatened in December to cut off aid worth $100m a year unless the government cleans up its act. At the election due later this year, several newly legalised parties could do well if they get organised. Even Renamo, which has concentrated more on terrorism than on gaining friends, could win a couple of provinces. Mozambique's stylish president, Joaquim Chissano, is undoubtedly popular, and claims the credit for abandoning communism. As his East European counterparts have found, that may not be enough to save his party."

Oddly, in some ways they are right, despite mounting foreign criticism that the Germans are again getting too big for their boots.
The critics seem to have a good case. With their economic might, the 78m Germans are already gaining unmatched influence over the vulnerable states in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. This could be the basis for a pushier new Ostpolitik. With a holier-than-thou arrogance that grated, Germany has frog marched its reluctant EC partners into recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. At home, it has been pushing up its interest rates, ignoring the objections from European neighbours wobbling on the brink of recession. As for culture, it is pressing for German to be adopted as a third official language in the EC. And all this only 15 months after winning unity. If the Germans try to assure the world that they are still ""completely 'umble"", they are bound to be disbelieved.
Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, certainly does not feel humble about being excluded from gatherings of the great and the powerful. He is reportedly miffed at John Major's decision to call a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Soviet break-up. In Mr Kohl's eyes, this looks like a way of talking about the issue without Germany, a country more affected than most. Mr Kohl has said that the question of a permanent Security Council seat for Germany is ""not current""; but this is the sort of incident that might make the current flow.
When pushed, German diplomats acknowledge that their style has changed a bit. Yes, the foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, eventually talked tough in December over Yugoslavia--but then the government had previously held back to try to win an EC consensus. Yes, Mr Genscher's drive for an agreement to scrap all short-range atomic weapons may irritate nuclear-power France; but the danger of ""local"" nuclear wars in the East outweighs that of putting further strains on Franco-German relations.
Besides, diplomats say, a year ago the Germans were being criticised for keeping their heads down in the Gulf war and lampooned because they told opinion polls that they would love to be like the neutral Swiss. Now they are accused of flexing their muscles. Just what role does the rest of the world expect Germany to play?
The world may not be sure, but then neither are the Germans. If anything they are less certain now than when the country was still divided and occupied. For the decades of the cold war West Germany acted as NATO's front-line ally and the East's favoured capitalist trading partner. That was an uncomfortable double-act, but in time a familiar one which the Germans performed with skill. Small wonder that now they feel disoriented and have not fully thought through the policies to match their newly won sovereignty.
Germany has been passionate about recognising Croatia and Slovenia but is not ready, allegedly for constitutional reasons, to take par in an international force there to help keep the peace. As a result, it may end up paying much of the bill for those countries (like France) that are ready to send troops--a mini-repeat of the Gulf-war fix that cost Germany a lot in both cash and kudos. A year ago a big debate was promised over Germany's future role ""out of area"", as NATO jargon has it. But the debate has never really got going, despite an occasional prod from Mr Kohl and a still more occasional one from Mr Genscher.
The Germans complain that they are paying more than their fair share to help the emerging democracies in the East. So they probably are. But their spending has been largely a result of cheque-book diplomacy whose costs streaked ahead even of rich Germany's ability to pay. The government also underestimated the bill for unity, raised taxes late, left wasteful subsidies in western Germany untouched, and over-borrowed.
So the recent German interest-rate rise was not so much a sign of ""muscle-flexing"" as of a worried Bundesbank trying to counter the inflationary danger of a weak fiscal policy. The Bundesbank's action also made it clear that, if the government does not get its priorities right in the East and its finances in order, the prospects for the European economic and monetary union (EMU) it says it wants will be dim indeed. Damaging the prospects for EMU may not bother the many Germans who yearn for a united Europe in principle but do not want their beloved D-mark replaced by an ecu; eastern Germans, in particular, have just been through one currency upheaval and are not keen to face another.
On top of the financial strains are the still tougher psychological problems involved in knitting the two Germanies together. Anyone who imagined that tearing down the Berlin Wall and handing D-marks to the east would produce a Germany brimming with self-confidence has had to think again. Mr Kohl may be right to forecast that eastern Germany will be blooming economically within five years, but it looks like taking a lot longer than that for easterners and westerners to feel they are really part of the same nation. Many Germans on both sides of the now non-existent border still talk about their countrymen druben--meaning ""over there"".
Adding to the sense of disorientation is the crisis brewing in the federal system that has served West Germany so well for 40 years. Part of its cause is the controversial decision to move government and Bundestag from Bonn to Berlin (although some ministries will stay behind). Then there is the need to shift still other federal bodies, and tens of thousands of jobs, from west to east to try to ensure a fair distribution nationwide. But most of all there is a growing recognition that the addition of the five poor eastern Lander to the federation must force a change in the system of federal-regional financing and, through mergers, probably in the make-up of the Lander themselves. Germans living in states to be merged away will not give up without a battle. For many the local Land offers a sense of identity--of Heimat--which the federal republic itself does not.
Aren't all these temporary problems, which Germans will largely master over the next decade or so? And afterwards won't their country really find a political role to match its potential? Probably. The sense of power produced by the sight of other Europeans doing what Germany wants when Germany shouts orders (as it did over Yugoslavia) may eventually prove intoxicating.
But for the present Germany has only a shaky base from which to pursue a more assertive foreign policy--let alone to take the leadership in Europe. Arm-twisting on Yugoslavia, unusual action though it was for Germans, does not change that."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224158197/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/27?accountid=14657,"Throughout the Fifth Republic the independence of the French nuclear deterrent has been sacrosanct. It has formed the basis of the enviable consensus on defence in France. It has underpinned France's image of itself as a leading world power. Now, for the first time, a French president has put a question-mark over the continuation of that policy of strict national independence.
Speaking at a conference in Paris on January 10th, President Mitterrand noted that only two of the 12 EC states--France and Britain--possessed nuclear forces. ""They have a clear doctrine for their national defence,"" he said. ""Is it possible to imagine a European doctrine? That question will very quickly become one of the major issues in the construction of a European defence.""
As usual with Mr Mitterrand's more consequential initiatives, his remarks came like a bolt out of the blue, designed as much to throw his political opponents into confusion as to open a real and necessary debate. With the end of the cold war, the push towards a common European defence and the eruption of small localised conflicts like those in the Gulf and Yugoslavia, many French policymakers had begun to realise that their defence doctrine had become outmoded. Yet to question it in public continued to be taboo. Asked last March, after the Gulf war, whether France should change its defence strategy, Mr Mitterrand answered with a categoric non, adding that France's ""nuclear-deterrent force is and remains the pivot"" of that strategy.
Behind the scenes, however, it was clear that a reappraisal of French defence policy was under way. For the past year senior French officials have been admitting in private that the development of a true European defence would be impossible without the eventual inclusion of a nuclear component. The ruling Socialist Party, in its new policy document adopted last month, also speaks of ""the impossibility of talking about a common defence without broaching the central problem of nuclear deterrence.""
Stressing the ""increasing difficulty of conserving the purely national character of French defence policy"", the Socialists propose an enlargement of the role of France's and Britain's nuclear forces with, for example, an extension of France's ""vital interests"" to the frontiers of the Community. Under the doctrine enunciated by General de Gaulle, France's nuclear force was to be unleashed when the nation's ""vital interests"" were threatened. Although those interests have deliberately never been defined, they were at first understood to begin at France's borders, and extended more recently (but before German unity) to West Germany's eastern frontier.
Mr Mitterrand has so far avoided giving even a hint of his own views on the public debate he has now opened. He will wait first for the right to show up its own divisions on the issue. Though the centre-right Union pour la Democratie Francaise is strongly in favour of a common European defence, many hardliners in the neo-Gaullist Rassemblement pour la Republique would be fiercely opposed to any idea of abandoning sovereignty over France's defence strategy, particularly where it concerns the nuclear force. French voters, polls suggest, are also divided. Though they are overwhelmingly in favour of a common European defence, many are reluctant to give up their national nuclear deterrent.
Speaking at the same conference as Mr Mitterrand last week, Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission and a possible Socialist candidate for the French presidency in 1995, suggested a wholesale ""transfer"" of the French nuclear arsenal to Europe ""if, one day, the European Community has a very strong political union"". Mr Mitterrand is said to have been horrified at such comments. More to his liking would probably be the kind of half-way-house arrangement that Britain currently has with NATO, under which France would continue to be able to make independent decisions about the use of its nuclear force, while putting it at the wider disposal of a future European government."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224135135/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/28?accountid=14657,"When the European Community's foreign ministers announced that they were recognising two of Yugoslavia's four breakaway republics, they had received learned advice. Yet the pair they recognised on January 15th--Croatia and Slovenia--were not the pair recommended by a committee of legal advisers led by Robert Badinter, president of France's constitutional court. The Badinter group said Slovenia and Macedonia met the Community's conditions for diplomatic recognition; Croatia and Bosnia & Hercegovina did not.
Applying legal criteria to such a highly charged political decision invited confusion from the start. The French and British were never keen on speedy recognition. Drafting standards for it, they hoped, might allow prevarication. The standards included respect for human rights as well as the more normal diplomatic tests for statehood: a single territory with a well-defined population under undivided control. But a month ago Germany made plain it would recognise Croatia come what may (and did so on December 23rd). At German insistence the Twelve set a January 15th deadline for granting recognition to any Yugoslav republic that wanted and deserved it.
Inconveniently, the Badinter group concluded that Croatia's constitutional guarantees for minorities were too weak for it to deserve recognition. Forewarned, the EC got assurances from the government in Zagreb that, whatever the constitution said, Serbs in Croatia would not be mistreated. But these assurances, everyone knew, were as flimsy as the standards they were supposed to meet: most of the Twelve would almost certainly have gone ahead without them.
Several reasons propelled the Community to unanimous recognition. One was the ceasefire in Croatia negotiated by the United Nations envoy, Cyrus Vance, on January 3rd. By Yugoslav standards it has already had a long life. If it continues, UN peacekeepers may replace the Serb-led Yugoslav army in three Serb enclaves it seized in Croatia. British and French diplomats had argued that recognition risked inflaming the war. As peace broke out, their argument collapsed.
A second reason came out of the sky over a peaceful part of Croatia on January 8th: a Yugoslav air-force jet shot down an EC peace-monitoring helicopter. All five on board died. In Brussels, any lingering desire among the Twelve to appear even-handed in the conflict vanished.
One other move may have been decisive. In return for German help at the Maastricht summit on European union, Britain's prime minister, John Major, gave the German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, his word that Britain would back Germany's line on Croatia. Britain's diplomats, from Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, downwards, swallowed hard. Britain's switch put France on the spot: it preferred to go along than risk the blame for breaking ranks by holding out against recognition on its own. (To save honour, France is not sending an ambassador to Zagreb until Croatia gives firmer guarantees on minority rights.)
The decision by the Twelve leaves three sets of hard questions unanswered. First, what happens now to the EC's Yugoslav peace conference? There will be no lasting peace until the status of the Serb-occupied territories in Croatia--and therefore of Croatia's international borders--is settled. Will Serbia continue to accept the Community as a peace-broker?
Second, what remains of Yugoslavia? It persists with the outward sins of statehood, but its government is a shell. The federal prime minister, Ante Markovic, resigned in December. (A Croat, he had clung on despite efforts by the Serb-dominated federal parliament to make him go; he eventually gave up, he explained, when 81% of the federal budget for 1992 was earmarked for the army.) Only Serbia, Montenegro and the two tamed Serbian provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina send representatives to the federal presidency.
Third, Serbia would like to lead a rump Yugoslavia. But Bosnia and Macedonia do not wish to be so led. Bosnia has declared independence but is taking its international rebuff gently. The republic includes Croats, Muslims and Serbs. War there could make the Serbo-Croat one look mild. As for Macedonia, Mr Badinter believes it merits recognition (maybe he should have taken a closer look at its treatment of its Albanian minority). Neighbouring Bulgaria has already recognised it (upsetting another neighbour, Greece). Yet the Community is holding back. The Greeks are saying that, because the republic continues to call itself Macedonia, it has designs on the region of northern Greece with the same name. For more EC regional aid, might Greece be persuaded to call its bit something else? No. Greek feeling about Macedonia runs deep."

But Mario Segni, a stubborn Sardinian and promoter of last year's successful referendum on electoral reform, is at it again. This week Mr Segni and his supporters announced that they had collected well over 1m signatures (more than twice the number needed) in support of two more referendums on voting reform. If the referendums are approved by Italy's constitutional court, Italians will vote on them in 1993--one year after the general election due this year.
When 27m voters turned out last June to support a referendum designed to reduce electoral fraud, the message seemed clear: most Italians were sick of corruption and keen for change. So Mr Segni hoped. The result, he said, would provoke an ""avalanche for reform"". Nothing, however, has moved.
Having failed to stir either parliament or his own Christian Democratic Party into action, Mr Segni is resorting to more referendums: to change the current voting rules for the Senate, Italy's upper house, and for municipal councils. He has a remarkable range of support, from Confindustria, Italy's bosses' union, to the Democratic Party of the Left (the renamed Communists).
His idea is to introduce British-style first-past-the-post voting for elections to the Senate, tempered by a small quota to be allocated according to the current rules of proportional representation. In elections for Italy's notoriously unstable municipal councils, the party that won most votes would automatically get an absolute majority of seats. These changes, says Mr Segni, could have a huge impact on local politics. He thinks the rigours of a British-style voting system would produce clear majorities, as well as making candidates more accountable to their voters. His critics, including the prime minister, Giulio Andreotti, a fellow Christian Democrat, dismiss the referendums and their unpredictable consequences as ""madness"". The Socialist leader, Bettino Craxi, is equally hostile.
Mr Segni and his supporters tried to get these two reforms put to the vote last year. Both were thrown out by the constitutional court on apparently technical grounds. Mr Segni hopes to have got round the court's objections by rephrasing the questions.
According to the Italian constitution, a referendum can be called only to abrogate existing legislation. This limits the options for would-be reformers-by-referendum, Yet the bug seems to be catching.
Three more referendums have been promoted by a committee chaired by Massimo Savero Giannini, a spry lawyer who helped draft Italy's constitution after 1945. Mr Giannini has come the champion of a movement to clean out what he calls the ""dead wood"" in Italy's bureaucratic jungle. His committee wants Italians to vote for the abolition of Italy's ministry for state industries, and of the Cassa del Mezzogiorno, the government body that distributes huge subsidies to the south. Mr Giannini also champions the abolition of laws granting the government the power to appoint the chairmen of hundreds of state-owned saving banks--a bid to loosen the political stranglehold on Italy's banking system.
The tiny Radical Party has sponsored three other referendums. One aims to abolish state subsidies to political parties (which last year amounted to just under 83 billion lira, or $70m). Another seeks to end criminal sanctions against drug takers. And a third would deprive local health authorities of their current (ineffective) responsibility for environmental controls.
The backer of all nine proposed referendums claim to have enough signatures to put them to the vote. But is nine too many? Mr Segni admits the voters may be confused. Mr Giannini, however, gleefully champions the current referendumania. If the Swiss can do it, why not the Italians?"

It is already being written off as a failure. Prematurely.
Within Russia, the speaker of the parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov, has called Boris Yeltsin's government incompetent and said parliament would replace it if it did not resign. This, together with sporadic anti-Yeltsin demonstrations, suggests the reform may be undermined by popular discontent and political infighting. Outside Russia, observers have focused on three criticisms: the extent of the price rises (so huge that no one can afford them); the still-empty shelves (which suggest the reform has had no impact on supplies); and continuing government intervention in price-setting (which implies that it is not a proper reform anyway). Some of these observations are justified. But the conclusion--that the reform is not creating a market economy--is not.
In a market economy, prices are set to match supply and demand. In Russia during the first few days after liberalisation, demand had nothing to do with it. Prices were set by suppliers. Shopkeepers merely offered goods for sale at those prices. (In economic theory, under perfect competition firms should be price takers; in monopoly-infested Russia they were price setters.) So prices soared by anything up to ten times--far more than expected by the government, which had forecast three-fold rises.
Worked out in terms of the number of hours it would take someone earning the average wage of 960 roubles a month to buy goods, a kilo (2.2lb) of chicken now costs 15 hours, butter 27 hours, and a pair of children's shoes 100 hours. If prices were to remain at such levels, the reforms would indeed be a failure. But note why: no one could afford to live in Russia.
That, of course, is absurd--and the constraints of consumer demand have already started to lower prices. Meat prices rose further and faster than those of most goods--in some cases by ten times. Unable to sell at such prices, shops rebelled. In Kursk, south of Moscow, shops even sent meat back to the farms, which returned it with prices lowered by 30-50%. This is becoming a pattern round the country. The importance is not only that inflation has begun to abate. It is that prices are starting to match up supply and demand--just as they should in a market economy.
That said, full market pricing has not yet arrived. Because shopkeepers have no experience of how much they need to run their businesses, the government told them to take a fixed mark-up of 25% of wholesale prices. This is a rule that should be scrapped as shops gain trading experience. The government also controls the price of 50 staples (like bread, sugar, vodka and matches) and basic industrial raw materials (coal, oil). It has sent a 12-page booklet to every shop explaining the ""coefficients"" (number of times the pre-reform price can be multiplied). And it has sent another booklet explaining how to negotiate with suppliers. This gives the impression that shops are awash with regulation.
They are not, but intermittent government regulation is still causing one of the main oddities of the reform: the large variations in prices between different parts of the country. Milk prices, for example, are supposed to be controlled. But in some cities, the regulation is being ignored. In Nizhny Novgorod (formerly Gorky), milk was being sold at over 8 roubles a litre (about 8 American cents at the market rate), compared with the official ceiling of 1.60 roubles, the prevailing price in other cities. Elsewhere, local authorities are intervening to cut some prices by giving suppliers subsidies.
With local authorities promising subsidies they cannot afford, and state enterprises promising rash wage rises, the government needs to enforce strict monetary controls if it is to prevent hyperinflation. Failure to do so would wreck the reforms. So could an outbreak of strikes, which many expect sooner or later. But the main charge against the price reform--that it is failing to create a market economy--is wrong. A return to a planned economy is now improbable, if not impossible."

Residents, who have been sheltering in basements for the past two months to protect themselves from nightly Azeri bombardment, have resorted to cutting down the city's trees to keep warm. The only lifeline to the outside world is a dangerous dash by helicopter to and from Armenia, whose cargo includes everything from petrol to the wounded on stretchers.
This was the inauspicious background to the launch last week of ""independent"" Nagorno-Karabakh's new parliament. Delegates sat hunched in coats and hats, often conducting their shambolic proceeding in near-darkness. Guards wandered the corridors with Kalashnikovs. Outside, the intermittent sound of gunfire came from Azeri positions on the hills surrounding the city.
An election took place on December 28th after a referendum earlier in the month which showed overwhelming support for independence (ideally, the Karabakh Armenians would like to reunite with Armenia proper, but reckon the current fashion for fission in the ex-Soviet Union makes independence a safer bet). The Azeris, who had been reserved 11 of the 81 seats, predictably refused to take part in the election, and stepped up their attacks to prevent the Armenians, from voting. As its chairman, the new parliament chose Arthur Mkrtchyan, a soft-spoken man in his mid-30s who ran a museum in happier times. He will have the unenviable job of trying to gain international recognition for his would-be independent state.
Nagorno-Karabakh's 180,000 Armenians are expecting increased attacks from the Azeri forces massed on its borders and around Stepanakert. Though heavily outnumbered in men and machines, the Armenian defenders claim to be better fighters capable of putting up a stout resistance. ""We are defending our land, our villages, our homes, our ancestors,"" says one. But the enclave's military leaders have no illusions about the odds against them.
Boris Yeltsin's decision last month to remove all but a handful of the ex-Soviet troops from the enclave left the Armenians vulnerable. The 1,200 troops of the Soviet Fourth Army still in Stepanakert--now subject to Russian control--in private admit their sympathy for the Armenians. But come an assault they are likely to concentrate on saving their skins. There is growing pressure on Mr Yeltsin and the other leaders of the new Commonwealth of Independent States to step up their military presence to keep the two sides apart. Otherwise the fighting may widen into a war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, possibly drawing in other powers, such as Turkey and Iran.
The Armenians hope that western diplomatic pressure will restrain the Azeris. In a speech in December at Princeton University, the American secretary of state, James Baker, criticised Azerbaijan for its ""aggressive policy"", meaning its behaviour in Nagorno-Karabakh. America has recognised Armenia as an independent state, but not Azerbaijan (because of its record on human rights). This at least reassures the Karabakh Armenians that the world is not abandoning them. The feel they need all the support they can get to prevent ""Azeri genocide""."

The Conservatives are trumpeting the success of their national health service (NHS) reforms. Labour is muted in its criticism and unclear about its own policies. Doctors are murmuring that the internal market is not so monstrous after all. Some Tories are even chalking up the NHS on their (admittedly short) list of possible election winners.
To see how odd this is, consider the position six months ago. Canny Tories worried that the NHS might lose them the election. To the Labour Party the reforms were proof that the Tories planned to privatise the NHS. To the British Medical Association (BMA) they were repugnant in theory and unworkable in practice. Family doctors (GPs) plastered their waiting rooms with critical leaflets and bloodcurdling posters. Newspapers churned out stories about cancelled operations and cash-starved hospitals, suggesting the NHS was ""unsafe in Tory hands"".
Why has the mood changed? Lately because the reforms have not produced the disasters so widely predicted. Two reports presented at a press conference on January 14th--a Department of Health study of the reformed NHS and an independent survey of trust hospitals--suggest the reforms may be starting to work:
* Some waiting lists are falling. Between April and September 1991 the number of people waiting for an operation for more than two years fell by 8,000, or 16%.
* Thanks to the performance-related contract for family doctors, childhood immunisation is at record levels. Immunisation for whooping cough has increased from 75% of the child population in the fiscal year 1989-90 to 90% in 1990-91:
* Hospitals are handling more patients. If current trends continue, they will treat 250,000 more patients in 1991-92 than in the previous year-an increase of 3.7%. Improvements in some areas are particularly impressive. There were 7.6% more hip operations in the first six months of 1991-92 than in the same period a year before. The number of heart-bypass operations increased by 5.9% and cataract operations by 5.5%.
* NHS trusts are delivering more patient friendly services. The independent survey of trust hospitals discovered that 48% of patients thought services had improved since their hospital had become a trust. Only 7% thought they had got worse. About 60% of patients said they spent less time waiting in reception and got more punctual service from medical staff.
There is some pre-election hype to all this. The projected increase in the number of patients treated in 1991-92 is only a slight improvement on the increase in the previous year, as the Labour Party was quick to point out. The number of patients waiting for more than two years may have fallen, but the number waiting for up to a year has increased slightly.
In fact, it is too early to pronounce the reforms a success. The internal market has hardly begun to bite. The contracts between purchasers (health authorities) and providers (hospitals) have so far been little more than a paper exercise. Ministers were so worried about radical innovations close to an election that they insisted all new contracts should follow historical patterns.
It would also be rash to predict that the NHS reforms will not cost the Tories votes. The government is using reserves of more than L200m to keep over-stretched hospitals out of trouble. Nevertheless, the demand for health care invariably exceeds the supply. Any botched operation can still be blamed on the NHS changes. The Labour Party will no doubt return to the offensive in the next few weeks.
For the moment, though, the government has certainly succeeded in wrong-footing Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman. Complaints that there has been only a slight increase in the number of patients treated is not what one expects from the man who claimed the NHS was close to collapse. Indeed, Mr Cook is currently failing to live up to his reputation as the government's most feared critic. He is paying the price for crying wolf too often. Remember his claim that the government was privatising the NHS? Health care remains (largely) free at the point of delivery. Or his warning that trust hospitals were opting out of the NHS? Patients are discovering that they are still doing the same things, only better.
Mr Cook is also belatedly trying to devise a health policy of his own. For the past few weeks he has been hard at work with his specialist advisers on a policy document which will counter criticisms that he is long on scare stories but short on solutions.
This will involve a delicate balancing act. His advisers are telling him that the purchaser-provider split--the idea at the heart of the Tory reforms--is fashionable with health reformers throughout the world. But constituency activists are hostile to talk of managerial efficiency and patient through-put. His supporters in the trade unions have had their appetites whetted by his repeated assertion that the NHS is underfunded. But the Labour establishment is bent on proving its financial rectitude. This week saw some tricky negotiations between Mr Cook and the party's Treasury spokeswoman, Margaret Beckett.
Mr Cook is not alone in rethinking his approach to the NHS. He will no longer be able to count on the knee-jerk support of the doctors. The BMA, though it continues to complain that the service is underfunded, has softened its opposition. This change of tack reflects more than just its innate conservatism--a factor helping any reforms that look reasonably embedded. Many doctors have started to see merit in the reforms. The most enthusiastic are GPs who have chosen to hold their own budgets. Budget-holders claim that they are providing better services for their patients. Some have negotiated better deals with local hospitals: a few consultants are now travelling to see the patients rather than expecting the patients to visit them. Some have saved money and employed physiotherapists and chiropodists.
Budget-holders are also relishing their new power. Young GPs used to look forward to little more than 40 years of pampering patients and flattering consultants. Many regretted leaving the prestigious world of hospitals. Now they can pore over fancy spread sheets and tell consultants what to do. In the old NHS, family doctors used to send consultants Christmas cards. Now it is the other way round."

Newcomers, such as A-Gas and Quadrant, have captured barely a tenth of British Gas's sales to large customers (not counting the as burnt to generate power). In contrast, the industry's regulator, known as OFGAS, has pushed and prodded its charge from every side. The latest scrap between the two, over how to give competitors a decent slice of the gas business, leaves their relationship in tatters.
On January 15th, after months of haggling, British Gas agreed that by 1995 it would try and relinquish half of the contract market (which includes the biggest 32,000 of the country's 18m customers and 35% of the gas that it sells). To help guarantee that its new competitors will face British Gas on fair terms, the company has also agreed that its pipeline business--which, for the moment at least, will carry everybody's gas--should be an independent subsidiary. Though harsh for British Gas, the alternative was an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that probably would have been harsher.
The new state of affairs is sure to bring benefits. A supplier that has a market share of 90%--especially one with a long history under public ownership--is unlikely to be offering the lowest possible prices. But it might also have drawbacks. One is the administrative cost of creating a separate pipeline company. A second follows from trying to introduce competition by setting market shares--a departure from the practice of regulating by price alone. To see why, look at British Gas's business as a whole.
In the winter there is great call for gas; not so in the summer. This means that during warm weather, British Gas has lots of equipment standing idle. The more that customers use gas all the year round or, better still, are willing to be cut off during the winter, the smaller the need for idle equipment. These sorts of customers are to be found in the contract market--exactly where British Gas is now to relinquish market share. As it does so, the cost to it of the summer lay-off will rise; its operation will become less efficient, and ordinary customers--without other suppliers to turn to--could end up paying more.
One answer would be to open up the market for small customers--something that looks as if it will happen only slowly. Meanwhile, there is a danger that British Gas's rivals will not gain the share of the contract market that OFGAS expects, opening the way for another bruising confrontation between company and regulator in 1995.
There is one consolation for British Gas. On the strength of the latest changes, OFGAS has agreed to look again at the agreement it struck with the company in April 1991. This allowed British Gas's prices to rise only five percentage points less than the rate of inflation, compared with two percentage points during 1986-91. Analysts do not expect much from the review; but British Gas, thoroughly fed up, is hoping for the best."

The government wants to put an end to that. The Treasury is now negotiating with the Whitehall unions to extend performance-related pay (PRP), which at present covers 5% of civil servants, to the whole of the bureaucracy. Under current plans, civil servants would be paid according to their five grades. Those in the top two would get more than the standard 4% increment and those in the bottom one would get none at all.
A survey of 390 organisations done last year by the Institute of Personnel Management and the National Economic Development Office showed that 47% of private-sector companies use PRP for all their white-collar workers. Two-thirds had introduced their schemes within the past decade. In most companies, according to work done by the Institute of Management Studies (IMS), around 10% of workers' annual increases are determined by their performance; in some companies, though, PRP covers the whole of the annual rise--and those at the bottom get a pay cut in real terms.
The commonest forms rely either on managers assessing the performance of their subordinates or on output targets for workers. The latter seem to work better--they make managers and workers think about their jobs, and avoid the problem that managers may favour their blue-eyed boys. The snag is that, in many white-collar jobs, output cannot be clearly quantified.
Proving that PRP succeeds in encouraging workers to perform better is hard. The IMS looked across a broad range of companies to see whether there was any correlation between PRP and fast-growing profits. It found none. But as the IMS's Marc Thompson points out, so many other factors determine a company's profit growth that this does not necessarily undermine PRP's claims. More curiously, as Steven Wood of the London School of Economics discovered in a study of 42 companies that use PRP, few companies bother to try evaluating the system they use.
Most personnel managers, according to Mr Wood's study, were in favour of their PRP systems; but then they would be, because they designed them. Solid arguments put up in favour of PRP were that it forced managers to evaluate their underlings; it gave them a way of paying (and thus keeping) high fliers; and it sent a loud message to workers whom the firm needed to get rid of. Managers were rather less sure whether it did what it is supposed to do--motivate people to perform better.
PRP can be expensive. Benevolent managers tend to class all their ducks as swans, a weakness that needs to be checked. ""In the short term,"" says Mr Thompson, ""pay bills tend go up. But companies think it will help them weed out poor performers, and there is some evidence that that is happening."" If the scheme is so miserly that it affects only a tiny proportion of salary--as is often the case--it is unlikely to motivate anybody.
There are other dangers. PRP is sometimes seen as unfair, either because the manager evaluating workers can get it wrong or because people's performance may be judged on factors beyond their control. And some see PRP as antithetical to teamwork, the other current management fashion. In America, where both came into vogue earlier than in Britain, some companies are giving up individual PRP in favour of group incentive schemes.
Mr Wood, who looked at both public-and private-sector organisations, found ""less enthusiasm about PRP successfully achieving its objectives"" in the public than in the private sector. There seems to be a sense in the civil service that PRP is being imposed by politicians, and that while merit is all very well, competition may destroy the collegiate atmosphere that makes civil servants feel comfortable. In America various PRP schemes have been tried in the federal civil service in the past decade, but there is still considerable opposition and no satisfactory system has yet evolved.
Research done last year by the London School of Economics into PRP in the Inland Revenue produced somewhat discouraging results. Some 12% of staff thought it had improved the quality of their work, while 80% did not; and 55% thought it had undermined staff morale, compared with 25% who disagreed. In the health service, however, there are already signs that paying doctors according to their ability to meet targets is boosting their output (see previous article).
Working more on common sense than on statistical evidence, most researchers conclude that PRP is not the miracle drug that some personnel managers seem to think it is. Well implemented, PRP by itself is unlikely to do much harm. Coupled with a properly thought-out system for training, rewarding and encouraging staff, it probably does some good."

There is even a broad consensus about what must be done. As Lord Justice Taylor made clear in his official report into the affair, the game needs to spend a lot more on its spectators.
What those in charge are now passionately divided over, though, is who should get L100m ($175m) of public money that has been allocated for improving grounds. Should it be spread around the 93 clubs of the Football League to spruce up a structure dating from 1888? Or should it be handed out in larger dollops to the 25-or-so (mostly first-division) clubs regularly attracting big crowds, to help smooth their way into a coming big-club, pan-European era?
The answer is due any day now. Uncomfortably for the government, the decision rests with Robert Atkins, the minister for sport. The ball has landed in Mr Atkins's lap thanks to a long pass from John Major.
As chancellor in 1990, Mr Major reduced the levy payable to government by the football-pools operators, on condition that the windfall--about L100m over five years--went to Football League clubs to help them improve their grounds. But he left it to one of the sport's own authorities, the Football Trust, to hand out the money; the Treasury simply stipulated that the beneficiaries had to be league clubs.
The league, however, looks about to come apart. After a series of meetings in the land of football officialdom on January 12th and 13th, the 22 clubs in the first division are ready to leave it and launch their own independent ""FA Premier League"" in August. The split will almost certainly be announced next month.
The pressure within the league has been building up for years. Its struggle to act on behalf of both the giants and the tiddlers of the professional game has bred frustration in the boardrooms of the biggest clubs. But their decision to make the break comes as a direct response to the Taylor report, and in particular the August 1994 deadline that it recommended--and the government backed---by which standing terraces must be replaced by covered seating.
The cost of such refits will be huge--estimates range between L10m and L20m or more for each of the top clubs. They think they will be better placed to raise the money if they can break free from the lower three divisions of the league. They hope to squeeze more out of television contracts, advertising royalties and sponsorship. But that is not all. They are also hoping to keep the lion's share of the L100m set aside for the league that they will no longer belong to.
Outrageous, say league officials. The quitters have boasted of lifting their revenues by L112m a year. Let them pay their own way, and leave the L100m for the other 71 clubs in the league--especially the 24 in the second division, which must also meet the 1994 deadline to phase out terracing. (The third and fourth divisions have been given until 1999.)
The government is sensitive to this line of attack, because the Football Trust has already attracted flak for giving grants to some of the richest clubs. One of the first to be promised a grant of L2m--the maximum for a single project--was Liverpool, one of the most famous names in European football. Meanwhile, other clubs with proud traditions but a depleted following are struggling to survive in the lower divisions. Without cash from the trust, many of them cannot hope to repaint their stadiums, never mind rebuild them.
League officials are also incensed that the secessionists should lay claim to money that derives, via the football pools, from the league's own basic business. The fixtures list (of which first-division matches comprise only a small part) is league copyright, and is sold to the pools companies. The league maintains that changing the trust's rules to give the renegades access to the L100m would be robbery.
The league, supported by second-division clubs (many in marginal Tory constituencies), is lobbying the government hard. So too are chairmen of the poorer clubs who have suddenly grasped the irony of the break-away plan. If the government decides in their favour, and the big clubs end up cutting themselves out of the L100m, the smaller, tottering clubs will have a much better chance of getting into the money.
BIG CROWDS, BIGGER PROBLEMS
The game's innovators see it differently. They fear a pile of money could be handed out to clubs with no real need for it. Why pay, as one cynic puts it, to replace crush barriers used mainly for tying up whippets during sparsely attended games? Given the size of their crowds relative to their grounds (see chart), the smaller clubs could easily afford just to shut their terraces.(Chart omitted) But this would oblige them to come up with a real strategy for the future--and strategy, for too many, still means airy talk of fresh local support and moving, one day, to a new ground somewhere over the rainbow.
The big clubs have to confront reality. They need to accommodate large numbers, so cannot just close their terraces. If they do not replace them with new seats, the Football Licensing Authority will ban their home matches after August 1994: the risk of public disorder, if huge crowds turned up with nowhere to go, would be too great.
The Premier Leaguers' arguments invoke the spirit of the Taylor report. Its main worry in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy was the welfare of spectators; so the L100m should go, they say, to where the spectators want to be. It may look anomalous at first sight for Liverpool to get L2m; but the money will help pay for a new stand that is costing the club itself another L7m--and more work will still be needed.
As this suggests, nobody should be in any doubt that the Premier League will need the trust's money. Even the glitziest of its clubs have more glamour than cash, with few managing to do much more than break even in a typical season. Despite their much-trumpeted hopes of raising L112m, they will probably be lucky to find an extra L50m a season. Compare that with the spending plans of clubs like Arsenal, which wants to spend L22m--with the trust's help--to turn its Highbury ground into a stadium that will bear comparison with the best in America and Europe.
If the government wants the leading clubs to emulate the best in this way--giving Britain a chance, one day, to host events like the World Cup--then it must now endorse their plans. Rewriting the terms of the L100m grant to include the Premier League will be a first step; another will be helping them get planning permission for their snazzier stadiums.
But the row over the L100m will have left its mark. If the small clubs lose their chance of being able to hog the pot, the full consequences of the Taylor report loom. Several well-known names will shrivel and die. Others will combine. A few will succeed against the odds and win promotion to the big time. But many a pair of boots will be hung up on the peg marked Hillsborough."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224140400/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/37?accountid=14657,"So the select committees of the House of Commons, those clusters of backbench MPs which embrace the dim, the wicked and the incompetent, as well as many good men and women, now think they are able to try private citizens? Why stop there? Why not lock them up under Big Ben too?
That seemed to be the implication of the social-security committee's determination on January 13th to compel two sons of the dead and disgraced press baron Robert Maxwell to answer questions in public about missing pension-fund money. Via their lawyers, the nervous-looking duo refused to speak up, arguing that they would be charged soon and that blabbing to MPs would end their chances of a fair trial. There was much angry harrumphing from the committee.
But its chairman--a Labour MP Frank Field--and his colleagues then shuffled back. They met privately and decided only to submit written questions to the brothers. Mr Field assured all and sundry that he did not want to prejudice a trial or ask parliament to punish the Maxwells. Surprise, surprise! Had the committee demanded a tough line from the Commons (which could include calling the brothers to the bar of the House to grovel publicly or locking them up), MPs would probably have blown a collective raspberry.
But behind this case is a much greater constitutional tussle: the endless one, under the Westminster system, between ministers and backbenchers. The real question is how much, if any, independent life should Parliament have, beyond providing the forum for the rituals of government and opposition. In theory, it is the cockpit of the nation's life, where independent-minded legislators guard liberties and query the activities of the state and its servants. In practice, it is a less bloody and useful arena. The rigorous party system has meant that too many MPs dream only of ministerial office and have little respect for their job or status as backbenchers.
Select committees are meant to help correct the balance. By gathering backbenchers across parties, they encourage them to think as parliamentarians, not as party yes-men. By enabling them to track particular departments for months or years, they give them a level of knowledge about government that few MPs would otherwise have. One chairman said they ought to be providing a third force in Parliament between the two big parties--and should get a third of the chamber's debating-time, too. Some experienced Labour MPs say that if their party fails to win the next election, select committees will become their main workplace in the 1990s.
Though famous select-committee inquiries go back to the aftermath of the Crimean war, the present-day system really dates from 1979, when committees were set up to monitor each government department continuously. Their members are chosen, in effect, by the party whips and they elect their own chairmen. The whips have tried to influence the choice of chairmen, but their meddling has sometimes proved counter-productive. Two current Tory chairmen, Michael Mates of the defence committee and Nicholas Winterton of the health committee, both benefited from whips' campaigns to stop them getting their jobs.
Some committee chairmen also accuse the party managers of putting forward more and more young, ambitious MPs for the committees who, with their ministerial aspirations will be more easily cajoled or threatened. Inevitably, the nearer to an election, the harder it is for committee members to try to stay outside the party struggle. One of the reasons for the pursuit of the Maxwell brothers may be that Labour MPs thought that chasing the missing money would be good for their public profile, while the Tories on the committee were not averse to publicising the misdeeds of a prominent Labour-supporting family.
Critics of the select-committee system say that governments like it because it keeps troublemakers harmlessly employed on important-sounding inquiries (sometimes abroad) whose recommendations can easily be buried. The best study of Parliament states brutally: ""Select committees have not made a general impact on government policies."" All too often, ministers briefly ""note"" recommendations made after long and complex inquiries. The last report by MPs themselves on the system, in October 1990, said revealingly that the chairmen of the select committees were hostile to being judged on ""a crude count of recommendations"" which had been accepted by ministers. Very sensible of them.
But select committees have had notable successes. The defence committee's pursuit of soaring costs on the Trident missile programme was one. Mr Field himself was heavily involved in an inquiry which discredited the government's system for assessing poverty levels. Sometimes suggestions which seem to make little impact, such as for changes in the tax treatment of forestry, trickle deep into a department's consciousness and emerge in policy changes years afterwards. And any minister or official tempted to break the rules of the cabinet game will surely pause first, and recall the grilling that the Westland-affair combatants received from committee members.
So the committees have had an impact on political life. And they have given backbenchers an alternative career to ministerial office. Their chairmen walk with an extra swagger and expect to be interviewed frequently by broadcasters. Committee interrogations, now televised, have been used lavishly on news bulletins. The 1990 Commons report on the committees noted wryly the journalistic hyperbole ""whereby every committee is described as 'powerful' or as an 'influential watchdog' and nearly every committee member, however recently elected, as a 'senior backbencher'.""
This has led overexcited committees to stray beyond their real role, which is to watch government and sometimes to whistle, loudly. Steven Norris, a Tory MP, accuses the social-services committee of evolving towards a surrogate judicial process: ""Select committees which turn themselves into 'when did you last see your father?' inquiries will end in tears"". He is quite right. Parliamentary committees which act as the citizen's eyes and ears in Whitehall are liberating. Those that try to act as kangaroo courts, even against unsavoury men, are oppressive. Mr Field, a good man, should bear that in mind."

But shortly after George Bush returned from his ill-conceived trip to Japan this month, the ""Third Decade"" council of the American Film Institute held a private conference. The subject: whether Hollywood, like a complacent Detroit in 1965, is about to lose its hegemony over the world's entertainment industry to hungrier, nimbler foreign rivals. If even the dream merchants of Tinseltown share the nightmare view that America is in inexorable decline, perhaps it really is time for drastic action to save American business?
""Declinism"" has been persistent in America ever since the first oil shock in 1973 shook the self-confidence which had characterised the country after the second world war. Since then, the success of Japanese companies in highly visible markets such as consumer electronics and cars, together with a flood of imported products from dozens of other countries, have seemed to add support to those forecasting America's economic decline. In the 1980s doom-mongering became not just the speciality of a few vocal jeremiahs, but positively fashionable.
Now, with recession dragging on longer than expected and an election looming, to say that American business can no longer compete and that Americans have lost their ability to innovate is no longer controversial--it is the conventional wisdom; All five Democrats seeking the presidency have, at one time or another, blamed foreign powers, especially Japan, for at least some of America's decline. And Mr Bush himself now seems to be abandoning his commitment to free trade in favour of the managed variety. There are even strong hints in Washington that the administration may be about to ditch its long-held opposition to the overt interventionism of an ""industrial"" or ""technology"" policy.
The problem is that the belief that American business is no longer competitive is wrong. Thousands of American firms, both big and small, remain among the most competitive and innovative in the world. The danger is that remedies designed to cure a supposed decline in competitiveness will actually help bring one about.
American firms lead in a slew of technology-based industries such as computer software and hardware of all types, microprocessor chips, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, new materials, energy and environmental control. Listing American companies that are world-beaters in many of these fields is easy: General Electric, Microsoft, Apple, Motorola, Cypress Semiconductor, Intel, Cray Computer, Compaq, Exxon, Dow, Merck, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Even the Japanese agree that America remains ahead in many leading high-tech industries. When the Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency surveyed 110 critical technologies in 1991, it concluded that American firms dominated 43 of them, Japanese firms 33, while European and others the remaining 34. Clearly American firms continue to innovate. Whether they will stumble in the future is another matter (see box on next page).
Outside such high-tech industries, it is also possible to identify plenty of world-beating American firms among consumer-goods companies: Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris, and Johnson & Johnson are among the world's best. Walt Disney is another American ""brand"" that can hold its own against any entertainment company. Time-Warner, squeezed as it is by self-inflicted debts, makes plenty of money exporting Madonna records and re-runs of American soap operas. In fact, American firms dominate the world's entertainment industry, and only a loss of self-confidence looks capable of shaking their grip. American films and television programmes are finding new markets in Eastern Europe and South-East Asia, as well as new media outlets, such as satellite television.
Ironically, nothing proves America's competitive advantage in entertainment more conclusively than Sony's $3.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures in 1989 and Matsushita's $6 billion purchase of MCA in 1990. Both firms could have built movie studios from scratch for a fraction of those sums and then challenged Hollywood directly, just as Toyota and Honda took on Detroit. Instead, they tried to buy their way into Hollywood with mountains of cash. America's film makers have always been happy to take anybody's money. They nevertheless remain American.
Service industries are another area in which America has world-class companies, though many services are not internationally traded, making international comparisons difficult. But where they are, such as the fast-food industry, America reigns supreme. There are no European or Japanese fast-food chains to rival McDonald's, Pizza Hut or Kentucky Fried Chicken.
One big international service industry in which America remains a clear leader is construction engineering--the building of sophisticated plant. Well-trained workforces have made Bechtel, Fluor, Parsons and Jacobs successful around the globe. ""Whenever there is an open competition overseas, an American firm tends to win,"" says Joseph Jacobs, the founder of Jacobs Engineering.
Merely listing America's many successful companies maybe missing a genuine average decline, as well as avoiding an important point: some of these firms now import as much as they make at home. The worry about America's loss of competitiveness tends to centre on its trade deficit. In fact, this has shrunk significantly (from $160 billion in 1987 to an estimated $72 billion in 1991). In any case, a trade deficit, by itself, says nothing about a country's ""competitiveness"". That requires deeper examination.
Start with exports. America's excellent export performance in the past five years hardly suggests that American goods are uncompetitive (see chart). (Chart omitted) Since 1986 the volume of America's manufactured exports has risen by around 90%, compared with average growth in the rest of the OECD industrialised countries of 25%. Even in 1991, as the world economy slowed sharply, exports of American manufactures rose 7%, compared with an average increase of just 1-1/2% in other OECD countries. This increased America's share of the industrialised world's manufactured exports to an estimated 18% by the end of 1991, up from 14% in 1987, not only restoring America's share to its level in 1980, but also pushing it ahead of Japan's current 17% share.
The star performer was the iron and steel industry: its exports quadrupled in the five years to 1991 in dollar terms. Exports of aircraft, electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals, telecoms equipment and clothing all more than doubled over the same period. Capital goods (ie, machinery and transport equipment) have risen from a third of total exports in the early 1980s to almost a half last year (see table). (Table omitted)
Far from being ""uncompetitive"" in manufacturing, America is actually one of the industrial world's cheapest producers of many goods. This is partly due to the cheap dollar, which has fallen by half from its 1985 value against the yen and the D-mark. But just as important has been the fact that America has the highest level of productivity of the big OECD economies. Data on absolute productivity are always years out of date, but a study using OECD figures shows that in the mid 1980s America produced amost twice as much for every man-hour worked, across the entire economy, as Japan. One reason for this is Japan's notoriously inefficient services. But even in manufacturing America's output per man-hour was roughly the same as Japan's; it was 50% higher than Germany's.
But, claim the doom-sayers, even if this is true, America's productivity is growing more slowly than that of other countries, so Japan is now pulling ahead and Germany is rapidly closing the gap. False. America's productivity growth for its entire economy (the figures most commonly waved around) has been the slowest of the big industrial economies in each of the past three decades, but productivity is difficult to measure in services, which account for more of America's output than that of other countries. Figures for manufacturing alone tell a different story. America did have slower productivity growth in manufacturing than Japan and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, but America's productivity spurted in the 1980s, growing by an average of 3.4% a year, faster than the growth in both Japan and Germany.
Not only is America's productivity relatively high, but its labour is also cheap. America's bosses may be taking home the world's fattest pay packets, but American workers are paid less per hour than in most other rich countries. In 1990, average labour costs (including non-wage costs) per hour in manufacturing were $15 in America, compared with $23 in western Germany and $16 in Japan.
So part of the price of America's competitiveness has been paid by factory workers. Real wages per hour have fallen by 13% in America since 1973, compared with increases of 30% or more in Japan and western Germany. Many use these figures as evidence of the falling standard of living in America--and hence the ultimate test of America's falling competitiveness. But fears about falling living standards are exaggerated. Once the figures are adjusted for changes in the number of hours worked and increases in fringe benefits and bonuses, and then adjusted correctly for inflation, real family incomes in America have risen over the past two decades.
More to the point, one reason why real hourly wages have not risen faster has been America's steady stream of immigrants who have been more than willing to take low-paying jobs, as well as women joining the labour force. Employment has jumped by a phenomenal 50% since 1970. The growth in low-wage jobs has dragged the figure for average wages down. However, America's remarkable ability to absorb such a huge influx of new workers is surely evidence of the flexibility and strength of its economy, not a weakness.
But what of the future? The biggest reason to doubt whether America can stay so competitive is its low level of investment. Last year capital spending by American businesses accounted for only 9% of the country's GNP, compared with almost 20% in Japan and 13% in Germany. Part of the gap between America and Japan reflects the heavy investment by Japanese firms in labour-saving machinery because of their fears about a labour shortage, now and in the future. American firms, with an ample pool of labour, probably do not need to invest as much to sustain output. Yet that only accounts for part of the gap. American businesses are clearly investing too little. The American government is also investing too little in infrastructure: 1-1/2% of GNP, compared with Japan's 5%.
So Americans should not be complacent. If a shortage of public and private investment continues throughout the 1990s, it could eventually sap the country's economic strength. Americans should also worry about the deterioration in the quality of their elementary schools. America still has one of the best university systems in the world, but basic skills such as reading have declined sharply among shopfloor workers. As the spread of computers encourages companies to devolve more and more responsibility to lower-level workers, declining reading standards could take a heavy toll. Already companies like Motorola and Ford are spending vast sums just teaching their workers to read. Simon & Schuster, a publisher, reckons that there is a growing market in America selling remedial-reading textbooks to employers. The market is already worth $500m a year.
But expressing concern about low investment rates and declining educational standards is not the same as claiming that America can no longer compete. If Americans heed the alarmists' cries, then frantic government efforts to prop up weak industries with trade protection or subsidies will almost certainly be the result.
Such measures would not only provoke retaliation from America's trading partners, they would damage the American economy's flexibility and openness, which have always been its greatest virtues. For example, the best and brightest of other countries have regularly sought to make their fortunes in America. Skilled immigrants from Europe and Asia have played a big part in building many of America's high-tech industries. An estimated one-third of the engineers working in Silicon Valley were born in Asia. Growing numbers of these Chinese, Korean and Indian engineers are now establishing their own firms in California, with the help of money from family and contacts abroad. If such firms succeed, they will help keep America competitive. In any high-tech rivalry with Japan or other East Asian countries, predicts one Wall Street banker, ""America will win because our Asians will beat their Asians."" There is no reason to be alarmed about that.
LEADING EDGE, TRAILING EDGE
Technological prowess is no longer invariably synonymous with good old Yankee know-how. But America remains one of the world's most innovate countries, as can be seen from its success in a wide number of high-technology businesses, from satellites to software. It spends more on science than any other country and its scientists publish more scientific papers than the EC and Japan put together.
Not all science is good science. The impact of a scientific paper can be measured by the number of times it is cited by other researchers in their papers. On this measure of effectiveness, American science still looks good, but it has one serious failing. According to research by the Philadelphia-based Institute for Scientific Information, the impact of American research papers in engineering, technology and applied science fell by 6.9% in the 1980s relative to the global average.
Looking at the products of companies, as opposed to scientists, there are clearly some technologies, such as liquid-crystal displays, where American expertise is not the world's best. That is a fairly new phenomenon. America also suffers some systematic weaknesses, particularly in manufacturing technologies and where process innovation is all-important.
Last year a panel of scientists and engineers from government and industry was assembled from the White House to look at ""critical technologies"". They found American dominance in a number of fields, notably software and biotechnology. These are both industries based on small companies with low capital costs which feed off each other and the rich pickings of government-financed university research. In other areas, though, the panel found evidence of a familiar problem--the best being the enemy of the good.
The aerospace industry and related military suppliers are good examples of this problem. Take materials. In many of the highest-technology applications, America has an undeniable lead, which is terrific if you want to make aeroplanes that fly into orbit. Lower down the performance scale, the lead shrinks. America may have the best ceramics for building jet engines, though the French have similar capabilities, but the Japanese are the ones using them to build car engines.
A large part of the problem seems to be that high-tech industries accustomed to dealing with the Pentagon become warped by the experience. Aided and abetted by a customer bent on performance at any price, they have become avid practitioners of ""technology push"" innovation, insulated from the competition that might deflect them towards applications and research with greater economic benefit. American innovators in this sort of high-technology industry try to push back the frontiers, regardless of the practicalities. This is a good way to achieve narrow technical excellence, but it does not help American companies in the race to establish global dominance of broad technological areas. For an aeroplane to fly, its wings need more than a leading edge."

This increased America's share of the industrialised world's manufactured exports to an estimated 18% by the end of 1991, up from 14% in 1987, not only restoring America's share to its level in 1980, but also pushing it ahead of Japan's current 17% share.
The star performer was the iron and steel industry: its exports quadrupled in the five years to 1991 in dollar terms. Exports of aircraft, electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals, telecoms equipment and clothing all more than doubled over the same period. Capital goods (ie, machinery and transport equipment) have risen from a third of total exports in the early 1980s to almost a half last year (see table). (table omitted)
Far from being ""uncompetitive"" in manufacturing, America is actually one of the industrial world's cheapest producers of many goods. This is partly due to the cheap dollar, which has fallen by half from its 1985 value against the yen and the D-mark. But just as important has been the fact that America has the highest level of productivity of the big OECD economies. Data on absolute productivity are always years out of date, but a study using OECD figures shows that in the mid 1980s America produced amost twice as much for every man-hour worked, across the entire economy, as Japan. One reason for this is Japan's notoriously inefficient services. But even in manufacturing America's output per man-hour was roughly the same as Japan's; it was 50% higher than Germany's.
But, claim the doom-sayers, even if this is true, America's productivity is growing more slowly than that of other countries, so Japan is now pulling ahead and Germany is rapidly closing the gap. False. America's productivity growth for its entire economy (the figures most commonly waved around) has been the slowest of the big industrial economies in each of the past three decades, but productivity is difficult to measure in services, which account for more of America's output than that of other countries. Figures for manufacturing alone tell a different story. America did have slower productivity growth in manufacturing than Japan and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, but America's productivity spurted in the 1980s, growing by an average of 3.4% a year, faster than the growth in both Japan and Germany.
Not only is America's productivity relatively high, but its labour is also cheap. America's bosses may be taking home the world's fattest pay packets, but American workers are paid less per hour than in most other rich countries. In 1990, average labour costs (including non-wage costs) per hour in manufacturing were $15 in America, compared with $23 in western Germany and $16 in Japan.
So part of the price of America's competitiveness has been paid by factory workers. Real wages per hour have fallen by 13% in America since 1973, compared with increases of 30% or more in Japan and western Germany. Many use these figures as evidence of the falling standard of living in America--and hence the ultimate test of America's falling competitiveness. But fears about falling living standards are exaggerated. Once the figures are adjusted for changes in the number of hours worked and increases in fringe benefits and bonuses, and then adjusted correctly for inflation, real family incomes in America have risen over the past two decades.
More to the point, one reason why real hourly wages have not risen faster has been America's steady stream of immigrants who have been more than willing to take low-paying jobs, as well as women joining the labour force. Employment has jumped by a phenomenal 50% since 1970. The growth in low-wage jobs has dragged the figure for average wages down. However, America's remarkable ability to absorb such a huge influx of new workers is surely evidence of the flexibility and strength of its economy, not a weakness.
But what of the future? The biggest reason to doubt whether America can stay so competitive is its low level of investment. Last year capital spending by American businesses accounted for only 9% of the country's GNP, compared with almost 20% in Japan and 13% in Germany. Part of the gap between America and Japan reflects the heavy investment by Japanese firms in labour-saving machinery because of their fears about a labour shortage, now and in the future. American firms, with an ample pool of labour, probably do not need to invest as much to sustain output. Yet that only accounts for part of the gap. American businesses are clearly investing too little. The American government is also investing too little in infrastructure: 1-1/2% of GNP, compared with Japan's 5%.
So Americans should not be complacent. If a shortage of public and private investment continues throughout the 1990s, it could eventually sap the country's economic strength. Americans should also worry about the deterioration in the quality of their elementary schools. America still has one of the best university systems in the world, but basic skills such as reading have declined sharply among shopfloor workers. As the spread of computers encourages companies to devolve more and more responsibility to lower-level workers, declining reading standards could take a heavy toll. Already companies like Motorola and Ford are spending vast sums just teaching their workers to read. Simon & Schuster, a publisher, reckons that there is a growing market in America selling remedial-reading textbooks to employers. The market is already worth $500m a year.
But expressing concern about low investment rates and declining educational standards is not the same as claiming that America can no longer compete. If Americans heed the alarmists' cries, then frantic government efforts to prop up weak industries with trade protection or subsidies will almost certainly be the result.
Such measures would not only provoke retaliation from America's trading partners, they would damage the American economy's flexibility and openness, which have always been its greatest virtues. For example, the best and brightest of other countries have regularly sought to make their fortunes in America. Skilled immigrants from Europe and Asia have played a big part in building many of America's high-tech industries. An estimated one-third of the engineers working in Silicon Valley were born in Asia. Growing numbers of these Chinese, Korean and Indian engineers are now establishing their own firms in California, with the help of money from family and contacts abroad. If such firms succeed, they will help keep America competitive. In any high-tech rivalry with Japan or other East Asian countries, predicts one Wall Street banker, ""America will win because our Asians will beat their Asians."" There is no reason to be alarmed about that.
LEADING EDGE, TRAILING EDGE
Technological prowess is no longer invariably synonymous with good old Yankee know-how. But America remains one of the world's most innovative countries, as can be seen from its success in a wide number of high-technology businesses, from satellites to software. It spends more on science than any other country and its scientists publish more scientific papers than the EC and Japan put together.
Not all science is good science. The impact of a scientific paper can be measured by the number of times it is cited by other researchers in their papers. On this measure of effectiveness, American science still looks good, but it has one serious failing. According to research by the Philadelphia-based Institute for Scientific Information, the impact of American research papers in engineering, technology and applied science fell by 6.9% in the 1980s relative to the global average.
Looking at the products of companies, as opposed to scientists, there are clearly some technologies, such as liquid-crystal displays, where American expertise is not the world's best. That is a fairly new phenomenon. America also suffers some systemic weaknesses, particularly in manufacturing technologies and where process innovation is all-important.
Last year a panel of scientists and engineers from government and industry was assembled by the White House to look at ""critical technologies"". They found American dominance in a number of fields, notably software and biotechnology. These are both industries based on small companies with low capital costs which feed off each other and the rich pickings of government-financed university research. In other areas, though, the panel found evidence of a familiar problem--the best being the enemy of the good.
The aerospace industry and related military suppliers are good examples of this problem. Take materials. In many of the highest-technology applications, America has an undeniable lead, which is terrific if you want to make aeroplanes that fly into orbit. Lower down the performance scale, the lead shrinks. America may have the best ceramics for building jet engines, though the French have similar capabilities, but the Japanese are the ones using them to build car engines.
A large part of the problem seems to be that high-tech industries accustomed to dealing with the Pentagon become warped by the experience. Aided and abetted by a customer bent on performance at any price, they have become avid practitioners of ""technology push"" innovation, insulated from the competition that might deflect them towards applications and research with greater economic benefit. American innovators in this sort of high-technology industry try to push back the frontiers, regardless of the practicalities. This is a good way to achieve narrow technical excellence, but it does not help American companies in the race to establish global dominance of broad technological areas. For an aeroplane to fly, its wings need more than a leading edge."

On the standard definition, Costa Rica's real GNP grew on average by 4.6% a year between 1970 and 1989. But its wealth-generating capacity increased more slowly. Conventional national-income figures record changes in wealth only when they pass through the market. When a forest is cut down and sold, the country appears to grow richer--even though the trees may not be replaced, and their removal may result in soil erosion, flooding, and the loss of food and fuel gathered by local people.
Environmentalists argue that such statistical oddities encourage policy-makers to behave as though natural wealth were limitless and technology could always compensate for environmental damage. They have the support of some economists, such as Robert Repetto of the World Resources Institute in Washington, DC. Mr Repetto has recalculated the national accounts of Indonesia and Costa Rica to try to reflect the impact of resource depletion*. He wants the United Nations, whose statistical office sets guidelines for the standard system of national accounts (SNA), to announce at the UN environmental conference in Brazil in June that the depletion of natural resources will no longer be treated as current income.
The SNA is indeed being revised, and some changes will take more account of environmental wealth, although not nearly as much as Mr Repetto would like. National-income accounts can be greened in several ways, each with its own band of adherents and critics. The most likely change in the SNA would be to include in the concept of national wealth those natural assets under the control of man. At present, animals and plants are treated differently: an increase in a country's livestock is counted when it occurs, but an increase in its commercial forests is recorded only when they are felled.
GREEN GROW THE NUMBERS
Those who criticise the way the environment is treated in national accounts tend to take one of three lines. Some argue that national wealth is underestimated, as in the example of growing commercial forests; some that output is wrongly measured, and that GDP needs adjusting; some that depreciation is miscalculated, and so net national product should be changed.
One way in which national product is exaggerated, say critics, is by the inclusion of spending on pollution prevention. Pollution does not count as a reduction of GDP; therefore, say environmentalists, cleaning it up should not count as growth. Conventionally, cleaning up oil spills or buying catalytic converters counts as final expenditure and so increases GDP. If environmentalists had their way, however, countries that ignore the oil and smog and spend their money on other goods would appear richer than those that spent money on pollution prevention. Besides, as Anne Harrison of the OECD points out, if environmentalists want to argue that pollution prevention boosts jobs and incomes, they cannot also refuse to count it towards GDP.
Mr Repetto has concentrated on a different argument: the failure of national-income accounts to allow for the depreciation of natural resources exaggerates net national product. Extracting those resources, be they oil or timber, may be counted as income when in reality a country is drawing down natural capital. His critics say he fails to think about what happens to the proceeds from selling such resources. If Saudi Arabia counts all its oil output as capital depreciation, it may appear to have no net income at all, even though it not only enjoys a high level of consumption but also invests some of the proceeds of the oil in ways that guarantee a continued stream of income in future.
When measuring the depletion of natural resources, Mr Repetto sticks to values which, while not measured in the marketplace, at least approximate market values. Costa Rica's loss of trees, for instance, is reckoned as the marketable value of standing timber and future timber revenues lost when the forest is cleared. His approach does not include other values which are harder to deduce from market transactions, such as the value a forest may have as a home for wildlife or a place for recreation.
Others are bolder. Peter Bartelmus, the green guru of the UN statistics department, is working on a manual for environmentally adjusted national accounts which should be ready in time for the Brazil conference. The intention is not to replace the SNA but to offer countries guidelines for satellite accounts which can be drawn up in tandem with the conventional kind. Working with the World Bank, he has already drawn up adjusted accounts for Mexico and Papua New Guinea, both of which will be published in a few weeks' time, and he is now setting to work on Thailand.
He attempts to calculate not just the use of resources included in the economic system, but also changes in environmental quality, such as increases in air pollution or loss of wild species. Valuing damage to such non-tradable resources is fraught with problems. Not only is it hard to make measurements, but there is controversy over what should be measured: the cost of restoring the environment to its previous condition (which greens prefer but which may be nonsensical if restoration is impossible), or the amount that consumers might be willing to spend to improve environmental quality (which is usually smaller, and may underestimate the value of the environment to future generations).
Most of these revisions reduce the conventional measures of wealth. But that may not necessarily be the case. Economists at the Countryside Change Unit at Newcastle University have produced one example. They have constructed accounts for Britain's agricultural and forestry industries. Allow for the pleasure given by the green belt and national parks, and throw in something for the effect of tree planting on mopping up global-warming carbon dioxide and, presto, ""sustainable net product"" is 25% bigger than net product. If environmentalists are to popularise the idea of green accounting, that is the sort of calculation they should encourage.

Mr Kerridge's departure was overdue, however. Last month Fisons revealed that two of its most important drugs--Opticrom and Imferon--had been recalled from the American market after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to give its seal of approval to Fisons's British factories. This may have wiped out a quarter of its 1991 profits (yet to be reported). British inspectors have also raised concerns. The Economist has obtained a copy of the FDA's report, which makes damning reading.
More than two years ago, industry analysts were already arguing that Mr Kerridge was in danger of running Fisons into the ground. This was despite good profits and buoyant shares--pre-tax profits rose by an average 56% a year in 1980-90, to reach L230m ($410m), while market capitalisation grew from L40m to L3 billion. Analysts said that Fisons seemed more like a miniconglomerate than a pharmaceutical business, and that the firm's small drugs division made it look precarious in an increasingly competitive industry dominated by giant firms.
The secrecy shrouding the company worsened relations between Fisons and City analysts. Fisons has only recently released its yearly R&D expenditures. Unlike its main rivals, which are far more open, the firm still does not reveal separate sales figures for its top products. And even before the recent withdrawal of Opticrom and Imferon, Fisons had twice managed to get on the wrong side of the FDA: once over an AIDS drug and then over Tilade, an asthma treatment. Although the FDA's committee eventually recommended approval for Tilade in 1989, it was lukewarm about data presented to support the drug's application.
If Mr Kerridge is to be applauded, it is for the way he saved Fisons from near bankruptcy in the early 1980s. In 1982 he took the bold step of selling the troubled fertiliser business, on which the firm had been founded. In the 1980s Mr Kerridge then went on to expand, through a series of purchases and sales, three main activities: scientific equipment, horticulture and drugs. Mr Kerridge's desire to diversify quickly was understandable. In 1980 a simple anti-asthma drug, Intal, accounted for most of the firm's profit. Two of the biggest purchases were the drugs assets of Pennwalt for $441m in 1988 and of VG Instruments for L270m in 1990. Margins reached 30%, putting Fisons in the same class as America's Merck, the world's biggest drugs firm.
Yet it was Fisons's wheeler-dealing that made analysts suspect that it might no longer be a safe bet. They argued that the company had turned to acquisitions as its main source of growth. Although these fitted well with the firm's portfolio of businesses, they did not go far enough in protecting it against the inevitable decline in sales of Intal, whose patents bean to expire in 1982. Though the company has managed to boost sales of Intal by finding clever ways to get more patents on new formulations of the drug, the firm has otherwise done little to fill the product gap--apart from Tilade, which still awaits final approval in America, the world's biggest market.
Moreover, the high margins reported by the firm may have been sustained because Fisons was stinting on R&D and capital spending--particularly on plant upkeep, if the FDA report is anything to go by. The report reads like a catalogue of shoddiness: warehouses had holes in their outside walls, even though temperatures should be kept constant; records concerning factories were poorly kept; transport vessels were stored outside, such that ""the possibility of rodent, insect or avian activity in the containers exists""; the firm's management reported to inspectors that the term ""pyrogen free"" at its facility did not necessarily mean that water was free of pyrogen. Fisons replies that such reports are usually critical and, anyway, it rejects some of the contents. Yet the FDA rarely goes so far as to recall products already on the market.
Fisons will be run temporarily by Patrick Egan, formerly a non-executive director, until a new chief executive can be found. Then Mr Egan will become non-executive chairman. Many predict that the new man will have to sell the non-pharmaceutical businesses and then merge the remaining drug interests with those of another firm. Mr Kerridge did not want Fisons to lose its independence. But with more and more rivals entering the fast-growing asthma market, most of them armed with huge sales-forces, takeover or merger looks inevitable."

That is just about the latest date possible if the round's final results are to be ratified by legislatures in time to come into force in January 1993 as planned. But the bad news is that the European Community's objections to the agriculture deal assembled by Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), still threaten to break up the entire package.
Mr Dunkel was obliged to act as arbitrator after the EC and America failed to agree on cutting trade-mangling farm subsidies. He thinks he struck a fair balance between competing interests. America and most of the 14-strong Cairns group of farm exporters would have liked him to have gone further. Others--such as Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Canada, which oppose plans to replace import controls by high tariffs--wanted rather less. But dissenters would probably have swallowed the deal in the interests of securing the whole package, if the EC had not given early notice that it would seek ""substantial improvements"" to the Dunkel draft.
The EC's objections are centred on the so-called ""green box"", a category of farm subsidies that do not influence production or price decisions. These would not have to be reduced, because they do not distort trade. But the Community says the strict criteria Mr Dunkel has stipulated for the green box would exclude its proposed compensation payments to farmers for price and production cuts under plans to reform its common agricultural policy (CAP). Unless the payments qualify for the green box, claims Ray MacSharry, the EC's farming commissioner, CAP reform--and the subsidy cuts required under the GATT accord--would be impossible to deliver.
The Community's trading partners do not seem inclined to give way. America thinks it has compromised enough. In an inflammatory speech to American farmers on January 13th, George Bush raised the temperature by referring to an ""iron curtain of protectionism"" encircling the EC. Cairns group members say putting the EC's proposed compensation payments into the green box would in effect emasculate the subsidy-reduction deal. Backing these arguments is the threat that, if the EC succeeds in getting the carefully balanced package reopened to its advantage, other countries will insist on doing the same, so unravelling the result of five years of negotiation.
Mr Dunkel has asked governments to exercise self-restraint in reopening the package. He has also declared his willingness to act as honest broker in agreeing changes to the draft. Some trade officials said after the January 13th meeting that even this was an open invitation to wreckers. They point out that uncertainty over the farm-trade deal could also sabotage the crucial market-access negotiations now under way. These complex talks, due for completion by March 31st, involve detailed country-by-country bargaining on specific commitments to make farm-subsidy cuts as well as reductions in tariff and non-tariff barriers to imports of goods, including farm products.
It remains to be seen how the Community and others will choose to exploit Mr Dunkel's ""fourth track"" allowing for modifications to the draft. (The other tracks are: the market-access negotiations; bargaining on initial national commitments to open markets to foreign suppliers of services; and legal vetting of the 436-page text.) Mr Dunkel says he has no better solutions up his sleeve than those negotiated or carefully chosen before Christmas. The question now is, does Mr MacSharry?"

In a recent interview in a French magazine, Abel Farnoux, the industrial eminence grise of France's Socialist prime minister, Edith Cresson, criticised the agreement for being ""harmful"" to Renault. Raymond Levy, Renault's chairman, disagrees. On January 15th he was quoted as saying that the agreement, which benefits both partners, ""should be allowed to live on.""
The reason for all the fuss? A typically Gallic mixture of thinly veiled Japano-phobia and political in-fighting. The French government, which still owns 80% of Renault, is concerned about the financial health of Volvo's car-making subsidiary, in which Renault has a 25% stake. The unit lost SKr1.5 billion ($260m) in the first nine months of 1991, mainly because sales in its three biggest markets--America, Britain and the Nordic region--were all in recession.
This has reawakened fears in Paris that Volvo might allow a Japanese firm to take control of its car business, leaving Renault with a minority stake in a Japanese car company, and a Japanese firm with influence over Renault. According to the French, the most likely buyer is Mitsubishi Motors, which already has a one-third stake in a Dutch car plant along with Volvo and the Dutch government.
Volvo dismisses this speculation. ""It has never been our intention to sell our car company to Mitsubishi,"" says Amaury-Daniel de Seze, a member of Volvo's executive board. He also says that the Swedish firm's lorry and aerospace businesses are still profitable and that Volvo is taking action to staunch the car unit's losses. Last year the group axed 8,300 jobs, or 12% of its end-1990 workforce. Most of the cuts were in the car business, and these helped Volvo to slash overall costs by SKr3.3 billion. It plans another SKr2.2 billion of cost-cutting this year.
Though no Japanese deal is imminent, Renault's Mr Levy has refused to rule out a future partnership for his own firm. This could reduce Renault's over-dependence on the French market. And it could help it in other ways too. Ford's links with Mazda, for example, have helped it to learn ""lean"" manufacturing techniques pioneered in Japan. For now, though, the French firm's links with Mitsubishi Motors are purely commercial. Renault is providing the Japanese firm with gearboxes for its Dutch plant and may soon supply it with diesel engines as well.
However, the priority for Volvo and Renault is to strengthen their link, thus making it harder for meddling politicians to separate them. Renault already sells Volvo 100,000 car engines a year and vice versa. And both firms are co-operating in areas like marketing, logistics, quality control, and research and development. But the key to success remains close contact between the two men responsible for the alliance, Mr Levy and Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman. There lies the rub. Mr Levy is due to retire in May. His preferred heir-apparent, and Volvo's preference too, is Louis Schweitzer, who was involved in negotiating the alliance.
The snag is that Mr Schweitzer is a former aide of Laurent Fabius, the new leader of the Socialist Party and no friend of Mrs Cresson's. Hence some see in Mr Farnoux's comments a deliberate attempt to ruin Mr Schweitzer's chance of taking over at Renault. However, Messrs Levy and Schweitzer may have a powerful ally in the shape of Francois Mitterrand, the French president, who wants the alliance to continue. So much for the claim that French politicians no longer interfere in state industries."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224145750/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/44?accountid=14657,"It was only a matter of time. Apart from exceptions like nuclear France and hydroelectric Norway, the high cost of energy and labour has cast a shadow over Europe's aluminium smelters. Now, with metal pouring out of Russia and Ukraine, and aluminium prices at record lows, closure is stalking the continent's smelters earlier than anyone had expected.
Even by the miserable standards of today's commodity markets, aluminium is struggling. Since 1988, a recent high, the price has fallen by 60%, to $1,100 a tonne. Producers have 3.4m tonnes of stocks, and the London Metal Exchange has stocks of over 1m tonnes; neither shows any sign of shrinking. For 75-85% of smelters, according to Canada's Alcan, current prices do not even cover running costs. In rosier times smelters were rarely shut down. Between mid-1991 and the beginning of 1993, 920,000 tonnes--6% of world capacity--is due to be shut. But it is too little, too late.
The recession is partly to blame. The Economist Intelligence Unit, a sister company of this newspaper, reckons that demand for primary aluminium (metal that is not recycled, but freshly smelted) declined by almost 1% last year, compared with an average rate of growth of 3.2% over the past 20 years. A boom in exports from the Soviet Union and now its fragments has made a difficult situation intolerable. The best guess is that exports (mostly from Russia and Ukraine) have quadrupled since 1989 and now stand at 1m tonnes a year.
Nobody knows whether these exports are coming from stocks or from smelters diverting output to the West to earn hard currency and to find new buyers as industrial customers at home run out of cash or go out of business. Most analysts expect exports to fall only slightly this year, but nobody can be sure that they will not collapse. European smelters cling to this hope. Buoyed by predictions that demand will grow by 4% in 1992, they have been loth to reduce capacity.
It is clear which producers would be expected to buckle first. Ever since the oil shocks in the 1970s, aluminium smelting has been moving to countries where raw materials--particularly energy--are cheap. North America's industry has shrunk by 12% since 1974; Japan's has been all but eradicated; Europe, with a third of the world's capacity, will be the next to suffer. According to Anthony Bird, an analyst based in London, it costs only 47 cents a lb to produce aluminium in Venezuela, where energy and bauxite are abundant. In Italy operating costs are 76 cents a lb and in Spain 72 cents. Even in Germany, where the latest technology is on display, making aluminium costs an average of 65 cents a lb. Ever stricter environmental laws are bound to put European smelters at a still greater disadvantage.
Yet, though European producers acknowledge the trend, they blame their present woes on incidental factors: strong European exchange rates as well as Russian and Ukrainian exports. They argue that while Russia's polluting smelters are being cleaned up, the world will need Europe's smelters. Hans Seebauer, secretary-general of the European Aluminium Association (EAA), wants the European Community to persuade the new countries to restrain their exports. If necessary, the association wants quotas on aluminium imports into Europe--there is already a tariff of 6%.
This is folly. The West cannot welcome Russia's freedom, only to turn back Russian goods at its borders. Moreover, given the decline facing parts of the European industry, protection granted now will be almost impossible to remove in future. During the recession of the early 1980s, American producers laid off workers, sold smelters to their managements, renegotiated labour and energy contracts and spent $15 billion making smelters efficient. European producers, most still tied to the state, must follow the same weary course, or close down."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224158271/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/45?accountid=14657,"The Japanese government is about to lend the officially sanctioned cartel which has stopped its shipbuilders from sinking each other in the midst of a prolonged downturn in world shipbuilding. Freed to compete, will Japanese shipbuilders--which account for 40% of the world's annual production--once again expand aggressively? Shipbuilders in South Korea, Taiwan and Europe worry that they will, and that this will spark a price war just as demand for ships, and ship prices, are recovering. Japanese shipbuilders say they will not resort to the kind of desperate price-cutting which brought the industry to its knees in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Twice this decade Japanese shipbuilders have sought the protection of cartels to set prices and capacity. Under the supervision of the official body regulating the industry, they have reduced the combined capacity of their yards from 9.8m gross tons in 1980 to 4.6m gross tons today. In the most recent contraction, some 44 Japanese shipbuilding companies were banded together into eight groups. All told, the industry's workforce has been cut from 275,000 in the early 1970s to fewer than 70,000 today.
But now Japanese shipyards are awash with orders. Almost half the world's merchant fleet (some 400m gross tons) is nearly 15 years old and will have to be scrapped within six years. Fleets of aged ships are expensive to operate. Banks refuse to lend money for purchasing ships over 15 years old. Ship insurers, who have raised their premiums steeply, are reluctant to offer coverage for older vessels.
Tankers are in the sorriest state of repair. Over half those in use today were built in the 1970s. Many of them were left idle, with little maintenance, until the world economy recovered from the recession that followed the first oil shock. Today's fleet is more dilapidated than usual. Experts reckon that some 150m gross tons of tankers will have to be replaced over the next five years. Japanese shipbuilders are expected to get 45-50% of the business--providing their yards with 15m gross tons of orders annually for much of the 1990s. How will they manage to meet this demand with a total capacity only a third that tonnage?
It may not be as difficult as it looks. The capacity restriction imposed by the Japanese government's cartel has been based on a complicated and obscure OECD definition of so-called ""compensated"" gross tonnage. This is used to compare the work involved in building different types of ships--an oil tanker, say, with a liquefied natural-gas carrier.
To squeeze more ships out of their capacity-restricted yards, Japanese shipbuilders have automated practically all the steel-cutting and welding, most of which is now done off-site in ""ship factories"" rather than shipyards. ""It took about a million manhours to build a supertanker in the 1970s,"" says Bruce Roscoe, an analyst in the Tokyo office of Goldman Sachs. ""Japanese shipbuilders now do the job in 270,000 manhours."" The only work done in the actual building berth is the welding together of huge parts already assembled elsewhere. The net result is that, while they may have been restricted to building no more than 4.6m ""compensated"" gross tons a year, Japanese shipyards turned out 10.7m tons of real ships in 1990 and an estimated 9m tons in 1991. With further automation and only modest expansions of their yards, Japanese shipbuilders should be able to produce 15m tons a year.
Meanwhile, it pays Japanese shipbuilders to pretend that they are short of capacity in order to help push ship prices higher. Despite recent price rises, ships are still cheaper in real terms than they were ten years ago. Mr Roscoe expects no Japanese shipbuilder to open a new yard until prices have risen a further 30-40%, even without the discipline of a government cartel."

Welcome to Thailand, or for that matter most of Asia's other superstar economies. In Taiwan, China, Thailand, Indonesia and, to a lesser extent, Malaysia, the telephone systems are pitiful. All these countries have realised that, in order to sustain their rapid rates of growth and to continue to attract foreign investment, they must make a great leap forward in the size and quality of their telecommunication systems.
South Korea proves such a leap is possible. In 1980 it had fewer than 2m lines. By 1991 it had increased the number to 15m, roughly one for every three people. It financed much of this growth by charging a $330 deposit for each new line.
South Korea's competitors are on its heels. Thailand is negotiating two contracts which will add 3m new lines, three times its existing capacity. China wants to have a national average of two lines per 100 people--with a higher average of 15 per 100 in the coastal cities and Beijing--by the end of 1994, an increase of over 5.5m new lines. Indonesia aims to add 1m lines a year until the end of 1999.
The state-owned monopolies which control telecoms throughout Aisa do not have the capital needed to catch up with demand, much less get ahead of it. So they are willing to negotiate with any supplier offering a self-financing project. The fiercest competitors for such business are AT&T, Alcatel, Siemens, Northern Telecom and Ericsson. NEC and Fujitsu, the top Japanese suppliers, often work together. However, this is one of the rare industries in the emerging economies of Asia that is not dominated by Japanese firms. ""They like selling equipment, but are not so keen on helping other people to run a system, which is what a lot of these countries need,"" is one western rival's explanation of why the Japanese are not dominant.
Although the pickings are rich, getting at them is not easy or particularly clean work. At the beginning of 1991, Thailand's civilian government announced that it intended to award the contract for 3m lines to Charoen Pokhpand, an agribusiness conglomerate well-known for its chicken-feed but not for any telecoms experience. The ensuing furore about alleged corruption provided a pretext for a military coup in February 1991. The government appointed by the soldiers has cut Charoen Pokhpand's share of the contract back to 2m lines and has re-opened bidding for the remaining 1m lines.
In Indonesia, rival consortia led by NEC and AT&T fought hard for a contract to provide a digital switch, capable of servicing 700,000 lines. After months of dithering, the government announced in early 1991 a plan to double the size of the contract and to award half of it to each consortium. Good news for everyone, at least until the government also announced that the consortia would be obliged to have as partners two local companies, which happened to be controlled by children of Indonesia's president.
Few local businessmen care about allegations of cash-stuffed envelopes as long as the service improves. This leads to the intriguing question: how have businesses managed to do so well when telephones are even rarer than they are in Eastern Europe? Part of the answer lies in cellular telephones, whose use is growing rapidly throughout the region. Ericsson sold 40,000 units in China last year at a price of over $3,800 each, three times what they cost in Hong Kong. (Unfortunately for Ericsson, the Chinese government pockets the difference.)
Philippe Annez, the World Bank's representative in Bangkok, suggests another part of the answer: ""The efficiency of a system and public access to it matter just as much as its size."" Thus, though few people in Bangkok have a telephone at home, there is always a pay telephone around the corner and nearly all businesses have a telephone. ""Where are the telephones in Eastern Europe and Russia?"", asks Mr Annez. ""They're on the desks of people who do very little in ministries. Here there might not be enough of them, but they are used to make money."""

Since then forecasts of losses and expectations for the task force have mounted in parallel. In November a MORI survey of ""names""--the rich individuals whose capital supports underwriting syndicates--reported that 40% might resign if it did not recommend big changes.
Many will be disappointed with the report that appeared on January 15th. That is a pity, for it contains valuable analysis and many excellent recommendations. It shows clearly that Lloyd's costs have grown faster than those of competitors. As a proportion of premiums, costs rose from 7% in 1982 to 13% in 1990--at a time when incorporated insurers were keeping their costs steady. As for market share, in 1900 Lloyd's had half the word's non-life insurance business; today it has just over 2%. It is still the second-biggest re-insurer, and it has a fifth of the marine and aviation market. Even so, Lloyd's is in danger of becoming a mere niche market.
The Rowland report argues against bowing to what some consider the inevitable. It wants costs trimmed by a third, mostly by continuing to shrink the number of syndicates and agencies. Capacity should increase in the 1990s, to match growing world demand for insurance. Growth is also the softest way to bring down cost ratios; and it might give names a chance to recoup past losses through future profits.
In 1991 Lloyd's had unused capacity: premium income was L8 billion ($14 billion), against the L11 billion that its available capital could be expected to support. This year 4,000 names have left, bringing the total down to 22,700 and reducing capacity to L10 billion. As rates increase and insurance business picks up, Lloyd's will need more capital. That was the central problem the task force faced--just like a committee chaired by Lord Cromer after big losses in the 1960s.
Cromer's solution was to lower the wealth hurdle that names have to clear; but that has been disastrous, for many names now can barely afford their losses. Instead, the Rowland task force wants to make the market more attractive to existing and prospective names, especially the very wealthy, and to tap additional sources of capital.
The task force recommends a new compulsory stop-loss scheme that would set a practical limit to names' theoretically unlimited liability for losses. Starting in 1993, any names whose losses over a four-year period exceed their annual premium-income limit will have the excess met by a new special fund. The task force reckons that payments into this Fund could be set at 0.25% of premium limits, on top of the 0.5% contribution to Lloyd's existing L500m central reserve fund and a 0.6% charge to help meet Lloyd's expenses that names already pay.
The other significant innovation is a pooling arrangement that would diversify capital across syndicates: a sort of unit trust for names, dubbed MAPA. This idea was rejected by members in 1990. Big losses since then may have made them keener.
Other immediate reforms that the task force suggests are bolstering names' rights in dealings with their agents, encouraging members to create bigger reserves and getting syndicates to add a bigger risk cushion for future liabilities when they close their accounts by reinsuring into a subsequent year. The last two would be easier if the Inland Revenue granted extra tax relief; the task force claims that British insurers get less generous tax treatment for reserves than continental rivals.
The most striking longer-term proposal is to allow limited-liability companies to join syndicates. They would pay in, as capital, a higher proportion of the premium income they wanted to write than individuals, but their risk would be limited to that sum. This change needs new legislation. But it could be crucial if, as is likely, relying on individuals cannot produce the capital the market will need later on. Other changes include putting a value on syndicate participation (perhaps starting a market in them) and reversing the requirement that brokers be separated from underwriters.
Like the Council of Lloyd's, names will support most of these changes. Yet the Rowland report will leave many dissatisfied. It does little for those who are suing from, and often suing over, current losses. Chatset, an independent analyst, reckons that the L510m loss for 1988 reported last June under Lloyd's three-year accounting system will be followed by losses of L1.3 billion for 1989, L1.1 billion for 1990, and L500m for 1991. That amounts to total losses of around L150,000 per name, with many losing far more. Already nearly half the existing names are in ""open-year"" syndicates with liabilities too big to estimate.
Members of the task force claim that they could not have done anything about past losses--partly because of cost and partly because names in profitable syndicates could themselves have sued, had Lloyd's tried to spread the burden. Cynics will say that the task force's job was to entice new names, not rescue old ones. The report also suggests that CentreWrite, Lloyd's vehicle for helping open-year syndicates, should allow individual names as well to buy their way out of open years. In practice, locking names in may be Lloyd's best course, for it will force many to keep underwriting in the hope of trading out of losses.
The Rowland report omitted several changes that many had urged: putting Lloyd's under the Financial Services Act; divorcing members' agents from managing agents, who represent underwriters; and reducing the three-year lag in producing annual accounts. Those who wanted these changes may not be satisfied with promises of more information.
That is partly because of one big worry: that the council might not implement the reforms. After all, Cromer recommended many similar changes 20 years ago. Suspiciously, the council has already rejected the task force's suggestions for shrinking the council's size, bringing in a full-time chairman, perhaps from outside, and distinguishing more clearly the business of running Lloyd's from market regulation.
Mr Coleridge and his fellow council members have been foolish in turning down these changes. A big explanation for Lloyd's woes has been its incompetent management. Change that, and the market's prospects would improve. Do nothing, and its decline might well continue--even if the other reforms are brought in."

There is still scant pressure from the finance ministry in Tokyo for banks to declare their mounting dud loans as non-performing; banks can report income from a loan for a year after a borrower has stopped paying. America's bank supervisors, however, are less inclined to be lax. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is now, for the first time, preparing to examine rigorously Japanese banks' American branches and agencies. Its scrutiny is likely to result not only in higher loss provisions against the banks' American loans but also in greater attention in Japan to the quality of their domestic portfolios.
Japanese banks have lent massively in America, and especially in California. They had 12.4% of American banking assets at the end of June 1990, or $408 billion-worth. A year later they accounted for 24.5% of all bank assets in California. Between 1986 and 1990 they boosted their share of property loans in the state from 10% to 20%, lending when property prices were at their peak. Prices have fallen sharply in the past year.
Concern has mainly focused, so far, on the activities of Japanese banks' American subsidiaries. The Japanese own the fifth, sixth and seventh largest banks in California: Union Bank (owned by Bank of Tokyo), Bank of California (Mitsubishi Bank) and Sanwa Bank of California. Union Bank announced in September a $90m provision for loan losses. Bank of California tapped its parent last year for $250m to cover loan-loss provisions. It has also sacked hundreds of employees, the first Japanese-owned bank in America to do so. Sanwa Bank of California may also start firing soon.
Because subsidiaries report their results separately, their problems are easier to spot than those of branches and agencies, whose results are wrapped up in the parent bank's. Yet it is the branches that are piling up the biggest bad debts. Traditionally, branches and agencies functioned as service centres for Japanese companies operating in America. Their role changed in the mid-1980s, when Japanese banks rushed to book assets abroad at infinitesimal margins. Branches earned a puny average return on equity of about 2%, according to management consultants familiar with their activities. These pathetic returns were well below what it cost to fund the assets offshore.
Japanese banks' foreign-lending frenzy peaked just as American property prices did. In the financial year to March 1990 Mitsui Taiyo Kobe and Mitsubishi increased their overseas loans by 45% and 37% respectively, while domestic loans rose by only 11%. The banks were especially drawn to hotels, syndications on office buildings, and the up-front fees on loans for leveraged buy-outs. Yet they brought no strengths other than cheap money. Their branches tended to be staffed by Japanese executives on a two-year rotation from Tokyo and by junior Americans who were obliged to let credit decisions be taken in Tokyo.
Their troubles are most evident in downtown Los Angeles, where virtually every new office block in the late 1980s was financed by the Japanese. The vacancy rate there is now 22% in prime buildings. The Japanese banks' error was to assume that the area is the commercial centre of Los Angeles, as midtown Manhattan is New York's or Marunouchi is Tokyo's.
The Japanese abruptly stopped lending in 1990, when the Tokyo stockmarket collapsed and took much of their capital with it. They are now trying to retrench. Their problem is that it is hard to sell assets which yield almost nothing; they can only cancel credits as they come up for renewal.
Assets booked through American branches and agencies may average some $15 billion-20 billion per bank. That is serious money, even for the world's biggest banks. According to Schaefer & Associates, an accountancy firm in California, the Industrial Bank of Japan is the largest Japanese bank in that state, with assets of $8.1 billion last June (down from $10.7 billion at the end of 1990). Fuji Bank comes second, with $5.4 billion-worth. Japanese branches and agencies had $65 billion of assets booked in California alone.
Until now, American bank regulators have not examined these agencies and branches too closely. As wholesale banks, they got their money from their parents or the interbank market; no federally insured retail depositors were involved. Many of their loans were to Japanese borrowers, and were backed by Japanese shares and property thought to be safe. The collapse of asset prices in Japan, and the increasingly visible financial problems of many Japanese companies, have now aroused regulators' interest. In the past three months appraisers have received a flurry of requests from Japanese banks for up-to-date valuations of properties they have financed. The bankers will not like the numbers. The value of Los Angeles office buildings, for example, has fallen by up to one-third since the late 1980s, according to Kenneth Leventhal & Co, a property consultancy in the city.
The risk for the Japanese banks is that American regulators will make them write down loans, and so use up capital that is in desperately short supply at home. American banks, however, will welcome that development. They are fed up with Japanese behaviour in syndicates with problem loans. The Japanese often refuse to foreclose on a property, arguing lamely that they need permission from Japan's finance ministry. They are equally reluctant to get involved in restructurings, and shun solutions like securitisation. They prefer to do nothing, since this avoids having to recognise a loss and use up capital.
Such delay, however, slows the loan-recovery process and hurts all creditors, as property which stands empty in America usually loses its value. That is another reason why the regulators are right to wade in."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224174521/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/50?accountid=14657,"If history is any guide, shares in America's smaller and medium-sized listed companies should be sure bets for investors in 1992. ""Small-cap"" stocks move in a six-to-seven-year cycle, alternately underperforming and outperforming the shares of big companies; they began to beat the bigger ones last year. Small caps also do well in economic recoveries, when interest rates are falling, and in presidential-election years. Their boosters say that everything is going for them in 1992.
Yet when it comes to defining a small-cap, or ""growth"" or ""secondary"", stock, size can be in the eye of the beholder. One man's small cap is another's penny share. For example, one widely followed index of 2,000 companies is compiled by Frank Russell, a firm of asset-management consultants in Washington state. The market value of its smallest component, Colorocs, is $425,000; that of the largest, Gensia Pharmaceutical, is $950.4m.
The Russell 2,000 rose by 44% last year, led by medical and biotechnology stocks. Another measure of smaller-company performance, the Nasdaq Composite Index (which includes 4,100 mainly small and medium-sized companies whose shares are traded over the counter), rose by 56.6%, and the industrial stocks in it by 64.4%. The blue chips' indices, the Dow Jones industrial average and the broader S&P 500, rose 20.3% and 26.3% respectively. This ended a seven-year stretch in which small caps trailed their bigger brethren.
During much of the 1980s, big companies achieved consistently higher profitability than small ones. This changed when growth turned to recession late in 1990. Good small companies can move more swiftly to trim fat than larger ones can. Similarly, when a recession ends, small companies are often able to gear up production more swiftly. Claudia Mott of Prudential Securities, a stockbroking firm, has calculated that the average price of small-cap stocks goes up by 35.7% in the first 12 months of an economic recovery, against a 24.5% gain in the S&P 500.
Sluggish economies outside America are also helping small-cap stocks outperform the blue chips, for large companies depend more heavily on foreign markets than small ones do. One in two large American companies has foreign operations or exports, but only two out of seven small companies do. Overseas business accounts for almost 40% of big companies' profits but contributes barely 30% to those of small companies. Further slowing in Western Europe and Japan will worry big firms more than small ones.
All stocks do well when interest rates are falling, but small-cap shares often do better. On Ms Mott's calculations, the total return on smaller-company stocks during periods of declining interest rates is seven percentage points higher than that on big company shares. Fans of small-cap stocks were encouraged when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate banking committee on January 10th that there was scope for a further percentage-point cut in the discount rate, despite repeated reductions since 1989.
Though small-cap stocks rose in 1991, many fund managers reckon they are still cheaper than large stocks. John Ballen of Massachusetts Financial Services, a fund-management firm, says that the normal price/earnings ratio for small caps usually falls between matching the p/e of the broader market and doubling it. In the early 1980s, when small-company shares were at the relative peak of their previous cycle, they sold on an average p/e that was twice that of bigger shares. Their ratio now is only about one-fifth higher than that of the broad market (though that market is at historically high levels).
The belief that small caps have at last entered an upswing is attracting institutional money, despite the inherently risky nature of such investment. Small companies missed out in the 1980s on the huge flow of institutional dollars into stockmarkets, for several reasons. They were considered too tiny for pension funds and the like to buy in any magnitude without swamping the stock. Markets in them were too illiquid for institutions to be sure they could get out of an investment easily. And many institutional investors were keen on mirroring the big-stock indices; S&P 500 stocks account for 80% of the shares that institutions now own. All that is changing.
Both S&P and Frank Russell have inaugurated indices for the more liquid (though not necessarily largest) smaller stocks, now dubbed ""mid-caps"". These indices are intended as performance benchmarks for institutions that want to index their investments. The American Stock Exchange (Amex) estimates that institutions have so far indexed more than $2 billion in assets to the S&P'S version, the MidCap 400.
The first derivative instruments are starting to appear, making it easier for investors to hedge their risk. The Amex said in early January that it was awaiting final clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to start trading options on the MidCap 400. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange also plans futures and options contracts based on the index.
The new derivatives should encourage a greater flow of institutional money into small caps. So should actively managed mid-cap funds. One of the first was launched by Shawmut National, a New England bank-holding company, earlier this month.
Stirring in investors' minds is the growing hope that smaller shares will perform in the 1990s as they did in the 1970s, 1960s and 1940s, beating not only the broader stockmarket but also long-and short-term government bonds. Political history suggests other relationships, which some will consider grounds for additional optimism. In five out of the past seven presidential election years, small-cap stocks have outperformed big stocks. The two years in which they did not were those in which an incumbent president was returned to office. If small-cap stocks are the sure bet this year that they appear, George Bush cannot be."

After starting life in the first category, Matuschka now finds itself in the third. Once Germany's biggest non-bank financial-services group, it has had to shrink after a series of mishaps. Three-quarters of its 468 staff have left in the past two years, and more may go. But Count Albrecht Matuschka, the firm's boss, says reports that he will leave ""are all bloody lies"".
Founded in Munich in 1970, the Matuschka group specialised in fund management for wealthy clients. It subsequently diversified into venture capital, corporate finance, property and insurance. But after Matuschka's DM104m ($56m) leveraged buy-out in 1988 of a German metal-bashing company, Leifeld, resulted in a DM28m loss, its clients began to question its ambitious strategy. To reassure them, in 1989 Matuschka sold 25% of its Bermuda-based holding company to several investors for an estimated DM45m. They included Japan's Nomura Securities, France's Suez investment-banking group, General Electric Capital of America and an arm of Charterhouse, a British merchant bank.
The investors thought they were buying into a top-flight German firm. Instead, they discovered a group beset by in-fighting and losing staff. In what one shareholder describes as ""a face-saving exercise"", Nomura doubled its stake in Matuschka to 10% in January 1991 and insisted that it put its house in order. At the same time, Count Matuschka raised his stake in the group from 28% to 51% (and later to 66%) by buying out other executives. Then in June 1991 Manfred Meier-Preschany, a former board member of Dresdner Bank, was appointed acting chief executive for six months to turn Matuschka around.
Count Matuschka had hoped to influence this restructuring himself. With the support of the institutional shareholders, however, Mr Meier-Preschany enjoyed complete freedom. He overhauled Matuschka's finances, cut its costs and narrowed it down to two main businesses, asset management and corporate finance; Matuschka now wants to sell or find equity partners for the rest of its operations. The group has eliminated its bank debt, and could make an operating profit of DM6m in 1992, after two years of heavy losses.
At a board meeting on January 8th, Count Matuschka was appointed chief executive of the company, though other shareholders say they will keep him on a tight rein. The count says that he intends to turn Matuschka into ""an old-fashioned banque d'affaires"". As long as it starts making old-fashioned profits again, his fellow shareholders are unlikely to object."

On January 23rd Skandia's chairman is due to meet his counterparts from Norway's UNI Storebrand (UNI) and Denmark's Hafnia. They will try to persuade him that Skandia should join their planned pan-Nordic insurance outfit. If, as they hope, this turns out to include Finland's Pohjola, which already owns 10.5% of Skandia, the group would be one of Europe's six biggest insurers.
It may never be formed, however. Skandia and its suitors have different ideas about co-operation. While Skandia wants to be free to sell insurance anywhere in the Nordic region, UNI wants each partner to stay at home in Scandinavia and to co-operate elsewhere in the world. Bjorn Wohlrath, Skandia's chief executive, has already accused UNI's boss, Jan Erik Langangen, of trying to stiffle competition in Norway, a charge that Mr Langangen rejects.
Skandia's feelings towards Hafnia are hardly warmer. It had hoped to ally itself with Baltica--Denmark's biggest insurer, which Hafnia has tried in vain to take over--but UNI and Hafnia have put paid to that notion, at least for the moment.
In November UNI and Hafnia acquired an option on 23.3% of Skandia's shares from SE-Banken, for SKr4 billion ($675m). SE-Banken had purchased an option to buy 28.2% of Skandia's shares in October 1990, in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to force the insurer into a merger. (The bank is left with 4.9% of Skandia's shares, which it cannot sell before November 23rd 1993 without approval from UNI and Hafnia.) In addition, UNI bought 19.5% of Skandia's shares in the market last autumn. When the SE-Banken transaction is completed in February, UNI will control 28% of Skandia's shares; the Norwegian finance ministry insists that it then sell 3%. Hafnia will have 14.8%, of which it intends to sell 5.8%.
UNI and Hafnia hoped that their stake would help them to gain control of Skandia, then sell off some of its assets. A break-up of the company looks attractive. Jonathan Walker, an analyst at Baring Securities in London, estimates that the value of Skandia's major subsidiaries is more than Skr20 billion. That values the company's shares at SKr262 each, about 50% above their present level.
However, UNI and Hafnia have been foiled by an anti-takeover defence which limits Skandia shareholders to no more than 30 votes apiece. Vesta, Skandia's Norwegian subsidiary, is also a problem. Norway's finance ministry says that if Skandia has not sold Vesta by the end of June, UNI must reduce its stake in the Swedish firm to no more than 10%. Unsurprisingly, Skandia says Vesta is not for sale.
If UNI and Hafnia cannot convince Skandia to co-operate with them soon, they could be in trouble. After failing to find a Finnish buyer (Pohjola seems so far unwilling to increase its holding) for the 8.8% stake that the two together want to sell, Hafnia and UNI have been casting around for another. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), a state-controlled French insurer, has been touted as a possible candidate, but it is reluctant to get embroiled in a hostile bid.
If UNI and Hafnia have to buy the shares themselves, and in a reluctant Skandia, it will increase the financial pressure that they are already under. Hafnia predicts an after-tax loss for 1991, for the second year in a row, and UNI, trapped in troubled Norway, looks weak. UNI's 28% stake in Skandia would equal 152% of its own market capitalisation. Hafnia's 14.8%, together with the 33.7% it owns of Baltica, would amount to 157% of its market value. UNI bought Skandia's shares at an average price of SKr203, Hafnia at an even steeper SKr222. The shares closed on January 15th at SKr173.
Given that Skandia is by far the largest of the three--at the end of 1990 its assets were almost half as big again as those of UNI and Hafnia combined--and that its finances are in better shape, it should be able to shake off its weaker rivals. Skandia's management is gambling that the company's anti-takeover defences will hold up long enough to force UNI and Hafnia to negotiate on its terms. At next week's meeting, this strategy will again be put to the test."

Investors beware: profits will rise as the economy recovers, but not as steeply as the banks suppose.
The TSB group, Britain's sixth-largest bank, set the grim tone for this year's results season. On January 16th it reported a L47m ($80m) pre-tax loss for its financial year to October 1991. Bad-debt provisions of L654m, mainly against loans to small and medium-sized companies, wiped out an operating profit of L607m.
TSB'S loss bodes ill for its bigger brethren. Bad loans--to borrowers as big as Robert Maxwell and as small as the local off-licence--will crush their profits as well. Lehman Brothers, an American investment bank, forecasts a combined bad-debt charge for the four of L5.2 billion. That would leave the banks with pre-tax profits of only L1.2 billion among them, a return on equity of only 7%. Midland, the third-biggest bank, is expected to report a L75m loss.
But bankers and investors alike are betting on a brighter future. The economy will recover, they say, and bad debts will dwindle. Although the growth of banks' basic business, lending, will not regain the furious pace of the 1980s, interest rates, which have been falling since the end of 1990, will continue to widen margins. What is more, say optimists, banks are at last gaining control over their costs. That ""golden scenario"", plus fat dividends paid by those banks that can still afford them, is buoying banks' shares. They are trading at prices 8-1/2-10-1/2 times their expected 1992 earnings, well above their historic average of seven.
The optimists are ignoring a darker possibility, however. In the short run, falling interest rates help banks because their cost of borrowing falls faster than the rates they charge for loans. In the longer term, says John Aitken, an analyst at County NatWest, low interest rates may well wipe out much ofthe benefit from economic recovery.
That is because declining interest rates cut into banks' ""endowment profit"": earnings on interest-free money, including equity capital and non-interest-bearing current accounts. While interest rates were high, endowment profits were vast. Mr Aitken calculates that banks made L46.2 billion deploying this free money between 1980 and 1990; net income earned from deploying interest-bearing deposits was just L38.7 billion. If base rates had averaged 8% in 1990, he reckons, big banks would have lost L260m instead of making a pre-tax profit of L1.9 billion.
If average interest rates drop in the 1990s, so will endowment profits. Income from assets will decline, while the cost of funds declines by less, since a big chunk of them is already free. Each percentage-point drop in interest rates cuts the banks' endowment profit by more than L300m.
Can banks make up the lost profit elsewhere? Not easily. Bankers hope for a drop in bad debts, a rise in fee income and rigorous control of costs. All three will help, but not enough to offset fully a sharp decline in average interest rates. Banks will get a big one-time boost if their bad-debt charges return to normal levels (about 0.7% of loans). The average level of bad debts, however, is unlikely to be lower in the 1990s than in the 1980s; the average endowment yield is.
To close the gap, banks are hammering down costs and drumming up fee income. Lloyds Bank, the smallest of the big four, has cut its staff by 14% from its 1989 peak. Between 1981 and the first half of last year, Lloyds cut costs from 72% of its income to 62%. Lloyds has boosted fee income as well, with the help of an insurance company acquired in 1989. Fees, which made up one-quarter of the bank's income in 1981, contributed two-fifths of income in the first half of last year. Others are squeezing costs and cultivating fee income, though few as successfully as Lloyds.
These worthy efforts will narrow the gap left by a shrinking endowment profit, but perhaps not entirely. Mr Aitken is pessimistic. He points out that banks' real costs have risen sharply over the past decade, and doubts whether their vast spending on cost-saving technology will pay for itself soon. He believes that competition will limit the growth of fee income. Some of his colleagues are more hopeful. They point out that banks are beginning to introduce overdue innovations, like linking an employee's pay rise to his performance. If banks are to escape the endowment trap, they will need many more bright ideas."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139885/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/54?accountid=14657,"Taxing company profits is suddenly a big topic again. On January 8th America's Treasury brought out a hefty study on the subject. The European Community is expected to pronounce on it in February. An OECD report, ""Taxing Profits in a Global Economy"", published on January 16th, shows why the dusty details need attention.
Despite more than a decade of reform, the developed world's corporate tax systems remain badly distorting. Companies are often at a disadvantage in the battle for scarce capital; debt is their most tax-efficient (ie, cheapest) source of finance; inflation produces weird side-effects; and cross-border investment has to be more profitable than domestic to make the same after-tax profit.
The OECD report, prepared with the help of academics including Michael Devereux and Mark Pearson of London's Institute for Fiscal Studies, is the first to examine the taxes that firms in the world's big economies actually pay. International comparisons are tricky because few companies anywhere pay the marginal rates. Governments differ in how they define the tax base and in the depreciation, interest relief and other allowances that they give to companies.
The OECD'S answer is to calculate ""effective tax rates"" in each of its 24 countries: that is, the extra rate of return that a company has to make before tax to offer investors the same return that they can earn on government bonds. The report looks only at quoted manufacturing companies and mostly assumes investors whose own marginal tax rate is zero--most obviously, the tax-exempt financial institutions that invest much of the world's capital.
The gap between marginal and effective rates is striking (see chart 1). (Chart 1 omitted) For an investment in an average OECD firm (one that is financed 35% by debt, 10% by new equity and 55% by retained earnings), the effective tax rate is 15.7%, less than half the marginal rate. The lowest effective rate, 0.8%, is paid in Sweden; the highest, 28.6%, in Turkey. Of the big economies in the Group of Seven (G7), Japan has the highest effective rate, at 23%, and France the lowest, at 7.8%.
For the tax system to be neutral between investing in firms and investing in other assets, the effective rate must be zero. The higher the rate, the more it distorts choices. Assuming the OECD average effective rate of 15.7%, investing in a firm would have to yield 5.9% before tax to match the 5% after-tax return available on bonds.
Tax systems also shape a company's preference for certain sources of capital. Most countries encourage firms to borrow rather than issue equity or use retained earnings. Most, for example, allow a company to deduct interest paid from taxable profits. If an investment is entirely financed by debt, it can get away with earning just 2.8% (using average OECD rates) before tax to show an after-tax return of 5%. An investment financed entirely by retained earnings must earn 7.9% and one by new equity 6.1%.
Again, countries differ. In Germany, if a company borrows for a project, the return on it need be only 0.6% before tax to amount to 5% afterwards; in Ireland it is 4.5%. Germany also favours new equity, which can match bonds with a pre-tax yield of 1.6%; its Japanese equivalent must earn 9%. France taxes new equity more lightly than debt.
In those increasingly rare countries (among them America, unless the Treasury gets its newly revealed way) where dividends are fully taxed twice--first as company profits and then to the shareholder--new equity and retained earnings are treated equally. Where there is full relief from such double taxation, the system is neutral between debt and new equity. Of the bigger economies, for zero-rated taxpayers Germany and Italy are most heavily biased against retained earnings; Japan is skewed in favour of debt.
These calculations are based on the mix of debt, equity and retained earnings through which a notional average OECD company might finance itself. If the sums are done using each country's specific financing mix, effective tax rates fall--proof that tax codes affect investment decisions. Other curiosities arise if the assumed common OECD inflation rate of 4.5% is replaced by rates in individual countries. The higher inflation soars, the more the tax bias towards debt distorts the choice of financing.
As more companies looked across national borders in the 1980s, double taxation by home and host countries of company profits earned abroad emerged as a real barrier. So did withholding taxes on profits paid to foreign investors, and denying to non-residents tax breaks granted to domestic investors. Perhaps the most original contribution of the OECD report is to show just how big a barrier to cross-border investment tax can be. On broadly plausible assumptions about financing mixes, firms everywhere face lower taxes on domestic profits than on foreign ones (see chart 2). (Chart 2 omitted)
The average pre-tax return needed at home to match the 5% post-tax bond yield is 5.9%; the same investment overseas must yield 7.5% before tax. This gap is smallest in Australia, and biggest in Portugal. Of the big countries, France, Britain, Canada and America discourage their firms from investing abroad the least; Japan, Germany and especially Italy do so the most. Germany, Britain and Italy are relatively attractive to investors from outside, whereas Canada, France and Japan are less so. Weighting for actual investment flows--rather than assuming that all countries invest equally in each other--cuts the distortions a bit. A network of bilateral tax treaties has reduced problems of overlapping jurisdictions.
Inflation, and how tax systems cope with it, also affect investment decisions. High inflation tends to make a country a good place to invest from (the tax-relieved cost of debt-financing falls) but a poor place to invest into (so does the value of, eg, depreciation). It has recently been more attractive to invest out of Britain and Canada than into them. The reverse is true of Japan.
All this might make one think that tax is the determining factor behind investment decisions. If it were, companies would be even more debt-laden than they are. Yet retained earnings are in fact companies' main source of financing; debt is usually regarded as relatively risky, and having a lot often depresses a firm's share price. Taxes do matter, however, and more than before. As capital becomes more mobile, both within and between countries, what once seemed fine print is emerging in ever bolder relief."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224164646/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/55?accountid=14657,"Short cuts look tempting. However, there is often a price to be paid for leaving the straight and narrow--or, in the case of the human genome project, the long and coiled. The attempt to record the details of every turn of DNA in the human body always promised to be a hard slog. The organisers of the genome project talk of needing 12-15 years and $3 billion; they justify such efforts with promises of new drugs, new diagnostic techniques and even new genes for old. Governments around the world have heard the promises and decided to join in, giving the programme a warm glow of international co-operation. A new short cut, though, provides an easier way to get at many of the promised goodies; the glow is fading, and some of the grander scientific aims may find themselves ignored.
The size of the project reflects the fact that it is about the genome, not just the genes. The genome is the sum of all the genetic information passed down from one generation to the next, as a message that is 3 billion letters long and written in DNA. The genes are the passages in this message which give descriptions of the molecules of life, almost all of which are proteins. There maybe as many as 100,000 genes, but even that number would add up to only a tenth of the total length, and probably less. The rest is referred to as ""junk"", though it is still of interest to some biologists. The junk may have a hidden purpose. Some of it probably regulates the way the genes are made use of. Even if it is useless, fascinating details about human evolution must be waiting within it in the form of cast-off genes.
The genome programme aims to decipher the whole thing, junk and all. Its first stage is meant to concentrate on finding out where the genes lie--""mapping"" their positions in the genome. Craig Venter, of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, in Maryland, is taking a different approach. A few months ago he announced that his research group had worked out part of the structure of several hundred genes, and that nearly all of the genes in the genome could probably be found and sequenced in four or five years for $10m. His colleagues looked up from their benches. He also announced, though it was not much noticed at the time, that he and his bosses were applying for patents on 337 of the genes so far discovered. But this was noticed by James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA and a leading light of the American genome project. Dr Watson inveighed against the idea at a congressional briefing, and the test tubes began to fly.
The secret of Dr Venter's success is an open one--complement DNA technology (cDNA). It uses the time-honoured espionage technique of mugging the messenger. Genes are stored in the nucleus of the cell. The proteins they describe are made some distance away, in assembly plants called ribosomes. This arrangement requires a courier to shuttle out of the nucleus with a copy of the genetic instructions, so that the ribosomes know what to make. The courier, called messenger RNA, is a chemical like DNA but shorter and simpler, with a single twisted strand rather than a double helix.
Dr Venter first turns cells from brain tissue into mush and extracts the messenger RNA from them. Then he uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to turn the RNA transcripts back into DNA. Lastly, the DNA is copied many times, until there is enough for chemical analysis.
Cells make lots of proteins at once (brain cells are reckoned to be making 30,000 at any one time, which is partly why Dr Venter chose them), so there are many different messenger RNAs in the mush. That means many different genes can be caught at once. And the selection of genes that is found is far from random. Every cell nucleus in the body--except those in sperm and eggs--contains the whole genome. But any given cell uses only a fraction of the genes at any one time, and cDNA captures only the genes being used. So the genes Dr Venter gets from a sample of brain tissue using cDNA will all be genes describing proteins that are particularly useful in brain tissue. That maybe a valuable clue to the function of the proteins. Comparing cDNA from different tissues will show which genes are used in all cells and which are reserved for a few specialised ones.
So cDNA scores over the old techniques in two ways. It ignores junk. And it tells you which genes are active in specific tissues. Useful stuff. But just how useful? The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the parent body of Dr Venter's institution, is paying a lot of attention to that question. The success of its patent applications for Dr Venter's work depends upon it.
Patenting human genes is not unprecedented. There is, for instance, a patent--hotly contested last year--on the DNA of erythropoietin, a chemical which tells the body to make new blood cells. So it is conceivable that the NIH will be granted patents on the genes. But this will happen only if it can prove the utility, novelty and nonobviousness of its claim.
Novelty, on the whole, Dr Venter has. The genes he is attempting to patent are those from his trawl which have not shown up on searches of public gene databases. Some may have already been discovered by other people and not yet reported, but most will be new. Utility is more tricky. As used by Dr Venter, the cDNA technique does not produce a sequence for the whole gene. To speed things up, only a portion of the cDNA gene is actually sequenced, a ""tag"" that will allow the gene to be recognised at a later date. It is difficult to argue for the utility of something which has been incompletely identified and the function of which is unknown. There is an argument, though, that a tag might be turned into a chemical probe to help locate the gene on a chromosome, which does confer some utility.
Non-obviousness is a problem, too. Dr Venter is not the only person who has thought of using cDNA to go on fishing expeditions. Tony Vickers, of the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Britain, heads a project which has partially sequenced about 2,000 genes from a variety of tissues. Jacques Hanoune, of INSERM in France, is working on muscle, and Kenichi Matsubara of Osaka University in Japan is developing an automatic system to look at cDNA from liver. So Dr Venter does not have a unique insight. He has, however, sent these other institutions running for cover.
The MRC has not applied for patents. Before the NIH filed, the British body was advised by its lawyers that such an application would be unlikely to succeed. Instead it proposes to allow free access to its gene-sequence database for those (mainly academics) who would reciprocate with their results. Others (mainly industrialists) who wished to take without giving would be charged L5,000 ($9,000) for the privilege. Whether this will work has yet to be discovered. Since Dr Venter filed in America, the MRC has been keeping its cDNA sequences to itself, away from the eyes of dons and capitalists alike. The memory of monoclonal antibodies, developed by the MRC, not patented, and now the foundation of a multimillion-dollar industry, still rankles.
While the lawyers scratch their heads, some, such as Sir Walter Bodmer, the president of HUGO, an umbrella organisation that tries to oversee genome work worldwide, fear research will be held up. There is some truth in this. The MRC sequences are certainly out of bounds for the moment. But Dr Venter's are not. His initial results--the sequences of his tags--were published at the same time as his application. He intends to do the same with his next tranche of data. Once a patent is applied for, secrecy is no longer necessary, and neither Dr Venter nor the NIH has any interest in slowing down the pace of academic research.
There are other worries. The idea of patenting genes by the tonne (or rather, given their size, by the microgram) without the least idea of what they do sounds rum to many. Among other things, there is the reasonable fear that broad-brush patents issued so early in the process will inhibit commercial research. Companies that feel they cannot properly protect their innovations because of such patents may decline the opportunity to innovate.
Another worry is more theoretical. Once in full swing, a laboratory could probably churn out 2,000 cDNA gene sequences a month. At that rate, a small number of cooperating laboratories could do the lot in a couple of years. In competition they might take a little longer. If cDNA delivers the goods that quickly and cheaply--all or most of a person's genes in full working order and with the tissues they are active in known--what happens to the rest of the human genome project? The mapping part will be easy once the genes are sequenced. And $3 billion will suddenly look like a high price to pay for sequences which even the boffins call junk. The non-gene parts of the genome intrigue some scientists (not all of them), but they hold little charm for politicians and drug companies. So there is a chance that the junk may find itself junked."

But flew types of car lighting could make driving safer, and change the shape and styling of future cars. Perhaps the brightest of these new ideas is to fit cars with black lights.
The most noticeable change will take place next year in France, where it will no longer be compulsory for French cars to have yellow headlamps. France's yellow headlights were introduced in 1936, not for safety reasons but merely to distinguish French vehicles from German ones. Although many French drivers reckon their yellow lights dazzle less, Peugot, a French car maker, thinks that white ones produce 20-30% more light, and wants its drivers to get the benefits that come with this extra illumination.
To ensure that powerful headlights do not dazzle oncoming drivers, car makers are now using computer-aided design to produce headlight lenses and reflectors with complex surface-shapes. Instead of employing a simple reflector and then blocking off part of the light to form a dipped beam, these new lenses and reflectors can focus all the available light from a headlamp more precisely on the road ahead. The lights can also be made smaller and narrower. That will allow designers to dream up sleeker and more aerodynamic vehicles.
Germany's BMW has one further and become the first car maker to fit electric discharge lamps to some cars. Instead of using a bulb with a metal filament, discharge lamps produce light by passing electricity through a gas enclosed in a tube (in this case, xenon). BMW's discharge lamps are three times more powerful than a conventional headlight and spread their light more uniformly. But to ensure the lights do not dazzle, the company fits them only to cars with self-levelling suspension, which can keep the beams firmly fixed on the road ahead.
In the eternal night of its underground test road, buried beneath its R&D centre in Munich, BMW is also experimenting with ultraviolet (UV) headlamps. UV is not visible to the human eye--which is why it is sometimes called ""black"" light. But when UV radiation falls on certain surfaces they fluoresce and emit visible light, rather like white shirts in discos. Road signs coated with fluorescent material leap out of the darkness when caught in the invisible glare of UV headlights.
Sweden's Volvo, which makes cars that drive around with their lights on all the time, is also testing UV lamps. It reckons that, provided the lamps prove safe for use in cars (too much UV radiation can damage eyesight), the main difficulty will be the willingness of governments to paint signs and road markings in fluorescent materials. At least they will not have to bother about some road hazards that Volvo drivers may be concerned with. The European elk (moose to Americans) is a particularly hazardous animal to hit in a car, because its high centre of gravity ensures that the body strikes the windscreen. But though its shape makes it particularly worrying its pelt may offer a solution. Volvo says that elk fur fluoresces naturally in UV light."

They are evenly spread across the sky. They are never seen in the same place twice. You now know almost as much as anyone does about gamma-ray bursts. They were first observed in the 1960s, when spy satellites looking for the gamma rays given off by nuclear explosions picked up unexpected bursts of gamma rays. After a brief panic, the people running the satellites concluded that the gamma rays came from outer space, not an earthly adversary's tests. And after almost three decades of observation, no one knows a lot more than they did when it was first decided that the heavens, not the Chinese, were responsible.
There are, of course, theories. The most popular blame the disturbances on neutron stars, small objects with incredibly powerful magnetic and gravitational fields. A sharp movement of the star's crust--a ""starquake""--or the impact of a comet might well trigger a burst of gamma rays. However, evidence from the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), an American satellite launched last year, seems to bring those theories into doubt.
One of the instruments on GRO is designed to pick up gamma-ray bursts. In last week's Nature some of its early results were reported. Since neutron stars are born of normal stars, they might be expected in the same areas of the sky as their progenitors--in the heart and arms of the galaxy. The 153 bursts studied, though, showed no preference for those regions. They were spread at random over the sky, as though they had nothing to do with the galaxy at all.
Perhaps, then, they come from outside the galaxy. If so, a far brighter source is necessary. Bohdan Paczynski of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton has been working on such an idea for years. He thinks that the gamma-ray bursts mark the most spectacular events imaginable, in which neutron stars are not perpetrators but victims, eaten up whole by the only things in the universe with even stronger gravitational fields--black holes.
Collisions between a neutron star and a black hole are not likely to be common. Dr Paczynski reckons that there might be one in a typical galaxy every 1m years. So, as GRO sees a burst more or less every day, it must be seeing bursts at tremendous distances. It may be that almost every such event in the visible universe is being monitored by the satellite's detectors.
Dr Paczynski admits that he cannot explain quite why gamma-ray bursts look the way they do. If their extra-galactic origin becomes accepted, though, he expects that lots of other people will start to think about the problem, and that at least one of them will be able to turn it into something plausible--testimony to the faith astrophysicists have in their ability to tell good stories about the universe. The provenance of the bursts may soon be settled. If the gamma rays come from truly huge distances, they will be ""red-shifted"" because of the expansion of the universe; the bursts will thus be stretched out to last longer. If that is so, the fainter bursts should be characteristically distorted. Further analysis of the data to hand, or the data that will be to hand soon, should show such an effect.
If the bursts are not that far off, then the ideas about neutron stars closer to home could be revamped. The neutron stars may sit in a spherical shell around the galaxy. For the distribution of bursts in such a shell to appear uniform from the earth, as it does, the radius of the shell would have to be much larger than the distance from the earth to the galactic core. If the neutron stars are bound in such a halo, the galaxy must be far bigger and heavier than it appears; there must be more to it than stars alone. So the glimmerings of gamma rays, maybe a clue to another great mystery--the ""dark matter"" in the universe, perceived only through the effects of its gravity, that quietly shapes the brightness visible to astronomers to its own mysterious ends."

What those show, in detail, is how Kennedy and his top aides, increasingly vexed and frustrated, struggled with a steadily deteriorating political and military situation. Despite its optimistic pronouncements, the administration was often both poorly informed and drifting. The dispatch of the Green Berets as a counter-insurgency force was largely a public-relations exercise.
America's problems reached a climax on November 1st 1963 when its protege in South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, was overthrown and murdered by the South Vietnamese army. This shocked Kennedy, yet five days later he wrote to Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge in Saigon that ""Your own leadership in pulling together and directing the whole American operation in South Vietnam in recent months has been of greatest importance, and you should know that this achievement is recognised here throughout the government.""
All through that difficult year, there is no evidence whatever of an ""independent"" CIA policy, at odds with the president's, that might have served as the basis for an assassination conspiracy. Both before and after the coup, the president had no discernible plans for a substantial withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, then estimated at about 16,000. To be sure, on October 11th 1963 he signed a memorandum declaring that ""no formal announcement should be made of the implementation of plans to withdraw 1,000 US military personnel by the end of 1963."" But that, as the record shows, was as far as the president was prepared to go.
If Kennedy was in the process of changing his mind about Vietnam, the State Department volumes contain no indication of it. On the contrary, on October 23rd, for instance, he sent this message to Diem on the occasion of the National Holiday of Vietnam:
I wish once again to express the admiration of the American people for the unfailing courage of the South Vietnamese people in their valiant struggle against the continuing efforts of communism to undermine and destroy Vietnamese independence. The United States of America has confidence in the future of the Republic of Vietnam, in its ability both to overcome the present communist threat to their independence, and to determine their own destiny.
After the anti-Diem coup, James Reston and the New York Times continued to press for negotiations with North Vietnam that would lead to the unification and neutralisation of the whole country. In public and private, senior State and White House officials rejected such suggestions, basing themselves specifically on the president's own words.
Foreign critics of America's policy received the same treatment. On November 5th, Charles Bohlen, the American ambassador in Paris, told a hostile President De Gaulle ""that we would have been perfectly willing to live with a divided Vietnam but that the communists were the ones who had started the current war and that it was either a question of helping Vietnam resist these attacks or letting the entire country go communist."" De Gaulle was unpersuaded.
On November 13th Michael Forrestal, then a senior member of the National Security Council staff, gave the same line to the New York Times, which had not ceased to run nettlesome news stories and editorial comments. Forrestal told Robert Kleiman that, ""it would be folly...at the present time"" to pursue ""a negotiated settlement...between North and South Vietnam"". Responsible South Vietnamese ""would view the prospects of a new Geneva Conference as...a complete sell-out by the US."" ""I referred"", Forrestal concluded, ""to the president's statements indicating that the US was prepared to withdraw its presence from South Vietnam as soon as Hanoi ceased its interference in the South or as soon as the South was able to handle the problem on its own.""
The following day Kennedy himself restated American policy at a White House press conference:
Now, that is our object, to bring Americans home, permit the South Vietnamese to maintain themselves as a free and independent country, and permit democratic forces within the country to operate--which they can, of course, much more freely when the assault from the inside, and which is manipulated from the north, is ended.
A few days later, Kennedy embarked on his fatal trip to Dallas. And Vietnam became Lyndon Johnson's war."

A craftsman-journalist in the best American tradition, Axel Krause has amassed thousands of interviews in 30 years in Europe, hoarding them like skeins of thread that might one day be worked into a grand tapestry. The result is a survey of the development of the European Community that sweeps from Charlemagne to the eve of its recent summit in Maastricht.
Image piles upon image. When you put this book down, you will have marched into diplomatic action with EC zealots, lobbied with its lobbyists, jeered with its doubters, oohed at Margaret Thatcher's attack on the Community at Bruges, aahed at the speech of Jacques Delors that provoked her, met the mafia gearing up for the great 1992 market, and schemed with American and Japanese leaders about how best to cope with the whole phenomenon. You will know the new Western Europe as never before. But you will be hard put to understand it.
Mr Krause, who had to flee Hitler's Europe as a boy, is an American with a direct feel for what drove the Community's founders. He understands that Europe is a cause to be fought for and an image to be built. A nice vignette shows Jacques Delors in 1989, determined not to go to Washington unless received there by President Bush with the full pomp due to a head of state, which he is not. Mr Bush neatly sidesteps this protocol minefield. He casually tells an off-guard Mr Delors that he is looking forward to having him for lunch at the White House on June 15th, so ""see you in Washington in the middle of next month.""
In one big respect, Mr Krause's enthusiasm for the cause goes overboard. His opening interview is with a young Dutch engineer at Philips, an electronics company struggling to match Japanese competitors in making television sets. Describing how tough it will be to succeed, the man says that ""what we desperately need is European leadership."" Mr Krause is impressed by this. He thinks Europe's industrial malaise is so deep that it will take more than mere management strategy to end it.
The long trauma of Philips is woven through the book as one Euro-visionary chief executive succeeds another. Cornelius van der Klugt tells Mr Krause openly that what he expects from Europe's leaders is public money and protection. Today things are looking up at Philips, not because of such succour, but because the company has been forced to shape up--in other words because of management strategy. Mr Krause does not mention this.
His book is imbued with the idea that trade is warfare by other means. When British advertising agencies plant their flag on Madison Avenue, this symbolises new European dynamism. When the Japanese invest heavily in European manufacturing, this symbolises Europe in peril. Mr Krause provides much evidence that big business is irredeemably government-ridden--his tales of Airbus, Spanish supertrains, and AT&T's investments in Europe are eye-opening. But it becomes cumulatively frustrating that such an experienced business journalist will not draw conclusions from his own tales.
Is it only a paradox that Sumitomo from Japan has done wonders for a grimy tyre factory that it bought in France? What sadly became of that great British expeditionary force to Madison Avenue? Didn't the senior commission figure who called Carlo de Benedetti's ill-fated bid for Societe Generale de Belgique ""a day for Europe"" make a mug of himself? What is Mr Krause's honest verdict on ""Eureka""--the research programme that was launched as Europe's answer to star wars?
As Southey wrote of the other, real, sort of warfare:
""But what good came of it at last?"" Quoth little Peterkin. ""Why that I cannnot tell,"" said he, ""But 'twas a famous victory."""

In his foreword to this book, Vaclav Havel says Aung San Suu Kyi is an example of the power of the powerless. It is a nice phrase, but not wholly true. Miss Suu Kyi is not like the dissidents, Mr Havel among them, who persistently irritated the masters of the former Soviet empire but were not considered a real threat to them. She has actual power, and is feared by the soldiers who run Myanmar, the name they have given to Burma. She is the legally elected ruler of the country. Her party won overwhelmingly in the 1990 general election that the soldiers, to their subsequent regret, allowed to take place and the results of which they have refused to honour.
In December the junta claimed that Miss Suu Kyi had been expelled from her party. Few Burmese accept this, and assume it is another sign of the junta's nervousness. Miss Suu Kyi's presence in Myanmar is a nagging reminder that democracy's time will come again, even in a country where it has been suppressed since 1962. Some in the regime, for whom the gun is the solution for difficult problems, would like to kill her. But Miss Suu Kyi is a soldier's daughter, which gives her a special status. And the protection the outside world seeks to provide her with, such as the award of the Nobel peace prize, is not without value. So the regime pleads with her to leave the country. Surely you would like to see your husband again, at Harvard?
Miss Suu Kyi declines, even though she is confined to her house. She does not want to become just another political exile. That would be very ordinary, and she is far from that. One of the most interesting essays in her book is an honest account of her father, Aung San. When the second world war broke out in Europe, Aung San, a politician with a following among students, was wooed by the Japanese. When Japan invaded Burma in 1941, he was a general in an ""independence army"" that marched ""with great pride and joy"" alongside the Japanese troops. In 1943 he was decorated by the Japanese emperor in Tokyo. In 1945, when it was clear that the Japanese were going to lose, he sided with the British. In 1947, when Burma was close to independence and Aung San was on its Executive Council, he was assassinated.
Not perhaps a conventional hero in western eyes. Miss Suu Kyi, too, is more subtle than she seems. A good reason for reading this book is to try to understand the woman who is likely, eventually, to run this beautiful, benighted country."

That was not a problem for his printer. But the fact that he decided to add an extra 9,380 words certainly was. Joyce seemed determined to increase the confusion which has surrounded his texts. He once joked that his books would ""keep the professors busy for centuries"".
One such professor, John Kidd of Boston University, is being paid $100,000 by the university to edit the text of ""Ulysses""; he is also on a $300,000 contract with Norton for a seven-volume edition of Joyce's works. Mr Kidd has emerged as the leading scholar of Joycean texts, having conducted a campaign for some years against his main rival, Hans Walter Gabler of Munich.
Mr Gabler, with the help of ten researchers, produced what was regarded as the definitive text in 1984. It was hailed as a massive achievement, not least by Anthony Burgess. Mr Gabler claimed that he had made no fewer than 5,000 improvements to the text, and was confident that it was far superior to the original 1922 edition or to the Bodley Head edition of 1961. But six years later, after a barrage of criticism from the Kidd camp that ran at length in the New York Review of Books and The Times Literary Supplement, the Gabler text is under such a cloud that Penguin has decided to revert to the 1961 Bodley Head edition for the relaunch of Joyce's works this year.
Each phase of the controversy is laden with financial irony. On January 2nd 1992, when Joyce had been dead for more than 50 years, his works emerged from copyright. This year Minerva, Oxford University Press, Lilliput (Kidd version), Macmillan and others will join Penguin in reissuing various texts. It is ironic that so much cash is to be made from the works of a man who starved for days as a student because of his ""inanition"", and who was unable to afford even basic care for his weak eyes through much of his early career.
Joyce would take the ironies in his stride. He did, afterall, succeed in convincing Harriet Shaw Weaver, a rich admirer, to bestow upon him the equivalent of over $1.8m in today's money so that he could continue with his work. He spent the money with a reckless disregard befitting one of the century's finest novelists, living the life of a carping aesthete in Zurich and Trieste.
Perhaps because of his early poverty, Joyce never missed a chance to scrounge money. Occasionally he would copy out a fragment from a manuscript he was working on and sell it to a wealthy benefactor. But this has merely added to the confusion about which was the definitive text. Was it the version he sold to ""The Egoist""? Or was it the very different version he sent to his French typesetters in Dijon? His sloping, barely decipherable handwriting and the enormous problems with his eyesight did not help either.
The lurid content of some of the work has added to the difficulties facing scholars. At one stage Joyce's works were being typed for him by a woman who worked in the British embassy in Paris. Her husband, on reading some of the steamier passages from the Circe chapter of ""Ulysses"", was so incensed that he threw sections of the manuscript into the fire, denying generations of scholars an opportunity to engage in even more vicious debate.
It is the attempt to fuse together the various versions of the same texts which has caused the biggest problems. Mr Kidd's masterwork is eagerly awaited not just by a new generation of students but by dozens of textual scholars who are preparing to ambush him in the undergrowth. Aware of the heroic nature of those who claim to have produced the ""definitive text"", Penguin is to revert to a 30-year-old version which will carry introductions written by a legion of Irish scholars. These, at least, may have a better understanding of Joyce's minute local references and drifting Dublin speech rhythms than an American or a German.
Mr Kidd is on record as stating that the Bodley Head text is the most satisfactory to date. This sensible remark will not prevent Penguin from coming under fire for its decision to shirk the gigantic task of re-editing the writings of Shem the Penman, but readers should be grateful it has refrained."

Twentieth-century poetry bothers people: difficult, elusive, toneless, with too many strange meanings packed into too few words. This book, an anthology of younger voices that have risen to prominence in Britain within the past ten years, stresses that poetry at its best can also be rooted in song, music and dance, and is not necessarily a subject that has to be studied at universities.
The strongest and most refreshing breezes of the past decade have come from the West Indies and such poets as John Agard, a Guyanese. Mr Agard's work can be summed up in a line from one of his own poems: ""Mugging de Queen's English/is the story of my life."" These are humorous poems of displacement--the colonised outsider coming in and reflecting upon the curious habits of the colonial master, as in ""Finders Keepers"" (see box). Mr Agard is essentially a performance poet whose marvellous vocal rang and long, weaving fingers can make the actions of an English cricketer seem as grotesque and peculiar as the behaviour of any other primitive tribe.
FINDERS KEEPERS
This morning on the way to Charing Cross I found a stiff upper lip lying there on the train seat
Finders Keepers I was tempted to scream
But something about that stiff upper lip left me speechless
It looked so abandoned so unloved like a frozen glove nobody bothers to pick up
I could not bear to hand in that stiff upper lip to the Lost & Found
So I made a place for it in the lining of my coat pocket
And I said Come with me to the Third World
You go thaw off
Most of all, the West Indian poems in this anthology re-emphasise the link between poetry and its bodily expression in sound and movement; and this means that the collection, unlike most anthologies, opens its doors to song lyrics, photographs, graphics, poems expressed in cartoon form--in fact, any means by which poems can be taken to a wider audience.
The strongest representative of native Britons in this book is Carol Ann Duffy, who casts a harsh, unsparing eye on the values of the 1980s. The headlong pursuit of money, for example, is summed up in her chilly litany of synonyms: ""Turnover. Profit. Readies. Cash. Loot. Dough. Income. Stash. Dosh. Bread. Finance. Brass..."" In another poem, a bibulous, sentimental tabloid-headline writer dreams of that great day when the young will learn his headlines by heart, immortalising him in his own meretricious rubbish: ""Stuff 'em! Gotcha! The instant tits and bottom line of art.""
The chief fault of this book is that it is imbued with a kind of misty-eyed Blakean confidence that poetry has the power to bring about a state of harmony between nations, to heal the division of the sexes, to usher in a condition of universal love; and, like all such dreams of this kind, the editor's vision walks hand in hand with a ferocious capacity to denounce anything that seems to be avoiding the light of Blake's countenance. This is a radical, subversive document, full of concern for the exploited, the unemployed, the animals of the world; yet it has no time at all for the kind of poetry with which it does not agree, the mean-spirited, ""academic"" kind, for example, that seems to be more intent on playing James with language than changing the world.
Yet poetry, like the Labour Party, is a broad church, with good and bad on all sides. Many of these examples may seem thin without the clamour of verbal and musical accompaniment. And the fact that some writer has been out of work for six months does not make him uniquely qualified to memorialise his pain in a work of art subsidised by the Arts Council."
11-Jan-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224164592/fulltext/7A82C8AC4C6746DFPQ/63?accountid=14657,"The production notes handed out by Disney for its latest film, ""Beauty and The Beast"" (out in America, released in Europe in October), contain the remarkable statement that this is only the fifth film the company has made of a classic fairy tale. The first was ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" in 1937. Disney's point is to put reviewers on notice that they are about to see a film in the elite company of ""Snow White"", ""Cinderella"", ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""The Little Mermaid"". Can it stand the comparison?
In some ways, it can. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is full of breathtaking art work, entertaining characters and a good dollop of harmless morality along the lines of not judging a book by its cover. That morality, for once, was not imported by Disney; it is there in the original story. To save her father, Belle, a beautiful girl living in a French village, moves into an enchanted castle wherein resides a beast. The beast, a handsome prince under a spell, will die unless he loves and is loved by the time he reaches 21.
Gradually, the girl overcomes her disgust and learns to see humanity in the beast, at which point he sheds his ugliness. The story is a gift to sentimental Freudians, and has never been better done than by Jean Cocteau (slightly influenced by Disney) in ""La Belle et la Bete"" in 1946.
Disney's story differs in at least two ways from previous versions. The first is pure Disney: not only the castle is enchanted, but everything in it. Thus the cook, the voice of Angela Lansbury, is a teapot. Her son Chip is a cup (chipped, of course). The castle is run by Lumiere, a candelabra with a passing resemblance to Yves Montand by way of Maurice Chevalier, and Cogsworth, a rather fussy clock. While Belle and the beast dance towards their happy conclusion, these characters weave their magic, including a Busby Berkeley dining sequence complete with spoons diving into soup.
The second difference is that ""Beauty"" has been accompanied by some exceedingly clever marketing, aimed as much at adults as at children. In New York the film opened at an upmarket Manhattan cinema instead of the mall theatres where children go. One series of posters emphasises the romance of the plot (at least one reviewer has recommended the film as a ""date movie""); another gives Belle a most un-Disneylike cleavage. Disney's growing number of mall stores are piled with ""Beauty"" goods. Even Chip's chip has been removed in the replica available in shops, presumably to make sure that no one is put off a purchase.
Unlike past Disney heroines (up to the feisty Little Mermaid, at least), Belle is an intelligent, independent woman. No husband-seeker this, she reads books; dreams of travel and pines for something more worthwhile than the provincial life she has. To the disbelief of most townsfolk, she rejects the advances of the handsome Gaston, a splendid Schwarzeneggeresque scene-stealer. In traditional fantasyland a woman like Belle would swoon in Gaston's presence, not dismiss him as a yahoo.
With such characterisations, Disney may indeed have pulled off its greatest achievement: political correctness without the shrillness that, in 1990s America, usually accompanies it. For the next test, how about ""Uncle Tom's Cabin""?"

Nevertheless, he pulled himself together and did what any good Caroline husband might have done in the circumstances: he called for a portrait painter. Two days later, Sir Anthony Van Dyck (no less) was busy sketching Lady Venetia's corpse, propped up in bed and wearing pearls and pouting lips, a femme fatale in more senses than one. That done, Sir Kenelm arranged to have his wife's hands ""cast in Playster, and her feet and Face"" and, presumably not before time, allowed her to be buried.
Lady Venetia's last portrait is among the cheerier exhibits in the Victoria & Albert Museum's new show, ""The Art of Death"" (running until 22nd March). As if January in London were not sufficiently depressing, death seems to be enjoying something of a vogue in the capital. The Museum of Mankind is celebrating the Mexican death ritual, while cinemas showing the cadaverous ""Addams Family"" are playing to packed houses. But true connoisseurs of the morbid will find the V&A's collection of artefacts associated with the English death ritual from 1500-1800 lugubrious beyond compare.
This, it must be said, was not the museum's intended reaction to the show. The aim seems to have been to suggest that Sir Kenelm's response to his wife's demise was, in some way, a more wholesome one than his typical modern counterpart's would be. ""Our ancestors recognised death as a universal human experience"", sniffs the V&A's advertisement for ""The Art of Death"" (adding, chillingly, that ""visitors will be encouraged to explore the various stages of the death ritual"").
Among other mementi mori on display are a 17th-century hair-slide decorated with symbols of the charnel-house: a reminder, presumably, of the vanity of vanity. The well-dressed Renaissance woman could accessorise with a watch in the shape of a skull, or a locket like the so-called Tor Abbey jewel, an innocent-looking item that opens to reveal a miniature skeleton.
Nor did the connection between death and other forms of enjoyment go unnoticed. Dessert spoons decorated with skulls must have made it easier to turn down second helping in the 18th century, while biscuits shrouded in black-bordered mourning wrappers cannot have had many takers. Snuff-users trying to kick the habit could avail themselves of coffin-shaped snuff boxes, doubtless leading to ribald variations on the phrase ""to snuff it"". If all this drove the owner of the Selby Cup to drink, he would have found the legend ""Remember the end/Repent and amend"" waiting for him at the bottom of the bowl. At this point in the exhibition certain critics, free wine in hand, grew pale and turned away.
All this may be fair enough, but what of the poor cricketer in Richard Dagley's 1827 engraving? There he stands at the wicket, quavering, while a skeleton prepares to bowl him a googly. The first response of the viewer is that this is too much; surely cricket is a healthy outdoor pursuit, a manly game, with no possible risk attached? The eye then wanders to the cricketer's unprotected head, the mind to the latest variety of West Indian fast bowling, and intimations of mortality are not so far behind."

In 1992 one candidate pursuing the Democratic nomination introduces his 15-page, point-by-point plan for the next four years with the words: ""In these pages, I spell out in plain language what I intend to do as president.""
Chalk up one triumph for democracy. A century and a half of political presidencies have changed the tone of candidates for the better. At least they now tell the people what they plan to do--before they are elected. Already 1992 is being called the year of substance. The Democratic candidates are competing to make their policy statements heavy and comprehensive. Here's the beef, at last.
Well, not quite. Year of substance? When the big issues so far have been Gennifer Flowers and the president's syntax gap? Open one of the candidates' policy tomes at random and you will find such platitudes as, ""We need to pursue a five-part long-term strategy: 1. Empower every American to be more productive by changing the ways we educate our children and train every worker. 2. Lead a revolution in government so it becomes an engine of opportunity again, not an obstacle to it...""; and so on. If these are specific promises, a candidate would do better to reprint the Sermon on the Mount and call it ""America's challenge for the new millennium"".
VOTE FOR ME AND I'LL STAND FOR WHAT YOU WANT
On February 18th, with the New Hampshire primary, America begins its peculiar national gestation: nine months of trivia, razzmatazz, flattery and vitriol, at the end of which one man (no woman, this time) will be saddled with the hopes and aspirations of the nation (see page 26). To the foreign observer, the election will have little to do with policy, much to do with muck-raking and bombast, and will be settled by one or two incomprehensible incidents involving gaffes, television commercials and flags. Some Americans, too, will be lamenting the subversion of democracy by hidden persuaders from Madison Avenue, the narcissistic eye of television and the shameless expediency of the candidates. They will be nostalgic for a golden age of learned debates between men of stature.
In fact that golden age never existed, and the public has only a minor interest in sticking to the ""issues"". The voters are not just choosing a set of policy promises; they are judging a man's record and predicting whether he would be calm in a crisis, capable of overcoming bureaucratic inertia, good at selecting subordinates and able to handle criticism. In reaching their verdict, they are also interested in knowing what skeletons are in his cupboard.
As for the candidate, he knows he cannot avoid some policy promises. It will be hard to run for the Republican nomination without opposing abortion, or for the Democratic nomination without opposing oil drilling off California's coast. It will help also to promise such things as prosperity, peace and getting tough with the Japanese over their imports. And it will be necessary to stamp himself as a man broadly of the right, or left. Beyond that, the candidate knows that the more specific he gets the more trouble he is in. If George Bush had stuck to his policy promises of 1988--maintaining defence spending, not negotiating with the Russians, not raising taxes, and so forth--he would be in even worse political shape than he now is. His greatest challenges have been to react to events that could not have been forecast four years ago: the fall of the Berlin Wall, Tiananmen Square, the invasion of Kuwait, the Moscow putsch, the recession.
In 1988 the way to judge how Mr Bush would react to the challenges ahead was to examine his record and his character. He and his advisers knew this. Even something as unambiguous as ""Read my lips: no new taxes"" was as much about character as about policy. It was a none-too-subtle attempt to sound like a Clint Eastwood character, ready for anything.
It is quite right to want to judge the character of a man who might occupy the Oval Office. But what constitutes character? Among the character flaws that have brought down or damaged presidential candidates are weeping, plagiarism, adultery, sweating too much on television, avoiding the Vietnam draft, leaving the scene of an accident, and delivering a calm sermon on hemispheric drug conferences when asked how he would react to the rape and murder of his wife.
Such oddities are not pseudo-issues that take the place of discussing the budget deficit. With the exception of Richard Nixon's sweat glands, they are proxies for relevant questions of character. Michael Dukakis's lack of emotion did worry the electorate, perhaps rightly. So did the charge that he lacked patriotism, as implied by Mr Bush's visits to flag factories and harpings on the pledge of allegiance. So did the insinuation that he was soft on crime. That some of these charges were unfounded said something about Mr Bush's character, too--a point Mr Dukakis failed to make.
In the months ahead, horrible things will be done to Pericles's invention. Reporters will treat the election as a horse race in which being ahead means being right, rather than the other way around, and compress speeches into staccato soundbites for the evening news. Candidates will say what people want to hear, or what their advisers tell them people want to hear, rather than what they think. Absurd charges will be made to besmirch reputations and some will unfairly stick. Candidates will try to appear only in settings they control (speeches to admiring rallies, television commercials) and try to avoid spontaneous ones (press conferences, debates). Wise men who might have made excellent presidents will stand aside. For reason of historical accident, the people of New Hampshire will be fawned on by aspiring presidents, whereas those of North Dakota may never see a candidate in the flesh.
But good thins will also happen. Politicians will learn (if only through their pollsters) what is on the voters' minds. Some voters will learn what protectionism or health-care reform would entail. Above all, one person's mettle will be tested. If he proves to have the cunning of a Nixon, the virtue of a Carter, the phlegm of a Reagan and the level-headedness of a Bush, then he will be ideal.
American voters are not so foolish as to be taken in by everything that is thrown at them. When they eventually go to the polls, they will not be voting for the man who looks good in a Stetson hat, but for the man who most convinces them that his instincts, political and personal, are sound. The American presidential election is about personality as well as politics, and that is as it should be. Some of the excesses of mudslinging and boosterism would be better corrected; but fame without notoriety has been the goal of all candidates since Thomas Jefferson, and there is no reforming that."

In 1990 Mr Justice Henry spent more than 100 days on the bench, presiding over Britain's first Guinness trial. He has just spent another long spell on the same bench, for the second Guinness trial only to see it collapse in ignominy on February 11th (see page 90). Justification, perhaps, for a hint of judicial impatience at the end of it: ""It seems to me inevitable"", he said when discharging the jury, ""that we must find a cheaper and quicker way to deal with serious fraud trials, and the likelihood is we shall need a radical solution rather than merely tinkering with procedures."" To the beleaguered jurors, this message, at least, will have been clear: it is your fault. Not personally, of course, but the mere fact of trying a complex fraud case in front of a jury makes it longer and more accident-prone than if it were tried in front of an expert panel. That is also what the Roskill commission said in 1986. Yet the government was right to ignore Roskill then, and will be right to ignore Mr Justice Henry now.
It is important, first of all, to be clear why many people are unhappy about most of Britain's recent fraud trials. It cannot, and should not, be because ""the crooks have got away with it"". All defendants are innocent until proved guilty, so the prosecution's record should not be a test of the correctness of the process. In any event, that record is as mixed as you might expect it to be. On the same day that the Guinness trial collapsed, Peter Clowes was given a ten-year stretch for fraud in the Barlow Clowes case. In the first Guinness trial, the four defendants were found guilty on 28 of the 29 charges. The third Guinness trial was dropped, on February 7th, because the prosecution withdrew its case against the two defendants. The jury in the Blue Arrow case, in which five investment bankers are charged with misleading the market about a share issue in 1987, was about to reach its verdict when this newspaper went to press. There are only two legitimate reasons for worrying about fraud trials, and both have to do with their length. Any trial lasting for months is costly for the taxpayer. The first Guinness trial probably cost a total of L10m ($18m) or more, which is an expensive way to punish the manipulation of share prices during a takeover bid. Far more important, however, a long trial imposes a huge penalty on a defendant who might eventually be found not guilty. Roger Seelig, the former merchant banker whose ill-health promoted the collapse of the second Guinness trial, has paid with four years of his life and has still not had the charges dismissed or proven. His experience will serve as a powerful deterrent to others. But, regardless of the eventual outcome, it is still unjust.
To shorten fraud trials, Mr Justice Henry thinks something radical must be done. But why single out fraud? Plenty of other trials are long and complicated--big drugs cases, or murder trials involving psychiatric evidence. Plenty of other defendants spend too long awaiting trial and are pushed towards suicide before or after the verdict, so there is no reason to single out merchant bankers for special treatment. All that is why a royal commission is studying the whole of Britain's criminal-justice system--not simply fraud.
If that commission chooses to recommend that Britain stick with its adversarial method of trial rather than switching to the inquisitorial sort, the decision should also apply to fraud, and juries should be retained. No line can be drawn satisfactorily between fraud and other forms of theft to say why one deserves one system, one another. Lawyers would anyway spend months arguing which side of the line their case should be on. A tribunal of ""experts"" risks its own perversions of justice: an establishment protecting its own, or attacking those it dislikes.
And the jury system exerts an attractive discipline on prosecutors: if someone is to be put behind bars, the case must be made clear enough for laymen to understand. Clarity is always desirable, and anyway laymen are not as stupid as some judges seem to think.
NO SPECIAL CASES
If change is needed for fraud, it must come from judges and the prosecution. If Mr Justice Henry and his fellows think trials are too long, they can make more use of pre-trial hearings to whittle down charges. If the Serious Fraud Office feels it is failing in its task, it can change its tactics. So far it has generally opted to throw the book at defendants, using dozens of charges in the hope that at least some will stick. On February 11th Asil Nadir, former head of the now-defunct Polly Peck, was committed for trial on 69 charges. The alternative would be for the SFO to stick to the handful of charges on which it thinks its case is strongest.
Perhaps it should do so. But it is its job to choose."

Whenever they hold their peace, as they did over Iraq, they are called wimps. It seems they cannot win. But there is one thing on which Germany can fire its diplomatic Big Bertha without worry--the Uruguay round of the GATT.
Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, is this year's chairman of the Group of Seven top industrial countries. He will be host to its annual summit in Munich in July, and he can already imagine a flop there that no amount of foaming beer will rescue. In their communique after last year's party in London, the leaders wrote of the GATT talks: ""The aim should be to complete the round before the end of 1991. We shall each remain personally involved in this process, ready to intervene with one another if differences can only be resolved at the highest level."" Unless they salvage that promise and push through an agreement in GATT before the summer, their meeting in Munich risks being a mockery.
The sticking-point in the round remains the reluctance of the European Community, and of France in particular, to reshape a policy of helping farmers that is peculiarly disruptive of trade. This is not the round's only headache, nor is France its only villain. But, as things stand, the EC and France will take the blame if the Uruguay round fails.
Mr Kohl has both the motive and the clout to make sure that failure does not happen. His country's economy, dizzy after 18 months of giving eastern Germany mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, needs an improved GATT to steady its nerves by helping exporters far more important to it than its farmers. Mr Kohl told his cabinet last November that it would be a ""catastrophe"" if Europe's CAP brought down the Uruguay round.
On the other hand, no one can say of Mr Kohl that he is less exposed to farmers than other European leaders. Heimat-conscious Germany has a powerful farm lobby, which will be on display in April's state elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein. Nor can he be accused, as could his predecessor as G7 chairman, John Major, of caring little about the fate of the European Community. Mr Kohl knows all about Europe's love of farmers. He also has the authority, within Germany and outside, to keep it in perspective.
IRON, PLEASE, CHANCELLOR
His biggest worry is the plight of Francois Mitterrand, whose government has been rattling downwards in popular esteem faster than an Olympic bobsleigh. Solidarity with France is politically correct in Germany, and relations are currently frayed. Mr Kohl cannot too obviously push Mr Mitterrand into a climbdown on farms. What he needs is something to concentrate French minds in the European meetings that forge the EC'S position in the GATT talks.
That something should be the chilly prospect of a special G7 summit, to be called in late April if the Uruguay round is still deadlocked. The prospect of sitting isolated at the world's top table, with the eyes of even Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, averted in dismay, should prompt Mr Mitterrand to look for a way out. Mr Kohl will be in an ideal position to prepare such a summit, or to organise the concessions that will be needed to avoid it, when he has talks--as yet unannounced--with George Bush at Camp David next month. In 1992, like it or not, the German chancellor is Mr GATT."

In the past 45 years the armies of India and Pakistan have fought three wars, and many artillery duels, in its mountains. These have left Pakistan in control of the western third of the old princely state, which it calls Azad (""Free"") Kashmir; the remaining two thirds is the state of Jammu & Kashmir, the only one of India's 25 states with a Muslim majority.
That peculiarity is the crux of a cruel and bloody problem. For the past two years Muslim guerrillas, aided by Pakistan, have waged a terrorist campaign to wrest Kashmir away from India; in reply, India's soldiers have used torture, rape and murder to cow Kashmiris into submission or flight. On February 11th several thousand Muslims tried to march from Azad Kashmir across the ""line of control"" that separates Pakistan's forces from India's (see page 56). Meanwhile, because tourists no longer come to Srinagar's Dal lake, the economy has collapsed, adding poverty to Kashmir's violence and insecurity.
Is there a solution? For an answer, look first at the history books. When Britain in 1947 divided the Indian subcontinent into the independent nations of India and Pakistan, the princely states were given the choice of acceding to either India or Pakistan, or of being independent. Pressed by Lord Mountbatten, then viceroy of British India, most chose accession. Jammu & Kashmir was an anomaly. Its ruler, Maharajah Hari Singh, was a Hindu; almost 80% of his 4m subjects were Muslims. The best course would have been to divide the state. The Kashmir valley, with its Muslim majority, could then have joined Pakistan. Across the Pir Panjal mountains, Jammu, with its Hindu majority, could have joined India.
That is the wisdom of hindsight. What actually happened was that Pathan Muslims invaded from the west, encouraged by the Pakistani government, and Kashmiri Muslims rebelled against the maharajah--who then sought military help from Delhi. It arrived, but the price exacted by India's prime minister, the Kashmir-born Jawaharlal Nehru, was the accession of Jammu & Kashmir to India; Supposedly, this demonstrated Nehru's determination that India, for all its Hindu majority, would be a country for all religions. Mountbatten accepted the document of accession in October 1947, adding that ""as soon as law and order have been restored...the question of the state's accession should be settled by a reference to the people.""
BACK TO BASICS
So much for wishful thinking. Reality is that Kashmiris have never been consulted on their destiny. Pakistan still calls for the plebiscite first proposed in 1948 by the United Nations--but wants it to involve only a choice between joining India or Pakistan. India says its Kashmiris, by voting in local elections and adopting a state constitution, have in effect ratified their accession to India; it notes that the Simla Accord of 1972 commits Pakistan and India to discuss a ""final settlement"" over Kashmir on a bilateral basis, with no UN involvement. Both countries regard independence for Kashmir as unpalatable.
Their distaste is understandable. Pakistan feels Kashmiri independence would undermine the raison d'etre of Pakistan as the homeland of the subcontinent's Muslims. India fears the unleashing of fissiparous forces: if Kashmir leaves the union, why not Punjab or Assam or Tamil Nadu? There are politicians in both countries who plead the strategic importance of Kashmir's mountains.
These self-serving arguments should not go unchallenged. Pakistan does not need the few million Muslims in Kashmir any more than it needs the 100m in India. India may well loathe the separatists of the Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front as much as the Sikh secessionists in Punjab, but it cannot pretend the parallels are exact. Under article 370 of the Indian constitution, Kashmir has always had a special status, with non-Kashmiris forbidden to buy land in the valley (a ban that many Hindu chauvinists would like to flout with mass immigration). As for Kashmir's strategic importance, no general--be he from India, Pakistan or neighbouring China--would sensibly launch an invasion across the world's highest mountains.
Is independence, then, the answer to Kashmir's woes? No more, perhaps, than for Lesotho, Andorra or any other midget state landlocked in the mountains. But let Kashmiris decide that for themselves, through a referendum covering all the options. It may be impossible to rewrite history, but there is no shame in returning to its basics. If India wishes to influence the outcome, it should realise that to continue a policy of brutal repression is to feed, not starve, the separatism it fears."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224155819/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/5?accountid=14657,"Last week we published part of a memo sent by Lawrence Summers, the chief economist of the World Bank, to some colleagues. The memo pondered whether the Bank should ""encourage more migration of the dirty industries to the third world"" and said that ""the economic logic of dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest--wage country is impeccable"". We objected to Mr Summers's language but said his economics was hard to answer. Many people, it seems, disagree. Mr Summers, as one commentator put it, views the world through ""the distorting prism of market economics""; his ideas are ""a recipe for ruin""; and he ignores the real challenge, which is ""to find an equitable way of financing clean growth everywhere"".
The Bank says that Mr Summers, one of America's best economists, was merely trying to provoke debate. If so, it is to be hoped that he succeeds--and that the Bank does not, instead, go silent on the subject. Much thinking on ""clean development"" is muddled. It is a confusion that threatens to cause great, if well-intentioned, harm to the world's poorest people.
THE CLARIFYING LENS OF MARKET ECONOMICS
Mr Summers made three main points. First, the costs of pollution depend on earnings for one through death or injury; these costs are lowest in the poorest countries. Second, costs rise disproportionately as pollution increases; so shifting pollution from dirty places to clean ones reduces costs. Third, people value a clean environment more as their incomes rise; if other things are equal, costs fall if pollution moves from rich places to poor ones. On the face of it, each seems a reason to dump toxic waste in Africa. All three arguments share a distinctively economic premise: environmental policy involves trade-offs, and should seek a balance between costs and benefits.
If Mr Summers is wrong, why is he wrong? Many greens would say his premise is false. They appear to believe that the only acceptable amount of pollution is zero or--which looks more sensible, but is almost as daft--that all pollution above some arbitrarily low threshold must be stopped. This cannot be right. Controlling pollution is expensive (and many third-world countries can ill afford the expense), and the benefits (especially when levels of pollution are already low) may be small. Greens and eco-sceptics may disagree about these costs and benefits, and thus about where the proper balance should lie. But the notion that such a balance should in principle be struck--and that, as a result, the 'right"" level of pollution is greater than zero and varies according to circumstances--ought to be uncontroversial. Without that idea, intelligent discussion of environmental policy is impossible.
But then Mr Summers makes a further, crucial assumption. He supposes that the value of a life, or of years of life-expectancy, can be measured by an objective observer in terms of incomes per head-in other words, that an Englishman's life is worth more than the lives of a hundred Indians. This is naive utilitarianism reduced to an absurdity. It is so outlandish that even a distinguished economist should see that it provides no basis for World Bank policy.
True, many of the decisions that governments make (on health care, roads and so forth) reflect implicit, and sometimes explicit, answers to the question of how much an average life is worth. That is inescapable--but the key word, in a democracy at any rate, is ""average"". Few governments would care to defend a policy based on differences in valuations among groups--arguing, for instance, that society values an extra year of life for a white-collar worker more highly than that for a blue-collar worker. Yet this is the counterpart, within a rich country, of what Mr Summers appeared to be suggesting for the world.
Suppose then that the Bank and the other multilateral institutions regard the life of an African peasant as equal in value to the life of a broker on Wall Street--as they self-evidently should. What remains of Mr Summers's arguments? The answer still is: more than most environmentalists care to admit.
The greatest cause of misery in the third world is poverty. This must guide the priorities of poor-country governments and aid donors alike. If clean growth means slower growth, as it sometimes will, its human cost will be lives blighted by a poverty that would otherwise have been mitigated. That is why it would be wrong for the World Bank or anybody else to insist upon rich-country standards of environmental protection in developing countries. Often, policies that favour growth (such as setting world-market prices for energy and other resources) will lead to a cleaner environment, too; such policies should be vigorously promoted. But when a trade-off between cleaner air and less poverty has to be faced, most poor countries will rightly want to tolerate more pollution than rich countries do, in return for more growth.
So the migration of industries, including ""dirty"" industries, to the third world is indeed desirable. Not because life there is cheap; if anything, for the opposite reason. Those who insist on ""clean growth everywhere"" must either deny that there is ever a trade-off between growth and pollution control--or else argue that imposing rich-country standards for clean air worldwide matters more than helping millions of people in the third world to escape their poverty.
Environmental policy is immensely complicated. The debate over Mr Summers's memo is ignoring many issues altogether: global, as opposed to local, pollution; the links between trade policy and the environment (see page 78); the opportunities to promote growth and a cleaner environment at the same time; and so on. In working through all this, economic method--the weighing of costs and benefits--is indispensable. Mr Summers's morally careless arguments, intended seriously or otherwise, must not be allowed to discredit it."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224164093/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/6?accountid=14657,"Fretting over the Islamic revolution that Iran was threatening to export during the early 1980s, the world waved aside the growling intimations of Iraq's own brand of aggressiveness. Now something similar could be happening between those two old rivals for Gulf supremacy, but in reverse. Frustration with Saddam Hussein's powers of survival may be smothering signals that Iran's collective leadership, far from dropping its evangelical ambitions, is seeking the military wherewithal to back them up.
The world would be a better place without Mr Hussein, and no doubt some day will be. An American dagger, with a neon-lit CIA sign, is being dangled within reach of any Iraqi bold enough to seize it. Less melodramatically, America and its allies are losing patience with the dance that Iraq has been leading the United Nations inspectors sent to see that all weapons of mass destruction are found and dismantled (see page 46).
It is absurd to be gentle towards an Iraq that is doing its best to evade conditions laid down in the Gulf war ceasefire. Tougher treatment could mean, for a start, sending in soldiers with the inspectors, with commandos lurking if the inspectors are denied immediate access to any site. The threat to bomb buildings that are not thrown open could be held in reserve. The world has no duty to be nice to Mr Hussein.
On the other hand, getting rid of the man, even if it is feasible, is not necessarily of central importance to the ex-allies. The war left Iraq bitterly poor, fragmented and distressed; the ceasefire provided a unique chance to strip it of its most dangerous weapons, including its nuclear potential. So long as that task is completed, the Iraqi dictator is a danger only to his own people. Bad, but not as bad as the danger he used to be.
No such intrusive treatment awaits Iran. The Iranian regime came out of the Gulf war smelling of roses. It succeeded in persuading both sides that it was not against them. It re-established relations with Arab countries in the allied camp, above all with Saudi Arabia, while extending its influence in countries that supported Iraq, especially Sudan. In deference to its growing authority, the Gulf states agreed that security arrangements for the region should include a no-trespassers notice banning non-Gulf Arab countries, such as Egypt. The shah's swollen vision of Iran as policeman and protector of the Gulf is alive and well and living in Tehran.
LOANS, BRIDGES, BOMBS
The collapse of the Soviet Union eased the pressure on Iran's northern frontier. Iran lost no time in establishing relations with the new Muslim republics, opening embassies and striking economic deals. These are said to have included (though this is denied by Iran) a freelance bid to buy ex-Soviet nuclear scientists. Waking up to these developments, James Baker, America's secretary of state, has scurried this month to the republics to accelerate the opening of American embassies in an effort to counter any baleful Iranian influence.
The ""pragmatic"" face that some of Iran's rulers have worn since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini has won it interest from exporters and bankers alike. Iran has a huge foreign debt but an even bigger shopping list of infrastructure needs. Westerners compete to sell it stuff and lend it money (foreign loans are no longer shunned as un-Islamic).
Most of this is to the good. Iran's potential as mischief-maker was greater when the Islamic republic was prowling outside the Middle Eastern club than as a member tucked up inside. Yet caution is called for. Iran's proselytising zeal has not slackened. The regime is on good terms with Sudan's Islamic rulers, causing dismay in Eypt. It paid a chunk of the campaign expenses of the fundamentalists robbed of victory in Algeria's recent election; their support for Iraq in the Gulf war had cut them off from Saudi money. In contrast to earlier years, it now kicks at a half-open fundamentalist door. And it leads the rejection front opposing talks between Israel and the Arabs.
Moreover, Iran is building up its armed forces fast; according to one estimate, a quarter of its oil earnings last year went on defence. Although most experts believe that it is still ten years away from a nuclear weapon, it has been seeking nuclear-related technology from China (which has helped it to develop a second small research reactor), Argentina, India, Pakistan and Germany. Iran, like Iraq, is a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The lesson of Iraq in the 1980s is that Iran must now be watched, questioned and kept under pressure."

It will begin soon, with auctions of small enterprises. Within a year, officials say, more than 100,000 shops and most of the country's light industry will be in private hands. In later phases, and just as quickly, the rest of the economy will be sold (see page 85). Nobody should now doubt that, under Boris Yeltsin, Russia's new leaders are set on economic transformation without delay.
Mr Yeltsin is right to be impatient, and to understand that privatisation is crucial if his other reforms are to succeed. Unfortunately, though, his new plan is not going to work. It is too ambitious--not in its scope, which is rightly all-encompassing, but in its methods, which rely on administrative skills that no advanced industrial country, let alone Russia, possesses. When the plan runs into trouble, as it quickly will, Mr Yeltsin will be tempted to delay it and make it less comprehensive. Instead, he should stay true to his radical instincts--and simplify.
CAPITALISM NEEDS CAPITALISTS
Russia's new privatisation programme involves targets, lots of them. The responsibility for meeting these targets--so many enterprises to be sold by such-and-such a date--has been devolved, in the best tradition of central planning, to local authorities. To complicate matters further, alongside them will be an entirely new bureaucracy of full-time privatisation officials. Russian workers are to be given shares in the enterprises they work for, according to a formula that will link the maximum value of their shares to the minimum wage; newly privatised enterprises will be required to help their workers buy shares in other enterprises; and so on.
The plan seems doomed even before it begins. Without waiting for anybody's permission, enterprises are starting, in effect, to privatise themselves. Workers and managers are taking control as though they already own the assets. When the government's programme is delayed or abandoned, as seems all too likely, this process of ""spontaneous privatisation"" is likely to accelerate.
It is tempting to say ""fine"". What matters most, after all, is that Russia's producers should respond to incentives to run their enterprises more efficiently. The government's recent price reforms were intended to provide those incentives: the scarcer the good, the higher its price, and the greater the reward for increasing its production. But Russia's state-owned firms are accountable to nobody for the way they use resources, least of all to the former central planners; and the flow of soft credit from suppliers and state-run banks makes the discipline of bankruptcy seem infinitely postponable. Incentives are therefore ignored. If, instead, workers and managers regarded themselves as de facto owners of each enterprise's capital, they would start to think like businessmen, and the economy's supply side would begin to respond. Perhaps spontaneous privatisation should be encouraged, by simply declaring workers and managers to be legal co-owners of their enterprises.
Before long the Russian government may have no choice but to do just that, legalising a transfer of assets that has become a fact. But while Mr Yeltsin still has time, he should take steps to avoid it, because spontaneous privatisation has two huge disadvantages.
The first is that it is patently unfair. Some workers will become part-owners of enterprises with a future; they will have secure jobs and some wealth to go with it. Others will be part-owners of nothing; soon they will have neither job nor shareholding. Such random disparities will cause friction, and may entrench opposition to all aspects of Mr Yeltsin's reforms. In a young and insecure democracy, it is essential that the government maintains consent for its policies.
Eastern Europe's earlier experiments with worker-controlled firms point to the other drawback of spontaneous privatisation: it would discourage flexibility in the markets for capital and labour, the very flexibility that privatisation is intended to bring about. Foreign investors, for instance, are likely to be more cautious about sharing ownership with workers than with fellow capitalists. Worker-owners of successful firms may resist expansion for fear of diluting their stakes; and worker-owners of unsuccessful ones will fight lay-offs. Worker-ownership, in short, is not capitalism.
The quickest way to achieve far-reaching privatisation and a genuine market economy is to give the enterprises away. Create half a dozen investment funds, staffed partly by westerners (paid by results), and divide the enterprises among them; then give an equal, tradable share in each of these funds to every citizen. This in itself would be a formidable task--but far easier than running Russia's massively complicated scheme, and easier also than the too-clever voucher schemes that Poland and Czechoslovakia have been struggling to introduce. Above all, a pure give-away means that privatisation can proceed before, rather than after, bureaucrats or market forces have valued the enterprises. If spontaneous privatisation, and the harm it will do, are to be avoided, speed is everything."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224132610/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/8?accountid=14657,"Last month a British high-court judge made an extraordinary decision. A refugee who had fled from Sudan to Germany, and then to Britain, had been promptly ordered by the British government back to Germany, which had been his first safe port of call. No, said the judge. He ordered the government to halt the man's deportation, accepting that in Germany he might be in danger of attack by neo-Nazi thugs. It was the first time for many years that anyone had sought asylum from Germany for fear of racial persecution.
Attacks on immigrants have risen steeply across the European Community in the past year. A German government report recently leaked to the press showed that recorded attacks on foreigners there leapt tenfold between 1990 and 1991, to almost 200 a month. Axenophobic upswell has delivered new support for the far right. In Italian municipal elections last October, the Lombard League, primarily anti-Roman but also anti-immigrant, got the highest vote in the northern town of Brescia. In Belgium's general election last November, the anti-immigrant Flemish Block won a quarter of the votes in Antwerp. In France nearly a third of respondents tell opinion-pollsters that they agree with the leader of the National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, on immigration. A blaze of publicity now surrounds his campaign for the coming regional elections.
The appeal to anti-immigrant sentiment has found fertile ground recently because realistic fears of an exodus from the ex-communist states have coincided in Western Europe with faltering economies and worries that national identity may be under threat from Brussels. The healthy feeling that binds together the societies of Europe's nation-states now seems to be breeding something far from healthy, a mindless intolerance of outsiders.
Politicians seeking to contain this sentiment have two choices. They can reject popular racism and seek to calm fears about immigration. Or they can pander to these fears, arguing publicly that native citizens will be less hostile to the newcomers if they believe there are no more coming after them, while hoping privately that voters who would otherwise back the nasty far right will rally behind their virtuous selves. Several governments seem to be taking this path, yielding to the clamour for tougher immigration controls. In France last year politicians of all stripes fell over each other to describe an ""invasion"" of immigrants, their ""noise and smell"", or to call for deportation. What was once the seamy stuff of far-right politics is becoming mainstream.
DOUBLE-BOLTING THE DOORS
Those who fear mass immigration point out that the EC sits next to two areas full of poor people: the disintegrating ex-communist countries to the east, and the poor ones across the Mediterranean. Scaremongers--among them, Russian social scientists keen to frighten the Community into sending more aid their way--forecast that 8m-9m people could soon flood in from the former Soviet Union. Most western demographers dismiss this as nonsense. But even realistic estimates suggest 1m-2m might apply from the ex-communist countries this year alone.
Meanwhile, populations south of the Mediterranean are mushrooming. North Africa's population is expected to double over the next 30-35 years. Around 40% of Maghrebians are aged under 15. Their income levels are at best a sixth of those in Europe. Hundreds of thousands more may be tempted to seek their fortunes there.
Yet only the first half of this story is new. Nearly 20 years ago, after the 1973 oil shock, fears of immigration from poor countries prompted rich ones like France, Britain, Germany and Holland to shut their doors. Since then they have maintained tight controls, reserving entry mainly for skilled workers, the spouses or children of immigrants already settled, and refugees. Two-thirds of the 52,000 permanent settlers admitted to Britain in 1990, for example, were joining relatives already in the country.
One reason immigration fears have been reawakened is the EC'S 1992 programme. At Maastricht last December, EC governments agreed to draw up a joint list of countries whose citizens would need visas to enter the Community. But permanent immigration and the right of asylum have been left to national governments, which will work towards common admission rules in future. How will they control migration meanwhile? Some countries will keep border controls. But already eight--all except Denmark, Greece, Britain and Ireland--have signed the Schengen accord, which will end intra-EC passport checks.
The northern countries, which have long since closed their gates, are now looking nervously at their Mediterranean partners, relatively unaccustomed, except for France, to heavy immigration. They fear that illegal migrants, having slipped into, say, Portugal or Spain, will be unchecked all the way to the North Sea. So the southerners have been hurriedly installing the paraphernalia of immigration control. Italy, for example, having first granted an amnesty for illegal immigrants two years ago, is now clamping down. It has a strict quota system, and has already introduced visas for Turks and North Africans. The Schengen countries are also setting up a computer system to pool police information on criminals, including illegal immigrants.
Because tough controls have been bolted into place, only Germany--thanks to unification and the influx of ethnic Germans from eastern Europe--now has much immigration. The statistics are imprecise. But the best estimate (by Philip Muus, at the University of Amsterdam) is that, excluding ethnic Germans, net inflow to the EC in 1989 was 517,000, about 0.2% of its population. This includes asylum-seekers, some of whom are not allowed to stay. Even allowing for the recent surge in asylum-seekers--there were some 325,000 new applications in 1990 alone, over half to Germany--the figures do not constitute a tidal wave.
By American standards, Western Europe should be able to absorb millions more. Excluding Americans and EC nationals living in each others'countries--and nowhere are these a big issue--only 2.3% of the EC's inhabitants are foreign citizens. In the United States, excluding Europeans and Canadians, 3.7% are. Forecasts for net yearly immigration to the EC during the 1990s range from 200,000 to 750,000, ethnic Germans included. Even the higher figure would add only 0.3% a year to the total.
HANDS NEEDED
Demography and economics together suggest that Europe might do better to open its doors wider. Europeans now live longer and have fewer babies than they used to. The burden of a growing host of elderly people is shifting on to a dwindling number of young shoulders. Few people argue for unrestricted immigration: even if voters would accept it, receiving countries could be overwhelmed. But a relaxation of the controls on unskilled workers would help plug the demographic gap. ""It is absolutely clear that, because of demographics, we will have to open the tap of immigration. We cannot avoid it, even if we wanted to,"" says an official at the French social-affairs ministry.
Not all social scientists, however, accept this argument. Projections made by David Coleman, of Oxford University, suggest that immigration could not solve the problem of an ageing population anyway. Soon after baby-booming immigrant families arrive in the West, he argues, they slip into the western habit of having few children. His solution is to persuade more mothers to work.
That misses an important point, though. Immigrants, often driven by poverty at home, are willing to take the back-breaking or night-time jobs which nationals increasingly shun. Vacancies for this sort of work can co-exist with high unemployment. Immigrants are often readier to work for low wages. As residents, Europeans may object to immigrants; as consumers of cheap goods and services, most appreciate them.
LET THEM BE CITIZENS
If logic ruled human affairs, this might seem to be the end of the argument. Not quite. A willing pair of hands also needs a roof over its head, schools for its kids and so on. And Europe faces not one willing pair but, potentially, millions. Yet even if all those could be housed and schooled, governments know that logic has little place in this debate. They would go on limiting immigration, because tribal feeling tells them to.
At the same time, strangely, they are neglecting, in some ways even hampering, the absorption of the immigrants they already have. One of those ways is the refusal of citizenship. Of the Community's 8m brown and black residents--about as many people as live in Belgium--many do not qualify for citizenship. Let them become citizens, it is arguable, and they would be both more accepted and better adapted to be so.
European countries hand out citizenship on widely varying criteria. France, for example, the country that Mr Le Pen wants to save from an invasion of foreigners, has millions of citizens who you might think had invaded it already. Their names sound Spanish, Italian, Polish, Arab. Yet French they are, thanks to France's liberal nationality law. A foreigner can become French if he was born in and lives in France, whatever his parents' nationality; or, wherever born, had one French parent; or marries a French citizen.
In contrast, the Germans still cling to the idea that one either is born German or is not German. Thus 3m ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe have the automatic right to German passports; the German-born children of foreigners do not, and need a work permit to get a job, just like their parents. These foreigners are officially regarded as exactly that, temporary migrants who should do their jobs and leave. Yet today 60% of Germany's foreigners have lived there for more than ten years, and more than two-thirds of foreign children were born there. Even so, Germany does not see itself as a country of immigration. Its govemment actively promotes repatriation, and pays a small sum to families who return ""home"".
True, Turks or Yugoslavs can become German. But few do. The would-be citizen has to fight through bureaucracy proving, among other things, his financial security, knowledge of the language and respect for German culture. Fewer than 1% of Germany's Turks, the biggest immigrant group, are citizens. (More may be so in future: the law was relaxed slightly last year for young German-born foreigners).
The reason is that Germans (and Belgians) tend to see citizenship as the end of the process of integration. Most immigrants are not ready for it, they argue, because they do not fit in, economically or socially. In contrast, the Swedes see citizenship as one step towards integration: let the stranger fit in legally, and he will find it easier to fit in in practical ways. Citizenship is no panacea: Britain's young blacks and France's young Arabs often still feel they are outsiders, though most are citizens by birth. Yet Dutch Antilleans in Holland--who enjoy full citizenship there--do better at school, and are far less prone to be out of work, than non-citizen Turks (partly, perhaps, because they know Dutch better; but that does not seem to be the whole explanation).
Even if governments will not make citizenship easy, they could offer non-citizens the vote. Few do. Denmark and Holland let foreigners vote in local elections. Britain, for historical reasons, lets Commonwealth (and Irish) citizens vote in all elections. Now that Maastricht has paved the way for nationals of EC countries to vote in local elections anywhere in the EC, the grounds for denying the same to other foreigners, especially ones born in Europe, look flimsy.
HIJAB VERSUS JEANS
Legal status, though, is the smaller part of integration. Most second-generation immigrants in countries like France, Britain and Holland have the same formal rights as any other citizen--but not the same acceptance.
It is easy enough, and often true, to blame this on racism in the host society. But that does not help much. ""They aren't like us"" is a lamentable but universal human sentiment, and likely to remain so. When you have finished preaching against that sentiment, and legislating against it being translated into action, the question remains how ""like us"" you can expect ""them"" to be.
Europe does not know. In America things are relatively simple: accept that you are Americans, accept the flag and the constitution, and you and your group can then organise yourselves as you please. In Europe, by contrast, the feeling of nationality is fuzzier, the historical sediment of folk myths, custom and history. You cannot expect Mr or Master Patel, or Mlle Benhouhou and her parents, to share those myths overnight or perhaps ever. What can you expect? And how far does it matter if they and their kind prefer to stick to their own myths?
Or their own religion, language, food or clothes? Many Europeans who resent immigration say they do not mind foreigners, whatever their colour, so long as they behave ""like us"". That certainly helps. The smooth professional--or, in his field, the sportsman--fully assimilated to the ways of local society arouses little antagonism.
One such is Harlem Desir, the dapper, coffee-coloured leader of a lobbying group in France, SOS Racisme. Dressing and speaking like any educated Frenchman, he has no problem winning acceptance from officialdom. Life will remain harder for those not so assimilated. Yet time will bring a remedy--if they choose to take it. Mr Desir believes they will: the hijab that North Affican women wear to go modestly in the street will eventually give way to jeans. Frenchborn Arabs, he argues, who have coined terms (beurs in Paris, calos in Lille) to distinguish themselves from their immigrant parents, are increasingly switching to the culture of the West. But the pendulum can swing the other way. Some European-born youngsters express themselves more ethnically than their immigrant parents. Most of the young British blacks in Rastafarian dreadlocks are the children, or indeed grandchildren, of those tidy Jamaican men who stepped off the steamer 40 years ago in suits and trilbies. Partly this is fashion; but it reflects also a human need to find roots, however sentimental.
Governments too play their part. The Dutch and British in effect discourage assimilation by giving state aid to ethnic groups. In Britain all sorts have applied for the official ""ethnic minority"" label, including Sikhs, gypsies and the Irish (all accepted) and Rastafarians (rejected). State money subsidises adult classes in languages such as Urdu and Hindi, and even helps to build mosques or temples.
To the French (or Belgian) eye, such support for imported cultures is weird. These countries flatly reject such notions. They treat immigrants as individuals: you either become French, or Belgian, or remain a foreigner. There is no group half-way house.
Which policy works better is an open question. French law and custom insist that the state keep out of religion--and vice versa. But France is home to 3m (and land of citizenship to 1-1/2M of these) of the EC's 5m Muslims, whose tradition is different. Every so often there is an outcry when Islamic culture is too visibly displayed; as when, a couple of years ago, three Muslim girls wore head-scarves to school. One French businessman complains: ""What they get up to at home is their business. But when they start praying in the street or in the factory, it offends against the values of the republic.""
The British state, in contrast, is formally linked to the church. Yet just because it is officially Christian, it must let other religions too blur the line between public and private. Sikhs in uniform wear the turban of their religion. Even when Muslim zealots openly supported Ayatollah Khomeini's decree that Salman Rushdie be killed for his book offensive to Islam, they were not prosecuted. When a self-appointed ""Muslim parliament"", in part led by such extremists, was recently set up, few (save other Muslims, maybe) would have objected, had it stuck to calling for Muslim schools to get state finance, as some Jewish and many Christian ones do. Only when the ""parliament"" invited Britain's Muslims to ignore the law where it was ""inimical"" to Muslim interests, did an irritated government feel the need to remind minorities to keep religion in its own sphere. Public reaction, however, was hostile; in the end, these Muslims' fair claim to the full rights of citizenship was damaged by the authorities' failure to ensure firmly that they respect its duties.
NEW EUROPEANS
No one can doubt that immigrants add to the vitality of nations. They bring new blood, new ideas, new aspirations, France's recently created minister for integration, Kofi Yamgnane, an affable black Frenchman of Togolese origin, believes one of his most useful jobs is to convince the French that Africans have more to offer than football skills and rhythmic music; things such as family cohesion, respect for the elderly, non-material values.
Yet Europe has to find a way of knitting together the many tribes within its borders. Working towards a common European citizenship will test how inclusive it is prepared to be. The EC might even offer a useful new identity--akin to feeling, say, Polish-American--to the European-born children of immigrants, unable, some of them, to identify easily with the nation that their parents joined. Over two centuries, millions of immigrants have gone to the new world and become Americans. The result is less than harmony. But if the EC will not treat its immigrants--or even, in Germany, their children--as citizens, it may yet do even worse."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224159316/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/9?accountid=14657,"Time was when the fledgling cable industry, caged in by regulations, was overshadowed by three fat, smug broadcasting companies, ABC, NBC and CBS, and their network affiliates. Congress, in 1984, then set the cable industry free, expecting a little fun at the broadrcasters'expense. It got more than it had bargained for.
In seven short years revenues from cable television have leapt past the combined revenues of the big three networks. Three-fifths of all households have cable. Although viewers now get more programmes to watch, monopolist cable systems have made them pay and pay. Between 1986 and 1990 cable rates rose by 61%, at three times the rate of inflation. Most cable systems are monopolies in their local area; many loaded up with debt during the 1980s and are now skimping on promised services.
Congressmen have noticed that whenever they attend a town meeting, somebody seems to be complaining about cable rates. Smelling votes, and reluctant to lose their paternalist role in overseeing television, they are now bent on re-regulating the cable industry. The networks and independent stations, hurt by the recession, are urging them on.
The latest congressional action is a Senate bill passed overwhelmingly on January 31st. The bill calls for cable rates to be regulated where competition does not exist with other cable or ""multi-channel"" suppliers--ie, most places. It limits the number of subscribers a cable operator can serve nationwide. And it calls for programmes made by a programmer-maker for its own cable affiliates to be sold to others for the same price. This is damaging for such a vertically integrated industry.
Take two companies, Time Warner and Tele-Communications Inc (TCI). Between them these two own, at least in part, the companies that supply cable to a third of all viewers on America's 11,000 local cable franchises. Time Warner, a media giant, is the country's biggest film and programme producer and owns Home Box Office (HBO). In the cable business, TCI and its affiliates make even Time Warner look small. It has annual revenues of $4 billion and stakes in cable programmers, including CNN and the Discovery Channel. The networks and budding satellite stations, complain that such vertically integrated stations stifle competition by denying others their programmes--except at exorbitant prices.
Congress is approaching its regulatory task with crusading zeal, spurred on by the memory of its earlier deregulatory bungle. Senators involved with the bill refer to the ""cable Cosa Nostra"". Yet a zealous Congress could mess things up further. For instance, the Senate bill puts the onus of regulation on local authorities--the very ones that have often been cajoled and bribed into granting franchises. True, local authorities would be able to defer to the Federal Communications Commission. But that body privately admits it is alarmed by the new burden.
Congress, meanwhile, is intent on reasserting its public-policy role in broadcasting. The big three networks, after all, were originally given free use of the airwaves in return for a commitment to ""public service"". They had to provide some news and weather bulletins, for instance, and broadcast some public-interest messages. Moreover, they could not charge viewers to watch. If television was to be the electronic hearth, government would make sure everyone had firewood. These principles still hold today.
Since the broadcasters' signals are transmitted free to all end-users, cable operators have long picked them up and passed them on to customers (usually with a better picture) as just one more service. Broadcasters, indeed, used to insist that they did so, until a 1985 court ruling struck down such insistence as unconstitutional. Roughly half of what viewers watch on cable at prime times comes from the broadcast networks. Broadcasters, rather illogically, feel they are being duped. They have had inserted in the Senate bill the right to ask cable operators for a transmission fee that could raise $3 billion a year. Still more illogically, broadcasters could give up the fee and instead compel cable to carry their broadcast.
Broadcasters charging for a free service: surely Congress has gone awry? Maybe it should remind itself of a general principle. Technology will change faster than government's ability to regulate it. Multi-channel television is a perfect example. Certainly, cable television currently has monopolistic tendencies. But these are already being challenged--not least by other cable operators. The number of cities with competing cable has doubled, to 50, since 1989.
Soon competition in multi-channel television will also come from direct-broadcast satellites (in Europe these pose a greater threat than cable to established television) and from microwave television. This highlights another example of government myopia. Handing out free chunks of the spectrum to broadcasters, and giving much of the rest away in lotteries, is an opportunity outrageously forgone. Estimates of revenues that could be raised by auctioning the airwaves begin at $50 billion, $11 billion of which would come from television. It is hard to imagine that the ""public interest"" can be better served without such money in the Treasury.
INFOVISION
But competition for people's television sets will soon mean more than sating the appetite of the inchoate herd of American channel-grazers. It will be, in the optimistic futurism of a stock analyst, Christopher Dixon of Paine Webber, ""a turf battle for the electronic highway into the home."" Such a highway will soon be carrying much more than bog-standard cable. Instead it will carry telecommunications, databases, tailor-made television programming, classified advertisements, you name it. That will create direct competition with telephone companics, electronic mail and newspapers.
The first stage of this process, expanding the number of channels that can be puniped into a home, has already begun. HBO is experimenting with multiplexing--using several channels to show the same film at different times, so you can watch when you choose. Time Warner has a 150-channel experiment in the New York borough of Queens. TCI is experimenting in Denver with a pay-per-view library of films ftom which to choose.
Multichannel technology will need, first, optical-fibre cables--not all the way to people's homes, but to a local hub from which common coaxial cable can take over. Second, it will require digital-compression technology, which can squeeze ten channels on to one. In both development and investment, cable companies lead the field. They have already laid around a fifth of their network with optical fibres; America's telephone companies have barely begun.
Yet the impending congressional action is only too likely to rein back cable's undoubtedly large investment in providing what people increasingly want. The best way to encourage more investment as well as more competition on Mr Dixon's highway is to let more businesses at it. The Baby Bell telephone companies come first to mind. The trouble is that their operations are heavily circumscribed by govemment on the basis of their local monopolies in telecommunications. The Baby Bells' efforts to break into information services are being strenuously blocked by legislators.
But look at it this way. Cable operators will soon have the means to compete with the Baby Bells in telecoms. That is no bad thing, so neither is the reverse. Besides, letting telecoms companies into information services challenges perhaps the most complacent of all local monopolies--newspapers. Services such as stock quotes and classified ads are ready for electronic migration. Yet newspapers have fiercely guarded their right to cover readers' fingers with ink.
The right communications policy for America is one that maximises revenues for government and lays out an open field for competition. This is, alas, too simple an idea for a Congress intent on daring George Bush in an election year to veto a crackdown on the unloved cable industry."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224143906/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/10?accountid=14657,"""What happens here Monday is much larger than just your home-state boy running."" Tom Harkin's assessment of the first test of the 1992 presidential race was pardonably self-serving, but wrong. The Iowa caucuses on February 10th, first tests of the 1992 campaign, were a non-event, precisely because a home-state senator, Mr Harkin, was running. Although he won the support of 78% of the Democrats taking part, it was on a low turnout--less than 30,000, compared with 120,000 in 1988. In second place was Mr Undecided, who got 12%, or more than all other candidates put together.
When they picked Jimmy Carter from nowhere in 1976, Iowa's caucuses became the bellwether of the presidential campaign. But this year the true beginning to the campaign is once more, as it was before 1976, New Hampshire's primary on February 18th. Whoever wins or does well there will gather valuable ""momentum"" and media attention. But his task is only beginning.
Five days after the New Hampshire primary, Maine holds caucuses on February 23rd. A caucus is a local meeting at which head counts are made of supporters for each candidate. It attracts fewer, and more passionate, voters than a primary: in 1988, only 2% of Maine's electorate turned out.
This benefits campaigns with either superior organisation or powerful ideological appeal. As in New Hampshire, the flavour of this campaign has been dominated by economic anxiety. The recession has cost the state 35,000 jobs over the past year and driven up bankruptcies to four times the average of the 1980s. The Republican governor, John McKernan, pushed through a $300m tax increase last summer, Maine's first since 1974, made budget cuts of $105m in November, and is still facing a $200m spending gap. Even lobster prices on the Portland docks have been falling.
The Republican race does not really exist. Pat Buchanan is expected to make just one campaign visit to Maine; George Bush none at all--unless something drastic happens in New Hampshire.
The Democrats, however, will descend in full force for the five days between New Hampshire and the caucuses. A debate is planned for February 21st. Bill Clinton is well organised, and is a friend from Rhodes-scholar days of Tom Allen, the mayor of Portland. Paul Tsongas has spent more time in Maine than the others, but attracts sober realists, not the zealots who go to caucuses. Tom Harkin's opposition to a trade agreement with Mexico has been popular with textile workers, but public support from local union organisations has been slow to coalesce. Bob Kerrey's campaign has been prominent on television but less evident on the ground. Jerry Brown has been popular in universities, but his campaign has lacked money, operating until recently out of a volunteer's apartment and recycling materials--lapel stickers and lawn signs--from the earlier Brown presidential campaigns.
After Maine, the first primary that counts is South Dakota's on February 25th. Mr Harkin and Mr Kerrey are from neighbouring states, so it will be the first chance each has to knock out the other. In the tradition of William Jennings Bryan and George McGovern, South Dakota's farmbelt populism may benefit Mr Harkin.
Then, on March 3rd, two states that include regional capitals, Georgia and Colorado, hold primaries that will attract attention. Although Georgia, along with most of the south, usually votes Republican in presidential elections, it is fiercely proud of its Democratic politics (Georgia has never had a Republican governor, for instance). Unhappy with being lumped with other southern states into ""Super-Tuesday"" last time, it has moved its primary forward a week. That makes it the south's vanguard.
And Bill Clinton's Waterloo? As a southerner, Mr Clinton has the approval of nearly every politician in Georgia, from the governor, Zell Miller, down. He is the only candidate with a campaign team in the state. The only worry is that, this being the Bible belt, people might have more than usually censorious views of adulterers and draft-dodgers, so even a charge that Mr Clinton is both could prove fatal. If he fails, it is not clear who will benefit. Mr Kerrey has the support of Georgia's secretary of state, also a Vietnam veteran, and he drew a big crowd last month at a party held in a posh Atlanta house. Several of the guests, however, admitted they were more curious about the house's famed interior.
On the same day as Georgia tells the south how to vote, Colorado tells the west. This is the first time any western state has held its primary so early. But is there a distinctive western voice that has, in the past, gone by default? This is of particular interest to the Democrats. Although the west as a whole has tended to be Republican in presidential elections, Mr Dukakis did surprisingly well from the Rockies to the Pacific. As a breed, western Democrats may be keener on environmentalism, more suspicious of big government and less protectionist than their brethren to the east. They are also more tolerant of adultery and draft-dodging.
Colorado is unlikely to be a happy hunting ground for Mr Harkin, a self-styled ""real"" (for which read old-fashioned) Democrat. Mr Tsongas, who has a sister in the state, has started organising there a little late. Mr Brown will need to have done well somewhere else if he is to catch fire in Colorado. So the main race will probably be between Mr Clinton and Mr Kerrey.
Mr Kerrey is the local man; his home state of Nebraska is next door. Mr Clinton's supporters say that they want to show, early, that their man can win outside his base in the south, and that he has a good network of political contacts in the race. An early Denver Post poll (post-Gennifer Flowers but before the charge that he had manipulated his way out of the Vietnam draft) had him in the lead. He is matching Mr Kerrey for endorsements from local Democratic bigwigs, though neither of them will get the endorsement both would like--that of Roy Romer, the state's popular governor. He is chairing the Democrats' platform committee this year and has said that he will stay neutral.
Meanwhile, there is a chance of fun on the Republican side. Colorado Republicans tend to be conservative, and Pat Buchanan, the challenger to George Bush, has said how much he admires Bill Armstrong, who retired as a Republican senator from the state in 1990. Local politicos think that Mr Buchanan may be endorsed by the newspaper in Colorado Springs, the state's solidly Republican second city."

Still, a heavyweight champion must live in a world where proportions are gone. He is conceivably the most frightening unarmed killer alive. With his hands he could slay 50 men before he became too tired to kill any more.""
Norman Mailer's breathless paean to the psychosis of the heavyweight boxer was written about George Foreman in the 1970s, but it could equally have been inspired by Sonny Liston in the 1960s or by Mike Tyson in the 1980s. Boxing fans have always liked to believe that their heroes are villains. Mr Tyson in particular was consistently presented as the incarnation of the violence of the American ghetto--terrifying to middle America in real life, but strangely thrilling when safely enclosed behind the ropes of a boxing ring and packaged for television.
After his conviction for rape in Indianapolis, Mr Tyson's sympathisers are already arguing that he is the victim of a system that set him up for an inevitable fall. The destroyers of Iron Mike are variously cast as his handlers, interested only in his money-making potential; a largely white, midwestern jury willing to believe the worst of a black from the inner city; the media (always a useful scapegoat); and feminists, desperate to secure a victory after the debacles of Clarence Thomas and William Kennedy Smith.
The contrast between the conviction of Mr Tyson and the acquittal of Mr Smith is inevitably being cast as a matter of class and race. This ignores the more obvious explanation that Mr Smith may have been innocent and Mr Tyson may have been guilty. Certainly the medical evidence for rape was much stronger in the Tyson than in the Smith trial, although the circumstantial evidence for consent may also have been stronger.
The different fates of Mr Smith and Mr Tyson may have had a lot to do with the skill of the prosecution. In most cases where a rich celebrity is in the dock, like the trials of Mr Smith and Imelda Marcos, the resources and skills of the defence far outshine the lacklustre local prosecutors. But in the trial of Mr Tyson the prosecutor, Greg Garrison, was a hired gun brought in specially to try the case. The Tyson trial was unusual in that it was the prosecution that was flamboyant and is emotional and the defence that seemed mechanical.
It is now widely assumed that Mr Tyson's boxing career is over. This seems premature. He will appeal against the verdict and even if he serves many years in prison he will probably be released in his mid-30s. Former champions like George Foreman and Larry Holmes are still fighting well into their 40s.
Then there is the prospect that Mr Tyson may continue his career while incarcerated. There is a precedent. James Scott, a rated light-heavyweight, fought from prison in the 1970s. Most commentators dismiss the idea of Mr Tyson fighting for the title from a state penitentiary as unimaginably tasteless; but considerations of taste have done little to deter boxing promoters in the past. Indeed the evil and frightening images of boxers has tended to add to their appeal--a convicted rapist fighting from behind bars could provide the ultimate frisson."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224171234/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/12?accountid=14657,"Occasionally it is possible to feel sorry for even the most vilified American company: when the first wave of lawyers appears on the horizon. On February 10th Dow Corning admitted that it knew 20 years ago that silicone breast implants might leak; it also replaced its chairman with a proven crisis manager. It may be too late. Whatever the outcome of the Food and Drug Administration's investigation into the implants (which have yet to be found unsafe), a legal feeding frenzy seems certain.
The blondes who in magazine advertisements used to tout the benefits of ""reconstructive sculpture"" have been replaced by less photogenic lawyers offering their services to victims. Horror stories are flying around the plastic-surgery world. In Cape Cod a dozen lawsuits were introduced in one day; in Texas one lawyer started 50 suits in a week; in Washington state an advertised ""breast information helpline"" connects the caller to a lawyer's office.
Since nobody knows, as yet, the exact number of cases filed, some of these scare stories may be exaggerated. Indeed, some of the advertisements may even count as ""barratry"", the offence of maliciously inciting lawsuits. Yet breast implants look much too tempting for the litigation profession, fresh from a string of financially rewarding triumphs over asbestosis, tobacco and pollution, to pass them up. The national trial lawyers' association already has a ""breast implant litigation group"".
The first target is Dow Corning (and other manufacturers), which has already received more than 200 lawsuits. Its liability may eventually reach $1 billion. In December one woman was awarded over $7m from the company. As a joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, the company has no listed equity, but its bonds have been downgraded. ""Warning, warning, Sell Dow Corning"" rhymed Prudential Securities' bond-watchers recently.
Behind Dow Corning lie its two bigger and much fatter parents. In theory, they are protected by a ""corporate veil"", limiting their liability: even if Dow Corning went bankrupt, they could not be sued because they are separate companies. Such fine distinctions may be difficult to maintain when politicians are demanding satisfaction. Some investors even worry that there may be some 20-year-old ""smoking gun"" memorandum about the safety of the implants buried deep in one of the companies' vaults.
Plastic surgeons are also being named in lawsuits. Any doctor mentioned in a lawsuit will hire a lawyer, and claim the fee from his insurance. One Texas malpractice insurer, who calls breast-implants ""the biggest crisis yet,"" reckons the annual premium for plastic surgeons of $20,000-80,000 will jump by at least 20%. Many states have statutes of limitation, stopping malpractice suits after as little as one year. The inevitable result is that some plastic surgeons are refusing to see old patients with problems.
If previous excitements, such as the asbestosis flurry, are anything to go by, two things are certain: first, the lawsuits will rumble on for years, probably decades; second, most of the parties will soon sue each other. It is already tempting for plastic surgeons named in suits to sue Dow Corning. The company has observed that some surgeons may have made things worse, either by inserting the implants clumsily or by advising patients to rub them."

Eighteen months later, after Mr Shore had crossed and recrossed New Hampshire more times than is sensible for anyone, Mr Hart won a stunning victory over Walter Mondale in the 1984 primary. In February 1992, Mr Shore is in New Hampshire again, this time as the chief adviser to Bob Kerrey, a senator from Nebraska seeking the Democratic nomination. And thereby hangs a tale.
Last month, when Bill Clinton's campaign bid was suddenly engulfed by sexual scandal, comparisons with the demise of the 1988 Hart campaign were common currency. Yet the shadow now cast by Mr Hart extends well beyond the politics of sex; it has as much to do with the kind of Democratic Party that the main candidates in New Hampshire today say they wish to build. Although none of them will say so openly, they are singing Gary Hart's song.
The links between Mr Hart and today's candidates are substantial. Mr Kerrey nominated Mr Hart for the presidency at the Democrats' 1984 convention (Mr Shore, who recently re-read Mr Kerrey's speech, was surprised to find a passage in it that Mr Kerrey still uses on the stump in New Hampshire). Many of Mr Kerrey's supporters in New Hampshire are--eight years older and eight years more harassed by their kids--the same people who flocked to Mr Hart in 1984. Mr Hart gave Mr Clinton his first job in politics, organising Texas for George McGovern (whose campaign manager Mr Hart was) in 1972. And he speaks warmly of Paul Tsongas, a colleague in the Senate for six years and now yet another candidate in New Hampshire.
All three men, according to Mr Hart, are as convinced as he was that the Democratic Party has to modernise itself; that it cannot be in hock to interest groups and labour unions; that it must be as committed to the creation of wealth as to its distribution; that it cannot fool Americans that a big federal government will, at a wave of its hand, make their lives better.
CONSIDER CALIFORNIA, AND THE WORLD
Yet, in two ways, Mr Hart's themes of the 1980s have been only partly adopted in the 1990s. The first concerns a strategy for winning the White House. Mr Hart's campaign for 1988 was based on winning three states--California, Texas and Florida. This seems far-fetched; even with a Texan (Lloyd Bentsen) on the ticket, the Democrats won only 43.3% of the vote in Texas in 1988, and only 38.5% of the vote in Florida. But Mr Hart is right to stress the importance of California, where he beat Mr Mondale in the 1984 primary and where Michael Dukakis lost to George Bush by only 350,000 votes out of nearly 10m cast.
It is a reasonable bet that Mr Hart, who was popular in the state, would have beaten Mr Bush in California. With California in the bag, Democrats can imagine a majority in the electoral college; without it, even if they do well in the South, they probably cannot. Yet none of the candidates today has spent as much time thinking about what plays in California as Mr Hart did. Mr Clinton may have too poor an environmental record; Mr Kerrey's flirtation with Japan-bashing, which has done him no good in New Hampshire, would be disastrous on the Pacific coast; Mr Tsongas, is (how can this be put delicately?) a little too back-east for Californian tastes.
The second way in which Mr Hart's legacy has been only partly adopted is in foreign policy. Everyone agrees that domestic issues are the key to the 1992 election. But, like it or not, presidents spend a lot of their time acting as a sort of super-foreign-minister and a commander-in-chief. By 1984, Mr Hart had spent years turning himself into an almost self-parodying expert in military reform, and had built up a network of contacts and friends abroad that included Mikhail Gorbachev, Gianni de Michelis, now the foreign minister of Italy, and Chris Patten, now the chairman of Britain's Conservative Party.
None of the Democrats now in the race have foreign and security policy credentials anything like as strong as Mr Hart's. Mr Tsongas speaks movingly of his time as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia; Mr Clinton made a conventional-wisdom speech on foreign policy in Washington in December, Mr Kerrey one in much the same vein on February 7th (revealingly late). But none of them can demonstrate that he has thought enough about the world to know, for example, how American diplomacy should be conducted in the Middle East or with the remade Europe.
Sceptics say this may matter in the White House, but that it is irrelevant to the process of getting there. According to this conventional theory, time spent mulling over international issues would be time wasted; voters in the Democratic primaries do not want to hear about foreign policy and anyway, come November, Mr Bush's undoubted experience in the subject (coupled with his record in the Gulf war) will make him untouchable on it. Mr Hart thinks that is a counsel of despair; that for all their present concentration on domestic issues, Americans will want to know--even in a world where the Soviet threat has dissipated--how a Democrat will deploy America's now-unique diplomatic and military strength.
Not for the first time, he may be right. Mr Hart would probably have been a disappointing president--most presidents are. But in a campaign that has already borrowed so many themes from him, it may be worth listening to Mr Hart one last time."

Everyone had thought that Kiichi Miyazawa's government, now all of three months old, would last at least until the summer. Then the prime minister would probably resign after the miserable showing the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expecting in the upper-house election in late July. But nasty things are happening to Mr Miyazawa now. A corruption scandal has again touched the government; the debate on the budget has been brought to a halt by an indignant opposition; and on February 9th the ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in a by-election. The whisper now is that Mr Miyazawa may have to go much sooner, perhaps by late March.
It is all beginning to look horribly like a rerun of the events of 1989. In that year the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal, an outraged opposition and the ensuing chaos in the Diet (parliament) forced Noboru Takeshita to resign as prime minister. The embarrassing Sosuke Uno, who replaced him, lasted only a few months--partly because of a sex scandal but mainly because he took responsibility for the Liberal Democrats' loss, after 34 years, of its majority in the upper house.
The Nara seat--a stronghold of conservatism--was lost to the Liberal Democrats at that time. Since then the party has worked hard and spent money in an effort to reclaim it. All to no avail. After the poll on February 9th an infuriated local party chief lamented, ""Our efforts to realise victory have been smashed by the scandal."" He was referring to the misfortunes of Fumio Abe, an aide of Mr Miyazawa's who was arrested on January 13th for allegedly pocketing Y80m ($640,000) in bribes from a steel-frame company called Kyowa while he was a cabinet minister.
The opposition parties in Nara united under the banner of political ethics. The 47% turnout was the highest in years for a by-election. Yukisha Yoshida, a 20-year veteran of the lower house, won the seat comfortably for Rengo-no-kai (the political arm of the Japanese trade union confederation) with 51% of the vote. Nobuharu Inoki, the Liberal Democratic candidate who held the seat until 1989, managed only 37%.
The socialists (who now call themselves, at least in English, the Social Democrats) and two small centrist groups, the Democratic Socialist Party and the United Social Democratic Party, threw their weight behind Rengo's man. With no candidate of its own, the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito (""Clean Government Party"") told its 60,000 supporters in Nara to vote as they pleased; most seem to have liked the Rengo man.
Alarmingly for the Liberal Democrats, the normally bickering opposition parties are (with the exception of the Communists) doing their best to stay united. Komeito is being asked to join the front against them, and is promising not to run a candidate of its own in the next upper-house by-election, due in Miyagi on March 8th. A lower-house by-election in Gunma will follow in late March. Two more disasters for the Liberal Democrats would make life difficult indeed for Mr Miyazawa.
All the more so if the budget remains stalled in committee. The opposition started its boycott of the budget debate on February 5th when the government refused to call Mr Abe and other members of parliament implicated in the Kyowa scandal to answer questions in the Diet. The government has offered to set up an informal committee to look into the Kyowa affair. But the opposition parties want their victims to give sworn evidence in the Diet so that, if they perjured themselves, they could be jailed.
This is a tactic the opposition parties used to great effect in 1989. The ruling party had angered the opposition by using its majority to bulldoze an unpopular consumption tax through the Diet. In retaliation, the opposition had refused to debate the budget, bringing parliamentary business to a halt for over four months. In the end the government gave in on two opposition demands. Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister and the central figure in the Recruit affair, gave evidence before the Diet. And Mr Takeshita duly announced his resignation, standing down in May 1989, despite an upper-house election that was looming in July (as it is now).
There is talk of Mr Miyazawa dissolving the lower house in late March. But talk is all it is. The previous prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, also hinted at calling a snap election when the ruling party killed off his political reform bills. But the trap springs fast in Japan on political mice that try to roar. The words were barely out of Mr Kaifu's mouth when the party bosses turned him out of office. Mr Miyazawa perhaps has even less authority than the popular Mr Kaifu to decide on the timing of an election.
Such things are the say-so of Shin Kanemaru, the ageing godfather of the Liberal Democrats. Mr Kanemaru on February 13th proposed, perhaps mischievously, giving opposition parties a ""taste"" of power in coalition with the LDP after the upper-house election. He has little time for Mr Miyazawa, whom he regards as a prima donna. But last month he accepted the honorary title of vice-president of the party, to shore up Mr Miyazawa's administration. The bigwigs are clearly indicating that they will stick by Mr Miyazawa at least until the upper-house election is out of the way.
But they said that about Mr Takeshita when the Recruit scandal was creeping closer to his office. Mr Kanemaru and his henchmen may be able to buy off the opposition with bundles of money beneath the table, but they cannot silence the public prosecutor's men. The investigators have begun to probe the affairs of a firm called Sagawa Kyubin. The firm's Tokyo subsidiary is reported to have worked with the Inagawa-kai, a crime syndicate. Dubious loans and backhanders amounting to Y490 billion ($3.9 billion) are said to have been made to the firm's friends in the underworld and in politics. The names of more than 100 Diet members said to have been on the take have been leaked to newspapers.
Small fry have started to confess to the prosecutor and the police. The big names implicated in this new scandal are expected to be disclosed in March, when the public prosecutor's office starts feeding the newspapers with titbits provided by two of the company's former directors. When that happens the ruling party's most powerful men could be running for cover."

Such was the outcome of the ""long march"" begun on February 11th by Amanullah Khan and the supporters of his Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). The aim was to go from Pakistani-controlled Azad (""Free"") Kashmir across the 1949 ceasefire line into the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. By the following day the aim had failed. As Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, said: ""We cannot let Amanullah Khan lead innocent people before the Indian firing squads."" So Pakistan's own soldiers thwarted the marchers, with road blocks, tear gas and bullets, before they could reach the Indians' land mines.
Cynics will not be surprised. They argue that this is the subcontinent's usual season for synthetic discontent. They may be right. Given the internal strife, economic and political, in both countries, the alleged threat from India is a glue that binds Pakistan together--and Pakistan's supposed threat does the same for India.
Even so, it would be unfair to accuse Mr Sharif and his Indian counterpart, Narasimha Rao, of stage-managing Kashmir's drama: too much seems to have gone out of their control. It began when Pakistan's high commissioner to Delhi, Abdus Sattar, told India's Pioneer newspaper on February 2nd that Pakistan had ""the right to uphold the struggle of the people of Kashmir for self-determination through all legal means--political, moral and diplomatic."" India, he charged, was engaged ""in an illegal and immoral repression in the state of Kashmir...Pakistan stands for self-determination for the people of Kashmir"" under the UN Resolutions of 1948. Since Mr Sharif and Mr Rao had recently been talking of the need to resolve problems through dialogue, the Indian foreign office called Mr Sattar in and roundly ticked him off.
However, on February 4th Mr Sharif announced that Pakistan would the next day observe a general strike in solidarity with the Kashmiris, just as it had in the two years since the Kashmiri revolt erupted in Srinagar at the end of 1989. The Indians reacted sharply and accused Pakistan of meddling in India's ""internal affairs"".
That is when Mr Amanullah Khan, a little-known leader of the JKLF based in Pakistan, said he would defy the Indians and lead unarmed thousands of Kashmiris from Muzaffarabad, the capital of Azad Kashmir, right through the border town of Chokhoti on February 11th. This was the anniversary of the execution by India in 1984 of Maqbool Butt, the founder of the JKLF. Mindful of a similar incident in 1990, when a few hundred unarmed Kashmiris from the Pakistan side tried to march across the border, leading to the shooting of six of them by the Indian army, India promptly reinforced its border forces.
It was at this point that India did the unexpected. On February 6th J.N. Dixit, a senior official of the foreign ministry in Delhi, summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and sought their good offices to prevent the threatened march. Since India, relying on the Simla agreement of 1972, has always said the Kashmir issue should be settled bilaterally with Pakistan, this was quite a departure. Pakistan must have been delighted, but contented itself with the self-satisfied comment that India had ""internationalised the issue unnecessarily.""
The real winner is Mr Amanullah Khan. Not only is the Kashmir issue internationalised, but he has demonstrated that the JKLF enjoys great popular support. Pakistan has always preferred Kashmiri groups, such as the fundamentalist-minded Hizb ul Mujahideen, which favour (at least in public) Kashmir's accession to Pakistan. It will now have to recognise that more and more Kashmiris favour the JKLF'S belief in an independent Kashmir."

Mr.Lee, who still keeps a sharp eye on the running of Singapore from his cabinet post as ""senior minister"", has shown little patience for the democratic and civil-libertarian advice sometimes offered by westerners. In his last years as prime minister the government severely restricted the circulation of several foreign publications for behaviour that would be considered perfectly reasonable in the West.
In a constituency meeting on February 8th, Mr Lee did it again. He warned Singapore against heeding ""liberal sociologists"" who ask for a softer and less meritocratic touch in the schools. Look how badly the British have done with that kind of policy, he said, not to mention the Americans:
This is the result of 20 years of liberal education, new ideas of education, fulfilment, creativity. You never teach the child, you engage the child. You never discipline the child, you reason with him. The result is a workforce that cannot compete.
Plenty of westerners would agree with that. But Mr Lee's latest remarks are part of a more general pattern of resistance by Asian leaders to notions about democracy and individual freedoms that most people in the West take as self-evident truths. The Asian challenge to these western notions is much more interesting than communism's ever was: Asian authoritarians argue from a position of economic and social success.
Some of them sniff a plot in the West's preoccupation with civil liberties. The chief conspiracy theorist is Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, who suspects that keeping Asia down--and America's power, as embodied in the ""new world order"", up--is the real aim of western clucking over the environment and human rights. In addressing the recent summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, Dr Mahathir said the West was arrogant in believing that its system of democratic government was right for everyone. Democracy, he argued, brought a lot of misery to many people.
That idea was echoed a few days later by representatives of two weightier Asian powers. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland, Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister of Japan who is still probably his country's most powerful politician, said that, ""laudable though democracy is,"" countries that ""rush"" to it can suffer a political collapse that makes it ""more difficult to introduce market economies, and their people suffer as a result.""
Mr Takeshita was talking about Russia, and giving pretty clear backing to the line taken at Davos by China's prime minister, Li Peng. Mr Li unrepentantly said that human rights in China were not the business of outsiders. He argued that what really mattered for a country as poor as China was economic growth, which could flourish only with political and social stability.
This is the crux of the disagreement between the Asian authoritarians and western democrats. The Asians think that the economy comes first: a government's main duty is to keep the country competitive; democracy and all the rest should be thought of in terms of how well they serve economic development.
That explains why in his blast against educational relaxation Singapore's Mr Lee also attacked those who said that local companies should be encouraged at the expense of multinationals: ""Our efficiency and competitiveness will be lost."" In his hapless recent musings about America's declining work ethic, Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, was really saying that Japan could not allow itself to get into a similar fix.
Leaders who put competitiveness first rightly worry that the average Asian, when given his head, opts for the same indulgences as slack westerners. It is an ignoble but indicative example that, when Singapore relaxed film censorship last July, making available Hong Kong classics such as ""Erotic Ghost Story"", cinema attendance shot up from 1.5m in June to 2.5m in August. A fresh clamp-down in the autumn restored the figure to 1.5m by December."

Many governments dislike green campaigners, particularly those with foreign connections. Few, however, get as upset as Malaysia's government.
Last July eight foreigners chained themselves to cranes and barges loading logs in Sarawak. Bernama, the government-run news agency, described their action as ""a war against Malaysia"". Anti-logging protests, Bernama said, are ""being used to set up an international infrastructure that can attack and topple the sovereign governments of third-world nations, using the excuse of saving the environment.""
The intellectual inspiration for these salvoes comes from Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister since 1981. At January's summit meeting in Singapore of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, Dr Mahathir said groups that want to ban the trade in tropical timber are ""advocating that forest dwellers remain in the forest, eating monkeys and suffering from all kinds of diseases."" It was claimed by some that tropical forests were a common heritage of the world. ""We dispute this."" Dr Mahathir pointed out that the rich fifth of the world produces four-fifths of the greenhouse gases, and complained about the ""undue focus on the tropical forest"".
Defending the developing world against what he sees as the unreasonable demands of the rich countries is a familiar theme of Dr Mahathir's. In fact his government's policy for its remaining forests in Peninsular Malaysia seems eminently sensible. In the 11 states of the peninsula at least 32 trees 30 centimetres (12 inches) or more in diameter must be left standing on each hectare (2-1/2 acres) after it has been logged. The World Bank says this is one of the best attempts in the world to make tropical forestry sustainable.
The Mahathir government directly controls the peninsular states. It has much less influence in Sabah and Sarawak, the two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo; these states enjoy a degree of autonomy. The Borneo rain forest is the oldest in the world and possibly the most diverse; a survey of ten hectares of Sarawak's forest by the Royal Geographical Society found nearly 800 species of tree. It is this forest that provides most of Malaysia's exports of tropical logs, which account for two-thirds of the world's trade in tropical roundwood. Sabah is expected to be logged out by 1995 or so. A report by the Yokohama-based International Timber Trade Organisation, written in 1990, predicted that Sarawak would have no virgin forest left by 2001.
In both states a small group of politicians controls the timber trade. The family of James Wong, Sarawak's minister for the environment, controls some of the largest logging concessions. Whether or not the Mahathir government approves of the destruction of Sarawak's forests, it is unwilling to offend Mr Wong and his cronies, fearing that this would further dilute its control over the two eastern states.
The gloomy predictions of the greens and others look like coming true. Loli Mirai is chief of Long Leng, a Penan longhouse in north-east Sarawak. It was the Penans Dr Mahathir had in mind when he spoke about people living miserably poor lives in the forest. Mr Mirai's people are lucky to find a monkey to eat these days, because loggers have scared them away. He has been prosecuted for burning four bridges built by logging companies, and most members of his family have been detained by the police. ""But nothing has changed."" He now says it is a waste of time joining the protests."

Despite several years' warning of the deadline, some candidates were running breathlessly up the creaking stairs of the nomination office at minutes to midnight. Racing against the clock is a national trait.
They now have until election day, May llth, to decide whether they were wise to enter the contest or made a dreadful mistake. Under Philippine law a candidate can withdraw for almost any reason, including loss of confidence in one's ability to win. A substitute candidate from the same political party can take over. Substitutions can be made for all offices, from president to town councillor, until noon on polling day, five hours after voting has started.
No initial lack of confidence was apparent in any of the 78 candidates who want to be president, the 18 who will be content with the vice-presidency or the 265 who are after one of the 24 Senate seats. But this week the independent Commission on Elections disqualified all but eight of the presidential hopefuls as nuisance candidates. One of those disqualified had said that, if elected, he would free all the prisoners from Manila's jails.
Of the remaining eight, the most famous is Imelda Marcos, widow of the president who was deposed in 1986. She launched her campaign with a rally in the heartland of her husband's home territory, in Ilocos province in the north of the country, and attracted a crowd of 10,000, about as many as most candidates gather in the early stages. She is not regarded as a front-runner. Neither is Salvador ""Doy"" Laurel, the present vice-president, but he claims he and Mrs Marcos may work out a deal.
Others expected to fall behind once the campaign gets going are Jovito Salonga, until recently president of the Senate, Joseph ""Erap"" Estrada, a senator and film actor who plays good-guy roles, and Miriam Defensor Santiago, who became prominent as the corruption-busting head of the immigration bureau. Juan Ponce Enrile, who at one time seemed a likely candidate, is not now going after the presidency. He is standing for the House of Representatives and hopes to become its speaker.
The three front-runners for the presidency are Fidel Ramos, President Aquino's former defence secretary and her choice to succeed her; Eduardo ""Danding"" Cojuangco, a tycoon and former crony of Ferdinand Marcos, and, as it happens, a cousin of Mrs Aquino; and Ramon ""Monching"" Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, who claims to be pals with both Mrs Aquino and Mr Cojuangco.
In what is possibly the world's most transparent political glasshouse, the coming weeks are likely to see political realignments publicly arrived at. But in one respect at least this is not going to be the traditional Philippine election. Mrs Aquino has set politics moving in a new direction by supporting Mr Ramos, a candidate who is not a traditional politician and has no ties to any of the big parties. And he is a Protestant in a country where the Roman Catholic church claims 85% of the people.
The law that allows substitutions has given a burst of life to rumours that Mr Ramos could withdraw as late as the final day to allow Mrs Aquino to seek a second term. Mrs Aquino's staff are issuing yet more denials that she will run again. And it has to be said that, even in the unpredictable Philippines, this is one thing that will not happen.
A three-month election campaign may seem long. But it is almost obligatory for presidential candidates to spend at least one day in each of the 70 provinces of the 7,000-island archipelago, and in addition some time in most of the 70 larger towns, leaving little time even for flying visits to 1,500 medium-sized towns. Running for office in the Philippines literally means running."

Coal is the biggest culprit. It provides some 70% of China's energy, driving industry and heating the home, which means that more than 900m tonnes of it go up in smoke each year. This month, in the depth of winter, the air of Beijing and other cities is at its thickest as millions of stoves burn low-quality coal. Into China's skies go 20m tonnes of dust each year.
That is not all: 15m tonnes of sulphur dioxide also go up the chimney each year--much of it to fall to earth again as acid rain. The result is that the Guangdong-Guangxi-Sichuan-Guizhou basin has become one of the largest acid-rain zones in the world. As for the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCS) so dreaded in the developed world, China already produces 12m CFC-containing refrigerators a year--relatively few for a population of 1.1 billion, and certain to grow as households become more affluent.
Officials claim that pollution, although ""grim"", has not grown as fast as the economy. If true--and China's statistics are dubious--that is just as well. Economic growth is intrinsically polluting and China is aiming to double income per person, to about $1,000, by the end of the century. The government says it spent more than 11 billion yuan between 1986 and 1989 ($2.9 billion at 1989's official rate) on environmental protection, and will spend another 220 billion yuan over the next decade. It will not be enough, and China wants the rich countries to chip in some money too.
State-run factories are only part of the problem. ""Township enterprises"", run more or less like private firms, employing 100m people, producing about 25% of GDP, are the other. Their managers are disinclined to spend any money on controlling the toxic wastes the factories spew out.
China has admirable regulations on pollution control. But legal accountability is a little known concept in China. Most factories either bend or ignore the rules. A handkerchief factory in Qingdao that was releasing poisonous gases into the atmosphere was closed only after 10,000 local people had complained. Niu Shiru, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health and Engineering, says that factories are given help to overcome pollution. But he admits that the solution is not always permanent. ""A year passes and we're back at square one.""
Staff at the institute are blunt about the sickness that results from pollution. In Liaoning province, the heartland of China's heavy industry, death from lung diseases is four or five times higher than in developed countries. Each year some 2,000 people die in Shenyang, the provincial capital, who, statistically speaking, would not have died had they lived in a rich country. Illness and death from pollution in Shenyang are estimated to cost 177m yuan a year. In Xuanwei County, in Yunnan province, women burning poor coal in their cooking stoves die of lung cancer at the same rate as their chain-smoking menfolk.
The institute has also found that 700m people in China are dependent on polluted water. Of those, 77m people are supplied with water containing too much fluoride. An excess of fluoride can rot teeth and bones. For these people China's economic march has only a limited appeal."

It is not, however, being called by that name, because doing so would confuse it with the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, a Good Thing. This is the Islamic intifada, a Bad Thing that may already be stirring inside Algeria and is causing many Arab regimes outside Algeria to quake at the knees. Quite suddenly, from Riyadh to Rabat, fear of fundamentalism is back.
Early in January, with backing from the army, Algeria's rulers cancelled the second round of an election they knew they were going to lose. The first reaction was muted. Most of the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front, the party that would have won, had already been locked up. The party's followers seemed too amazed by the army's intervention--and by the constitutional jiggery-pokery in which it was disguised--to know how to respond. Fleetingly, the army dared to hope that it had got away with it.
Now it knows better. Last week riots and shootings broke out in the town of Batna and then spread to Algiers, Constantine and many other cities. In poor neighbourhoods of the capital, where the FIS has most of its support, young men built barricades. They threw stones and the occasional petrol bomb at policemen and troops, who shot back with live ammunition.
On February 9th the government imposed a state of emergency. Some hours later, in darkness, ambushers in the casbah raked two police cars with machinegun fire, killing six policemen. On February l3th a group of soldiers was attacked near the casbah by assailants armed with knives.
Algeria is not about to go under as Iran did. The army shows no signs at present of splintering (though some young conscripts are said to have been confined to their barracks). But the still-birth of the democratic experiment in Algeria has left the secular leaders of the Arab world floundering anew for some answer, other than repression, to the political challenge of Islam.
So far, the challenge has defied every attempt to stamp it out, except when the stamping is unspeakable. In 1982 Syria's President Hafez Assad solved his Islamic problem simply by killing 20,000 or so people in those Syrian cities, such as Hama, whose population had supported a fundamentalist uprising. Iraq's Saddam Hussein copied him, on a less bloody scale, until he discovered Islam's merits during his war with America. Tunisia and Morocco, Algeria's Maghrebi neighbours, refuse to legalise the Islamic opposition, but live in neurotic fear of it. In places where they are legal--notably Jordan and Egypt--Islamic opposition parties similar to the FIS flourish, hoovering up the protest votes of the poor, the pious or the plain fed-up.
Between repression and democracy, is there a middle way? Until the military crackdown, Algerians hoped that they had found one. Kin Hassan of Morocco, swimming in crocodile tears, described it this week in an interview with the Washington Post. Religion, he said, was not enough to run a country. Once in power, Algeria's Islamists would soon have discovered the need for sensible economic policies; and the voters would soon have understood that they had none. ""Had the Algerian elections been allowed to proceed, we would have seen [the FIS] at work.""
The hope that some Islamic party will take power and then fail, promptly and visibly, is common among Arab politicians. Only thus, it is argued, will ordinary people lose their faith in the religious quick-fix. The difficulty is that all such politicians, King Hassan included, want this didactic affair to happen in somebody else's country, not their own. When the enemy is at the gate, as in Algeria, the instinct of those inside is to slam it. Besides, one moral from just outside the Arab world is that an Islamic government may not go wrong spectacularly enough. For all its failures, and after a dozen years, Islamic Iran gives little outward sign of secular backlash. If anything, its proselytising impact on the Arab world, through sympathetic friends in Sudan and elsewhere, is on the rise.
In Egypt and Jordan neither President Hosni Mubarak nor King Hussein has been sufficiently brave or desperate to do what Algeria's Chadli Benjedid did, and give the Islamists a real shot at power. But they have done the next best thing, by letting the Muslim Brotherhood, their own more elderly version of the FIS, compete for elections to largely powerless parliaments. The unspoken idea was that, once the Brotherhood had been given a taste of responsibility, the emptiness of its Islamic slogans would become plain for all to see.
Matters have not turned out that way for King Hussein. Until recently the Islamists controlled several cabinet portfolios. Although some of their policies on educational and social matters made them look foolish, their popularity has by no means evaporated. They are bitter, open and dangerous opponents of the king's peace talks with Israel. Before pursuing the American peace initiative, the king felt it necessary to put them out of the government. But even from opposition they constrain his freedom of manoeuvre. If the talks collapse, as the Brotherhood expects them to, they will certainly profit from the failure.
Egypt's political class is blunt about Algeria. Hussein Amin, a former ambassador, believes that Algeria could no more have accepted rule by the FIS than modern Germany could accept rule by the Nazis. He says that, if Algeria had fallen to the Islamic parties, Egypt would swiftly have followed: ""The tragic thing is that no secular party has the vision to attract the imagination of the people."" But what mainly perturbs Egyptian leaders is that the Algerians may now be making a blunder, by pushing the mass of people who voted for the FIS out of a general sense of grievance into the arms of the tiny minority (see box) eager to impose Islamic rule by violent means.
AGAINST SIN
The toughest of the Algerian fundamentalists' fighting men are the Afghan veterans. Since 1986, more than 500 Algerian volunteers are said to have gone to Afghanistan by the way of Libya, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. They were trained by the mujahideen, and fought alongside them. They returned disillusioned, to an Algeria with few jobs, when the Afghan war petered out.
The ""Afghans"" are held responsible for most acts of urban guerilla warfare. These are mainly ambushes of soldiers and policeman, including the attack on February 10th when gunmen killed six policeman. But at least six other militant groups are involved. They have such fiery titles as Expiation and Sin, Exile and Redemption (which has called for a jihad, or holy war), the Armed Islamic Movement, and the Brigades of God.
On February 12th the army-backed government announced the arrest of six members of the Expiation and Sin group, including a woman, in the province of Tipaza, west of Algiers. The regime seized documents which, it claims, showed that the group had received military training and intended to set fire to food in stores and warehouses in order to cause shortages during the Ramadan fasting month, which starts in March. It also says that it found quantities of Pakistani money.
The underground groups are said to have learnt from the mistakes their members made during the demonstrations last June that were crushed by the army. They were then in the forefront of the street fighting in Algiers, and many were photographed and arrested. Now the groups appear to have become more mobile, operating in rural areas to the west and on the high plateaus south of Algiers, in small units to escape detection.
Rumours about them abound. They are said to get their money from outside as well as from local supporters, and also from smuggling and the black market. Many of their arms are said to come from Chad, by way of Niger, and from the Tuaregs in Mali. There is talk of huge thefts of dynamite. But nobody knows how well armed, or well trained, these militant groups really are.
The Egyptian regime has been careful to drive a wedge between the non-violent militants, whom it tolerates, and the small armed bands that breed on their fringes. In Algeria, however, the new government shows signs of panic. Anxious to act swiftly against the Islamic militants before the arrival of Ramadan in March, it is preparing to ban the FIS, even though, for practical purposes, the movement has already been thoroughly disrupted.
If the regime is lucky it will stop the violence from spreading. But the future looks bleak. Deprived of leaders, millions of people who believe they were robbed of their vote are now in danger of turning in desperation to the men with machineguns. If they do, it could make Algeria's intifada a good deal scarier than that uprising in the West Bank."

The special commission charged with overseeing the disposal of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction has been trying to find a way round Iraq's obstructions. Now it has lost patience. On January 28th the commission's chairman, Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, sent a report to the Security Council saying that the effort to eliminate Iraq's nastiest weapons is increasingly unproductive, and could come unstuck altogether unless the council gives the dictator's arm another wrench.
Saddam Hussein's actions are clearly contrary to Security Council Resolution 687 which Iraq accepted as a formal ceasefire. Most of the inspection teams, particularly those checking Iraq's nuclear programmes, have had to put up with interference of some sort. Far from coming clean on where their laboratories and production plants are, the Iraqis have time and again denied the existence of such installations until the UN teams, armed with intelligence from defectors or overhead reconnaissance, have asked to visit specific sites.
Iraq has repeatedly failed to provide the information required. For example, although it has offered up a quantity of chemical weapons for destruction, it has yet to account for the equipment used to manufacture eight of the ten types of the weapons found. More sinister, it is suspected of concealing an underground nuclear reactor. When asked to produce documents, the Iraqis usually claim that they were burnt in air raids. Papers that support Iraqi claims are almost always available.
Now such tactics may be changing, for the worse. Saddam Hussein is fed up with the hassle of the inspections and wants them stopped. In a mid-January meeting with UN officials the Iraqis said they would provide no more information on their plans to build weapons. On January 23rd the foreign minister, Ahmed Hussein, wrote to the Security Council asserting that Iraq had already done everything that was required by Resolution 687.
UN officials, pouring scorn on this claim, are also concerned about two follow-on resolutions, 707 and 715, neither of which Iraq has formally accepted. The first requires Iraq to allow the UN to use its own aircraft for both transport and checking (five German aircraft are now based in Iraq to support the inspection teams); the second is a plan for long-term monitoring.
Mr Hussein may bank on the UN dithering. But Security Council members believe that Iraq would rearm quickly if they took the pressure off. Pressed both by the special commission and by George Bush (whose election prospects might be improved by a new round of Saddam-bashing), the UN may surprise Iraq's leader by responding to his challenge with vigour."

For two years they have been plagued by drought. Now Robert Mugabe's government is threatening the compulsory purchase, at prices set by itself, of more than half of the land they own. Not only the farmers are jittery. So are many local businessmen, plus the World Bank and the rich countries that lend to Zimbabwe. They are afraid that the reforms will scythe down both farm exports and the confidence of investors, just when Zimbabwe needs them most.
The 60-page Land Acquisition Bill, which goes before Parliament on February 28th, gives landowners no recourse to the courts if they consider the government-set price unfair. Worse, the government intends to pay for properties over five years, in local currency. Since the foreign-exchange price of Zimbabwe dollars fell by 47% in 1991 alone, and annual inflation is around 30%, this proposal understandably fills farmers with dread. They had hoped for consultation, but are being presented with a fait accompli. Alan Burl, the president of the Commercial Farmers' Union, has been given no date for an urgent meeting he requested with a president still in mourning after the death of his wife last month.
Land inspired the peasants who fought the bitter war to turn white-ruled Rhodesia into black-ruled Zimbabwe. White settlers, arriving in their thousands after the second world war, grabbed much of the best land; public investment in roads, water and land management was almost exclusively for their benefit. As part of the deal that brought independence in 1980, the new black government therefore promised to resettle 160,000 black families on white land, but by agreement not by force.
The government now says that it is too cramped by that promise. It has bought 3.3m hectares (8.15m acres) from willing white sellers--enough to settle only about 60,000 black families. Yet the commercial farmers--about 4,500 of them, almost all white--still own ll.5m hectares, which is almost one-third of the entire country. Some 7m people, all of them black, live on 16.4m hectares of ""communal"" farmland. The government proposes to acquire another 5.5m hectares, almost half the whites' land, whether or not the owners want to sell. Mr Mugabe's ZANU-PF party holds 147 of the 150 seats in Parliament, so he can if he wishes push the new bill quickly into law without amendment.
Many foreign voices are being raised against it. One is Britain's. Since independence the British have paid L20m ($36m) towards Zimbabwe's land-resettlement programmes, which gives teeth to their view that land redistribution should, as before, be based on free negotiation between willing buyers and willing sellers. British aid might not survive a Zimbabwean decision to press ahead.
The British are not alone. In mid-February Bernard Chidzero, Zimbabwe's finance minister, will attend a meeting of the Paris Club. There his country's rich creditors will say that the land bill will undo much of the credit Mr Mugabe had earned by his wider economic reforms. Compulsory purchase of land, at arbitrary prices, is no advertisement for the investor-friendly, free-market economy Zimbabwe has told the IMF it is trying to create. The views of the Paris Club will weigh heavily on Mr Mugabe.
Yet the donor countries have also successfully pressed Mr Mugabe to go for multi-party democracy, not a one-party state. At the elections in 1995 his rivals are bound to demand land for the people. A robust programme of seizures could be a tonic for his exhausted party.
The tonic, according to the government's critics, could make agriculture wilt. Production on black farms has shot up since independence, making Zimbabwe's land reform look remarkably successful next to that of just about every other African state. Yet around 80% of Zimbabwe's commercially sold crops are still produced by the white farmers, who claim that they are more productive than the best black farms--and that their estates provide more jobs, dwellings and welfare for blacks working as labourers than the same land would with the labourers resettled as independent yeomen. The whites are especially appalled that some tobacco farms are to be taken over. Tobacco, the country's biggest export, last year brought Zimbabwe more than $500m.
Many white farmers blame their predicament on Witness Mangwende, the undeniably unsympathetic minister for agriculture. That is too simple. Mr Mugabe fought a war to redress his country's inequalities. Against his instincts, he has accepted multi-party democracy. The temptation to win votes by handing out land is strong, however high the price."

Most of its patrons are the striped-shirted set who busy themselves in central Johannesburg's tall office buildings, but no one is surprised to see the manager solicitously describing the plat du jour to a prominent member of the African National Congress. Two years and two weeks ago the ANC was still banned, its members regarded as dangerous revolutionaries. Now they eat at La Bastille. No mob is storming the prisons of the ancien regime; no tumbrils are rolling; no guillotines swishing. After decades of abnormality, South Africa is normal at last. This is the most extraordinary thing about it.
Normal countries, of course, have problems, and in this respect South Africa is super-normal. Apartheid has left it divided, not just black against white, but black against black, Xhosa against Zulu, Coloured (mixed race) against Indian, and so on. Today the old alliances and divisions are all changing. On the one hand some frightened whites, and not just Afrikaners, are taking up arms against the reforms being introduced by President F.W. de Klerk's National government. On the other inter-racial marriage is becoming almost a commonplace among young liberals, and the dinner parties of cabinet ministers may include black guests met for the first time six months ago in talks aimed at bringing peace to the townships.
For many the change is confusing. Coloureds--nearly 3m are thus classified--are reacting by joining the National Party. Though apartheid often treated them cruelly, disfranchising them in 1968 and dis-possessing them of their homes (most notoriously in District Six in Cape Town), and though the ANC has made a bid for their support (recruiting Allan Boesak, a Coloured leader), they seem to fear the black masses more than their former white oppressors. Their representatives have been defecting to the Nationalists and, to judge by the paucity of Coloured marchers in recent ANC demonstrations, their votes will go the same way.
South Africa's Indians have long been involved in politics (even before Mahatma Gandhi was forced off the pavement by a Pretoria policeman in 1893 and decided to take on the white government). In this they have differed from the Indians of East and Central Africa, who have preferred to stick to commerce. Now South Africa's Indians too are withdrawing from politics, turning instead to religion and to their own affairs. Indian organisations (closely allied to the ANC) are represented at Codesa, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, where 19 groups are trying to reach agreement on the path to a new constitution, but they speak for ever fewer people.
Coloureds and Indians know that the main players on the South African stage are the 4.5m whites and the 27m blacks. For more than 40 years the National Party has spoken for the whites, invariably defeating the only opponents it allowed to challenge it; and for even longer--it has just turned 80--the ANC has spoken for the blacks, untested in formal elections but probably with majority support.
Since Mr de Klerk took over the Nationalists in 1989, these two ancient antagonists have come not perhaps to love one another but certainly to need each other. The Nationalists can hardly revert to apartheid and repression: to do so would send South Africa up a bloody cul-de-sac. The ANC can hardly return to the armed struggle: without Soviet support it would be even less menacing than in the past. In the organisations' mutual need lies the cause for optimism.
The optimistic outlook foresees agreement at Codesa on a set of constitutional principles, which will, if the government gets its way, be endorsed by a referendum (maybe in September). The current Parliament, in which blacks are not represented, will then legislate itself out of existence, to be replaced after elections (at the end of the year?) by a new one which will bring in a new constitution. This glib timetable assumes agreement on a host of issues, some of them more awkward than the optimists like to admit. The trickiest, perhaps, is whether the Nationalists' desire for institutionalised ""power-sharing"" in the new set-up will amount to a white veto over change. That the ANC could not accept.
One case for pessimism assumes that the talks break down over this, but those inclined to gloom can find plenty of other paths to a bust-up: the ANC'S insistence on a constituent assembly (the government wants a transitional government), an inability by Mr de Klerk to carry his whites in the referendum, an egregious piece of violence, the discovery of an irrefutable link between the security forces and death squads, an assassination. The list is endless.
HOPING FOR FAILURE
Should the pessimists be proved right, extremists on both the right and the left will be delighted. On the right, unreconstructed white supremacists will, if they mean what they say, try to open talks with a view to dividing the country and thus establishing an Afrikaner homeland. On the left, they will confront a ""one settler, one bullet"" Pan Africanist Congress much strengthened by the failure of the negotiations. The PAC is already gathering support, claiming more members than the ANC, counting on the failure of Codesa and meanwhile doing little to dissociate itself from the policy of its military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, of assassinating policemen.
About 150 policemen were killed last year, some white, more black, some by political militants, more by trigger-happy criminals. Violence is the reality of everyday life, increasingly for whites as well as blacks. Chiefly, however, it is the poor who suffer. Of the 15 people who died in different incidents in South Africa last weekend, all were black; one was a six-year-old girl.
Apartheid was built on violence, by making family life a crime, by dumping people in ""homelands"" and stopping people from living and working where they would. Apartheid is gone, but the hostels for migrant workers, often Zulus, live on. Many Zulus are supporters of the Inkatha Movement led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a man who can sound sophisticated and restrained or tribal and menacing. Zulus are widely feared in the townships. In any fight involving equal numbers of Zulus and non-Zulus, the Zulus are always bound to win, says a dispirited Sowetan, reflecting on the looting and destruction of his shop in a nearby hostel; the outcome is in doubt only when the Zulus are heavily outnumbered.
One problem for President de Klerk is the need to bind Chief Buthelezi into Codesa; Inkatha is represented there, but not by its leader, who is boycotting the gathering because it is too committed, in his view, to a unitary state and will not give a special place to King Goodwill Zwelethini, the king of the Zulus. Inkatha probably has no more than 12% support among South Africa's blacks, perhaps as little as 6%; the National Party may well be more popular. But Inkatha is too potent, too well organised and too strong in Natal to be excluded.
Spear-carrying Zulus are, however, just one of the hazards of township life. A bigger one is the mass of untaught, undisciplined, unemployed and unemployable youths who, putting ""liberation before education"", boycotted schools in the 1980s to emerge in the 1990s as the tsotsis of the townships. Each year about 800,000 new job-seekers come on to the market, some who have successfully completed school, some who have not. This year, according to the Chamber of Business, only 7% of those who have matriculated can expect to find formal work.
God help the rest. They will join the thousands who each month leave the ""homelands"" where apartheid forced them to lead degraded lives on degraded lands. Now, with influx control and pass laws abolished, the cities beckon, but the reality is just another tin or plastic hovel among the thousands gathered round every city.
For the shanty-dwellers, political liberalisation, Codesa and all of that matter much less than the erosion of the rule of law--not just the ever-present violence, the tsotsis on the commuter trains from Soweto, the political thugs and the men with knives and petrol bombs and AK-47S, but the spreading disregard for authority of any kind. In many townships rents are not paid, mortgages are not met, houses are not repossessed, cars, drivers, televisions are not licensed, crimes are not investigated. Why play by the rules when everyone around you has long since given up?
This is the immediate world for most black South Africans, and therefore the one that concerns them most. For most whites, the concerns are different: what will happen to living standards, schools, the future? Amid the uncertainty, all minor worries are set aside: ""Stuff the rhino, save the white man"", as the bumper sticker puts it.
Can Mr de Klerk and the ANC'S Nelson Mandela sort this out? Not possibly. Two remarkable men may yet pull off a negotiated transition to non-racial democracy. If so, that will be an astonishing achievement, unthinkable three years ago. But South Africa's wounds are too severe to be healed by politicians alone, just as its ailments are too complicated to be described by journalists.
One example. Last month a white farmer and his son had a row about the price of cattle. The son then killed his father before going on a shooting spree at the OK shopping mall in the local town; 23 people were hit and eight of them, all black, died. It emerged that the son had never been allowed to sit at his parents' table but had had to cook his own meals on an outside fire. At the father's funeral, the son watched from a police van. Meanwhile, his half-sister, the farmer's daughter by a black tenant, sat alone in church, keeping her distance from her white relations. Her stepmother put an arm around her. The girl told reporters that her father had bought her a red bicycle for Christmas, and she loved him.
To do justice to tales like this requires the novelist's skills. How lucky at least for South Africa that it has so many good writers--Nadine Gordimer, the current holder of the Nobel literature prize, among them."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224132739/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/24?accountid=14657,"Roughly once a decade the Germans get the urge to question their economic prowess. At the start of the 1980s they moaned that foreign rivals were streaking ahead with newer technology and fresher ideas--and then resolved to catch up. Ten years and a run of record trade surpluses later, they are in a blacker mood than ever.
Unity is partly to blame. While many foreigners fret about a too-mighty Germany, the Germans themselves reel under new economic blows and bills. Record public borrowing, highish inflation, more than 3m out of work: this was not what the Germans expected unity to bring (on the rare occasions when they considered the topic at all).
Even apart from the unity strains, firms in Germany are being crippled, according to the hand-wringers, by high taxes, expensive labour and big environmental and power costs. As a result, foreign investors are shunning Germany and German bosses are moving production (and hence tens of thousands of jobs) abroad. Edzard Reuter, head of Daimler-Benz and one of the loudest groaners, gives warning that his group may be forced to start building even luxury Mercedes cars outside Germany. Heinrich Weiss, president of the Federation of German Industry, sadly reflects that Germans nowadays prefer to ""reap instead of sow"".
As the charts show, cost-cutting is one reason for German firms' foreign investment. But it is usually not the main one. Allianz, the country's biggest insurer, expanded abroad because cartel rules stopped it growing much more at home; Deutsche Bank swept into Italy and Spain the better to position itself for the single European market; Siemens (electricals) and the German chemical giants bought heavily in America to be inside markets they could not feed with exports alone. But why haven't foreigners been ploughing more money into Germany?
Not, in many cases, for lack of trying, as Pirelli's recent abortive bid for Continental, a German tyre company, showed. For all their claims to the contrary, the Germans can be as hostile to foreign buyers as the Japanese. (Like the Germans, the Japanese are huge net investors abroad, but unlike the Germans they rarely suffer from economic self-doubt.) True, plenty of foreign firms have made it to Germany and thrived, such as General Motors with its Opel subsidiary. The government is also keen to get more foreigners to put cash into the still ramshackle east. But, that apart, Germany's market is hard to penetrate and tough to stay in--though not quite as tough as the groaners say. Three issues are illustrative.
First, corporate tax rates look unbearably high, profits often piffling. But Germany's gloriously flexible accounting rules let firms bury earnings in reserves for accelerated depreciation and the like, which results in less revealed profit and a lower tax bill (a technique of which Daimler's Mr Reuter in particular is a master). That still leaves the tax burden a bit heavier than in most competitor countries, so the centre-right government of Helmut Kohl has pledged to lighten it. The bosses' squeals now are meant in part to ensure that the promise is kept.
Second, the bill industrial firms face to keep the place clean--DM21 billion ($13 billion) in 1990 alone--looks a lot higher in Germany than in most competitor countries. Hence the corporate squawks against still tougher environmental rules being mooted by the government. This is understandable. But the German car industry at first complained about government prodding to install catalytic converters, and then went on to make a packet out of them, while also picking up the biggest world market share in fuel-injection systems. Now lots of other German firms are forging into environmental technology, partly because the government is setting a hot pace but also because big market chances beckon, especially in the heavily polluted cast.
Third, German workers, who already take the world's longest holidays and are, apart from Norway's, the most expensive to employ, are treating themselves to pay rises this year probably averaging around 6%. Too high, most pundits say, even allowing for German labour's discipline, high productivity and a widely admired on-the-job training system. More rationalisation is inevitable; jobs will go. Similar chants have been heard in most years and have often proved true. But over the past decade around 1.5m more new jobs have been created than have been lost. Unrelenting pressure for more goodies from strong trade unions is one big reason why German firms have had to make themselves more efficient, pushing into new fields and higher-value products.
A nice trick if you can keep it up. Plenty of employers doubt it--citing, for one thing, the soaring costs of unity, which are pushing up prices and interest rates, and aggravating union demands. This is true for the moment, although unity means huge business chances too. Otherwise western German industry would not be investing DM36 billion ($23 billion) in the east this year alone. By the end of the 1990s, according to a recent poll of businessmen and politicians, the east will have emerged as the showcase of Germany, with more modern plant and infrastructure than the west. This view is strongly at odds with the present gloom.
Germany's competitors have grown steadily stronger in part thanks to German-type virtues: the British by cutting strikes, tlie French by reducing inflation, the Japanese by (among other things) better organisation. That means the Germans need to do more: for instance, by cutting state subsidies; by encouraging more privatisation (both the federal railways and the postal service are now on the government's list); by simplifying chronically complex regulation; and by using more efficient production methods. What are the prospects? Not bad, thanks to that corrective ten-year itch. The Germans have a habit of spurring themselves into action just when it seems they might be falling into a self-satisfied doze.
CATCH AS CATCH CAN
Slouched in the dock, brown fake-leather hat pulled down over the eyes, walking-stick wedged under an arm, Erich Mielke is at last facing justice. For more than 30 years Mr Mielke was head of the Stasi, East Germany's infamous secret police. But it is not his Stasi work that has landed this frail 84-year-old in the dock. He is being tried for two murders that took place more than 60 years ago.
In August 1931, in the violent dying days of the Weimar republic, Mr Mielke, then a 23-year-old unemployed member of the Communist Party, is alleged to have shot two Berlin police officers. Mr Mielke subsequently fled to the Soviet Union and was sentenced in absentia by a court in 1934.
The decision by the Berlin prosecutor's office to revive the old case against him, rather than try him for his Stasi activities, was tactical. Any crimes he may have committed while head of the Stasi would have to be tried under East German law and Mr Mielke would stand a good chance of walking free.
But the tactic could backfire. Evidence presented at the 1934 trial was predominantly obtained by the Gestapo after the torture and harassment of witnesses. Mr Mielke's defence lawyers also argue that the former Stasi chief is too ill to stand trial, and may even die from the strain. Mr Mielke, himself says nothing, except that he wants to go home. Because of his age and ill health, the trial is being spread out over weekly hearings lasting at most two hours.
Many ordinary east Germans welcome the trial. Until now only the ""little people"", such as border guards acting under orders, have faced the courts. But they would prefer Mr Mielke to answer for the things he did as head of the Stasi. There have been demonstrations outside the court and one of Mr Mielke's defence lawyers was attacked as he left the courtroom. Under the old communist regime the lawyer had been a judge in East Berlin, the woman who attacked him one of the people he put in prison."

And this is precisely the choice we are faced with."" Thus Gennady Burbulis, the most senior figure in the Russian government after Boris Yeltsin, on the future of the new Commonwealth of Independent States.
If that really is the choice, then the worst looks inevitable. On February 14th the leaders of the Commonwealth meet for their fourth summit in Minsk, the capital of Belorussia and of the Commonwealth. Prospects for agreement do not look good.
Earlier summits, in December and January, produced a string of declarations of intent and put off the most divisive issue: the future of the ex-Soviet army. Meanwhile, differences over what the Commonwealth is for have widened. Everyone could agree that it was a useful device for burying the Soviet Union. But it has done little to help resolve the inevitable disputes that broke our after the funeral. That is in part because Ukraine sees it as a debating forum, not a state. Now Ukraine is taking its opposition further, insisting that neither the Commonwealth nor Russia can be deemed the ""successor state"" of the old union.
Ukraine's eventual foreign-policy aim is clear: like Poland, it wants to be part of the European Community. Gaining diplomatic recognition is the first step towards this end. Disengagement from the Commonwealth must come sooner or later. Indeed, the process has begun: at a meeting of prime ministers in Moscow just before the Minsk summit, Ukraine sent a low-level delegation with no power to sign anything. So nothing was signed.
Russia's foreign policy is less clear. The EC can hardly swallow such a large and complex state. Russia's government has barely begun to think about where it fits into the world. No wonder it cannot make up its mind about the future of the Commonwealth. If Mr Burbulis is right, then Russia needs a stronger Commonwealth as an alternative to war. But other ministers--notably those in charge of the economy--are more nationalist, arguing that Russia's economic interests will suffer the more closely it is tied to the Commonwealth. As the only republic with internationally competitive exports (chiefly oil), they say, it could survive on its own. Significantly, the day after the Minsk summit Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, is to hold a separate meeting with Ukraine's president, Leonid Kravchuk.
The Central Asian states, which have long depended on subsidies from Moscow, ought to have the biggest stake in the Commonwealth. But since neither Ukraine nor Russia seems willing to continue the subsidies, their interest is diminishing. As poor Muslim states, they must decide whether to turn to Turkey and its westernised, secular Islam, or to richer, more purist-Muslim Saudi Arabia or Iran.
Beset with problems of this order, the Minsk summit may easily stumble over more practical issues. One could be the future of the army. A compromise between Russia and Ukraine over the vexed question of the Black Sea fleet now seems within reach. But the brinkmanship dislpayed by both sides augurs ill.
The Commonwealth defence ministry has suggested giving two-thirds of the former Soviet army to Russia, and dividing up the rest between the other states. However, the commander-in-chief still wants a unified army. Ukraine supports the ministry. By contrast the Kazakh president thinks that trying to divide up military assets will only lead to further conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Even a peaceful division of assets may not bring stability: Ukraine seems to be girding itself for defence against the east (Russia) rather than the west.
Economic ties are also showing strain. On February 1st Mr Kravchuk ""temporarily"" re-regulated prices in Ukraine until local anti-monopoly laws have been passed. This breaks his promise to co-ordinate economic policy. Both Ukraine and Belorussia will introduce their own currencies later this year. That will not necessarily break up the Commonwealth's internal market but it will require something like a payments union to finance trade flows. Similarly, all except Ukraine have agreed that Russia will, in effect, assume responsibility for the outstanding Soviet foreign debt. By insisting on negotiating its own share separately, Ukraine is breaking the debt accord signed with the Group of Seven big industrial countries last November.
Whether seen from Russia or Ukraine, Commonwealth is hardly the term to describe the legacy of the old Soviet Union."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224159463/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/26?accountid=14657,"Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, has revealed his spending plans for the five years starting in 1993. Strictly speaking, these proposals are the commission's, but they are known as the ""Delors package"". Mr Delors wrote some of them himself and they reflect his vision of what the Community should be doing in the 1990s, such as providing more aid to poorer members, doing better at foreign policy and helping industry.
The five-year plan aims to pay for the constitutional changes laid out in the treaty agreed on at Maastricht in December. That set the goal of a common foreign policy; Mr Delors aims to help by doubling foreign aid. The treaty called for a new ""cohesion"" fund for the EC'S four poorest members (Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain); Mr Delors proposes to double the money these four get from the ""structural funds"", which will include the cohesion fund.
Maastricht also promised fairer financing of the budget. The package cuts the share of the budget that comes from national VAT receipts from 55% to 35%. The share based on the size of a member's GDP doubles to 40%. That suits poorer members.
The EC'S liberals are less satisfied. At Maastricht France insisted on treaty chapters on industrial policy and on ""trans-European networks"", meaning telecoms, energy and transport links between member states. Mr Delors warned the European Parliament of Europe's growing weakness in high-technology industries and in research.
Hence the promise of 3.5 billion ecus ($4.5 billion) a year to help make industry more competitive. Although there will no new fund, other bits of the budget will be redirected towards industry. Some of the social fund will be spent on retraining workers in declining industries. Some of the research budget will be moved ""closer to the needs of firms,"" says Mr Delors. But in order not to offend liberals he stresses that no money will be spent on direct subsidies to companies. Money for trans-European networks, which may be spent on feasibility studies or interest-rate subsidies, provides a third chunk of Mr Delors's industnal kitty.
Is all this just window-dressing to appease the French, or is EC policy set to turn more interventionist? It is too early to tell. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, would have preferred no industrial kitty. In the event he succeeded in cutting out all reference to aid for specific industries such as cars and computers.
The commission's sums assume the adoption of plans to reform farm spending. These would leave agriculture as the single biggest budget item, though its overall share would fall to 46%. The figures also assume that EC economies enjoy an average of 2.5% economic growth for the next five years. Slower growth would mean cuts to stay within budget ceilings.
Community governments will now haggle over the package, though the final deal is unlikely to be hugely different. Britain wants a smaller rise in spending. But its main concern is to hang on to its budget rebate, worth about 3 billion ecus a year. Germany wants that rebate trimmed. With a British election in the offing, Mr Delors has kept his counsel.
Some commissioners heard about parts of the package only days before they had to approve it, and felt bounced. When Mr Delors's officials suggested doubling the structural funds to be spent on France's overseas departments, others were so flabbergasted that they lacked the strength to say no. In Guadeloupe and Martinique the rum punch will be flowing.
ENDLESSLY ELASTIC ARRANGEMENT
The European Economic Area (EEA) is to be a frontier-free zone linking the 12 members of the European Community with the seven of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Last December it appeared to be still-born. After scrutinising the draft treaty, the European Court of justice said it would not do. The Luxembourg judges complained that a planned EEA court would infringe their autonomy. Now a deal may have been devised to revive the treaty.
The 17 countries concerned are close to an agreement that would satisfy the European Court by scrapping the rival EEA body. The EFTA countries find the loss hard to bear: they had agreed to a weak role in shaping new EEA laws in return for having a special court to interpret them, in which their judges would have had some voice.
Disputes will now be settled in three ways. Competition cases involving companies from both the EC and EFTA Will be handled by the European Commission, with the Luxembourg judges having the final say. The EFTA authorities will deal only with purely EFTA cases.
Arguments over the working of the EEA Will go to arbitration. For instance, if EFTA imposed ""safeguard measures"" against EC exports, and the Community responded with counter-measures, EFTA could appeal to arbitrators if it thought them unreasonable.
Only the European Court will rule on the interpretation of EEA laws. EFTA courts will give their ""best endeavours"" to accept such rulings. Where they do not, different rules could apply in the Community and in EFTA. If this bothered the Community, it could take counter-measures or suspend bits of the agreement.
In the event of such a suspension the Swiss want arbitrators brought in, whereas the Community does not. The Swiss are allergic to the idea of foreign judges telling them what to do. If they can be satisfied, and if all countries and the European Parliament ratify it, the treaty should come into force in January 1993.
The revolt of the Luxembourg judges has caused great embarrassment to the commission, which acted for the Community throughout the talks. Last November, three days before the EEA treaty was due to be initialled, the court wrote to the commission saying that it had objections. Why had the commission not checked the court's views in advance?
The commission ignored many signs that trouble was brewing. As early as March the European Court told the commission and the council that it had worries about the EEA. But when EFTA diplomats asked the commission's foreign-affairs directorate and its legal service, who together handled the talks, if the European Court could cause problems, they were told not to worry. In May both sides agreed to an EEA court. The commission sent the Luxembourg judges draft texts in July. It claims that the court's Danish president gave informal advice that was much less critical of the EEA than the official opinion that followed in December.
Now the commission's top officials are busily trying to pass the buck. One tries to blame the ""ayatollahs of Luxembourg"" for the mess. Others say Frans Andriessen, the commissioner in charge of the talks, should take the rap. His negotiators point out that on legal matters they followed the advice of the legal service, whose chief, Jean-Louis Dewost, reports directly to the commission president, Jacques Delors.
One effect of the affair has been to boost debate within EFTA on the merits of EC membership. Austria and Sweden, which have already applied for it, and Finland, which is about to do so, are not much bothered by an enfeebled EEA: they see it chiefly as an ante-room. Switzerland and Norway had half-hoped it might prove a substitute for membership. Now they are wondering if they would not do better within the EC, with their own ministers--and judges--to hand."

A clear and direct Soviet challenge was met by a firm and co-ordinated response from the west.
If one thing symbolised the military change in Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, it was the use of NATO'S planners, troops and aircraft for a different sort of airlift, this time to ferry western food and medicines to the beleaguered ex-Soviet Union.
For more than 40 years the perceived danger to Western Europe from the Soviet Union gave a welcome simplicity of aim to the West's military alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Its job was to meet a geographically defined and politically unquestioned threat.
That is now gone. In 1989-91 the biggest peacetime confrontation ever between two standing armies came to a sudden and unexpected end. All units of the once mighty Soviet army left Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Those still in eastern Germany, Poland and the Baltic states are meant to be out by 1994 at the latest, and it is far from sure that there will be a single army for them to return to.
In August-December 1991 the Soviet Union itself went from superpower to super-pauper and then broke up. On December 25th 1991 the Red Flag over the Kremlin was drawn down, marking the end of the Soviet Union, five days before its 69th anniversary. The Soviet Union's successor, the Commonwealth of Independent States, may not hold together long enough for the debris to settle.
This great upheaval is both welcome and disturbing. Europe now faces a new version of the ""Eastern Question"" that defeated 19th-century diplomats: how could the western powers peacefully manage the break-up of the dynastic empires to their east--Russia, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey?
GIRDING AS FOR WAR
When Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin met at Yalta in 1945 to sketch out a future Europe, they agreed that there would be a single Germany (divided temporarily into occupation zones) and that free elections should in time be held both there and throughout liberated Europe. The Big Three's strained friendship, however, did not survive the peace. Stalin broke his bargain about elections in Eastern Europe. Each side accused the other of threats and provocation. The chance of uniting Germany soon vanished. In a famous speech in 1947, Churchill pictured an ""iron curtain"" dividing the continent. Two years later, Europe was organising itself into hostile camps.
At the founding of NATO in 1949, few western leaders could have guessed that they were embarking upon an alliance of such scope, duration and success. By binding the United States to the defence of Western Europe, the Atlantic alliance contained Soviet ambitions there. Together with the Western European Union, it provided a reassuring framework for West German rearmament as well as the protection that West Germany needed for its new democracy to prosper.
The alliance's loftier purpose was to encourage the full application of Yalta's twin promise--democracy and independence--in the East. NATO'S more down-to-earth goal was to make sure that a well-defended Western Europe could prosper in peace.
Glue for this unprecedented alliance was in ample supply from the Soviet Union--and not just while Stalin was alive. First, Soviet thuggery towards troublesome neighbours continued right up to the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the pummelling of Poland's Solidarity in 1980-81 (administered by loyal Polish communists at Soviet request).
Second, whether Soviet aims were aggressive or not (a point much disputed in the west), NATO judged, it necessary to counter Soviet might, just in case. In East Germany alone, the Soviet Union at one Point kept 420,000 men and 6,600 tanks (more than twice as much armour as France and Britain together had).
Both sides in the cold war saw an interest, all the same, in slowing down the nuclear-arms race and, where possible, limiting the zones of conflict between them in the world. Times of chill alternated with periods of detente. One of these led to the creation in 1975 of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
One important CSCE principle--that borders could not be changed by force--reassured the Soviet Union that its sphere of influence was secure (at least from without). The CSCE commitment to human rights gave western governments (and eastern dissidents) a useful, if limited, wedge for prying open communist societies.
NATO had problems. As Western Europe's wealth and self-confidence grew, American dominance was bound to rankle. France's withdrawal in 1966 from NATO'S military command (though not from the alliance itself) was an extreme solution to a widely recognised problem: the alliance was not well balanced.
Europeans asked for more say about their own security; the Americans prodded them to spend more money on it. Many Europeans felt uneasy about relying on America's nuclear umbrella.
West Germans especially worried about having nuclear weapons on their soil. Deployment in the early 1980S of medium-range American missiles to counter Soviet ones aimed at Western Europe was done with the backing of the West German government, but in the teeth of widespread protests. The West Germans were also keener than some of their NATO partners to widen contacts with East Germany and the Soviet Union, come what may.
Improvising for peace NATO outlived rather than resolved these questions. For in 1985 the actions of a remarkable Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, began to destroy the political framework within which they had been posed.
In 1988 he agreed to scrap the offending medium-range missiles and for the first time accepted the idea of on-the-spot checks by the other side's disarmament inspectors. He agreed with the Americans to cut the numbers of strategic nuclear weapons and with the NATO allies as a group to give up the Soviet Union's heavy numerical superiority in most categories of non-nuclear weaponry.
Then he stood by (whether impotently or encouragingly, historians will long argue) as Eastern Europe took its freedom. In 1990 he abandoned the principle behind four decades of Soviet policy towards Germany--divided if possible; neutral when united--and accepted one Germany in NATO.
The end of the cold war led to much talk in some European capitals--and not only in the East--of a ""new security architecture"" for Europe, based on the CSCE. This, argued Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, might before long absorb NATO itself. In the CSCE America is one among what were 35 equals (the number is rising as ex-Soviet states apply to join). In NATO America gets the last word. At least for Mr Genscher, the implication seemed to be that America's pre-eminence in Europe was over.
But grand designs need solid foundations and structural supports. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the metaphor had to change. Instead of an architect of new security structures, what ex-communist Europe needed was a survey of the rubble and then urgent help for the survivors. In this, the IMF, the World Bank, the G7 club of rich economics, as well as the EC and NATO, all have a part.
NATO'S immediate future, then, is no longer questioned. Neither the EC nor the CSCE looks a likely vehicle for a European defence policy in the near future. The Gulf war in 1991 reminded European governments of the benefits of close military integration with a powerful ally. Simply by being there, NATO provided welcome reassurance to West and East at a time of rapid change. One of Russia's first acts as successor state to the old Soviet Union was to ask to join NATO, taking its place in the queue behind Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, its former allies in the defunct Warsaw Pact.
Yet, if NATO'S existence looks secure, its military job is less clear. The front line in Central Europe has gone. By the mid-1990s there could be well under 100,000 American troops in Europe (compared with more than three times that number in 1989). These may be in smaller, multinational forces.
NATO'S generals must now plan for something they dread perhaps more even than the actual enemy: uncertainty. in future, NATO'S remaining soldiers can expect to do their fighting, if at all, less in defence of NATO territory than in defence of western interests in the wider world. It would be foolish to think that military threats to Europe had disappeared. The trouble is identifying them.
SOFT THREATS
Security does not rest on force alone, or even the threat of force. Attacking the sources of conflict plays a big part. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, for example, has created security challenges that will need diplomatic skill more than military prowess. These include:
* Winding down its nuclear-weapons industry and preventing skills, technologies and the warheads themselves failing into unsafe hands.
* Ensuring that arms-control agreements are upheld.
* Preventing the successor states of the Soviet Union from starting an arms race with each other. * Converting a massive conventional defence industry to civilian uses.
Europe's starkest security problem involves not only the countries of the ex-Soviet Union but their East European neighbours as well. This is the economic gap between the two halves of the continent. Unless the economics of the East start to improve soon, three dangers will grow: threats to democracy, risks of ethnic conflict and unwanted pressure from easterners to settle in the west. For the foreseeable future, the keystone to Europe's security is economic recovery in the East.
Western Europe's first weapon in this battle is advice: on trade, from the EC; on military reorganisation, from NATO, channelled through its new Cooperation Council; on the mechanics of constitutional democracy and on the protection of human rights, from the Council of Europe; on civilian control of the defence establishment, from the North Atlantic Assembly; on confidence-building among states, from the CSCE.
Of these, the European Community is likely to be the most authoritative. It is the economic club that all of Europe's newcomers aspire to join. The EC can set standards of democracy and economic openness that the states and statelets of Europe's east cannot ignore.
The CSCE should by no means be written off. Its job is already being enlarged to include giving early warning of potential conflicts, improving crisis management an developing military confidence-building mechanisms, so as to avert tensions among the newly independent states of the old Soviet empire.
One snag is the CSCE'S ""consensus rule"": decisions must be unanimous, which means each government has a veto. That rule, however, is already being bent in small ways. Where there is concern over human-rights violations within a member country, agreement of all is no longer needed to call into play CSCE investigators or mediators.
FOUR NEW QUESTIONS
Most Europeans would reckon that their continent today was a safer place than, say, ten years ago. They would be right. The single, awful threat of war between nuclear-armed superpowers has all but gone. Yet the peace and security Europeans have come to expect lies not just in avoiding atomic destruction.
In 1945-90 Western Europe enjoyed four advantages that helped it grow and stay rich. One was the political harmony between West Germany and its former European enemies that underlay the success of the European Community. A second was an eastem hinterland frozen in communist immobility; it had to be defended against, but otherwise not greatly worried about. The third was membership in a coherent group of nations--the West--united not just by economic and political ties but by possession of a common enemy. The fourth was the friendship of the United States.
On each count, a question must now be raised. Will German unity undo the political balance in Western Europe? Can the break-up of a vast eastem empire be handied peacefully? Will the West, as a cohesive group of like-minded nations, survive the loss of its common enemy? Will Europe and America remain such staunch allies? Europes place in the world will be looked at in the last Schools Brief on Europe in next week's issue.
EUROPE'S SECURITY CLUBS
The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) is a grouping of close to 50 nations (all European states, including countries of the ex-Soviet Union, as well as the United States and Canada). It was set up to foster East-West contacts in three areas: security, human rights and trade. In 1990, besides agreeing to hold more summits and ministerial meetings, it added a small secretariat in Prague, a conflict-prevention centre in Vienna, an elections office in Warsaw and a parliamentary assembly.
Members of the Council of Europe sign up for the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Its human-rights commission and court can (and often do) declare governments in breach of their obligations. The Council, based in Strasbourg, also deals with health, migration, law, education, culture and the environment. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland are full members; other easterners have special guest status in the assembly.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is a collective defence pact of 14 European nations, plus the United States and Canada. NATO'S integrated military structure combines members' armies for both conventional and nuclear tasks under an American commander. In 1991 the North Atlantic Co-operation Council was set up to improve dialogue between NATO and the new states to the east.
The North Atlantic Assembly is the parliamentary forum of the Atlantic alliance. The eastern states have associate delegate status and participate in committees, which try to impart western experience of civil-military relations, defence conversion and related problems.
The Westem European Union was set up in part to help integrate a re-armed West Germany into westem defence planning. A collective defence organisation of nine members--all Europeans--its new job will be as a defence link between NATO and the EC."

Over the next few weeks he can expect little help from the economy, try as he may to arrange some. Figures released on February 13th showed a 53,000 rise in unemployment, to 2.6m. That was considerably worse than expected and on this measure, at least, there is even worse to come. If, after all, Mr Lamont pulls an election winner from his battered red box, it will be all his own work.
At such times, you might think, the balance between politics and economics moves decisively in the direction of bribery: the question is, simply, how much can the chancellor ""give away"" in tax cuts? If only, Mr Lamont must think, the task were really so simple. It is not. In Britain the gap between the politics and the economics of budget-making has narrowed almost to nothing, partly because of the way this unexpectedly brutal recession has come about.
Although it may fail to console the chancellor, history will absolve not merely his budget-making, but also that of his two predecessors, John Major and Nigel Lawson, of most of the blame for the boom of the late 1980s and the bust of the early 1990s. These events had little to do with fiscal policy. Their main cause was the radical deregulation of British banks and building societies, which began in 1979 with the abolition of exchange controls. That necessary reform prompted a series of changes that led to the explosion of lending by banks and building societies in the mid-1980s.
The housing market has been at the centre of the story, for much of that expansion in lending fuelled a startling rise in house prices. When inflation began to rise too, and interest rates were sharply raised to check it in 1988, over-borrowed house buyers were given the fright of their lives. Borrowing shrank and house prices fell. People began to save more and spend less: hence the fall in demand, hence an unusually stubborn downturn. Indices of leading economic indicators have been predicting recovery for months (see chart), but there is no clear sign of it yet. (Chart omitted)
In this recession more than in any other of recent years, consumer confidence, personal debt and the housing market are therefore decisive. The Bank of England's carefully downbeat Quarterly Bulletin, published on February 11th, notes that recent surveys point to a setback in consumer confidence, a continuing upward trend in the ratio of personal savings to incomes, and ""no sign of revival"" in the housing market.
That, together with Britain's commitment to defend the pound within the European exchange-rate mechanism, is why Mr Lamont has so little freedom to present an overtly ""political"" budget. If ostentatious tax cuts alarm the City, the chancellor may be forced to raise interest rates again before the election. That could stifle any revival in the housing market and further delay the general recovery. Instead, Mr Lamont's aim is undoubtedly to push interest rates lower soon, and to consolidate that cut with a budget that is judged to be prudent by the markets. This time, an economically cautious budget makes good political sense.
On the City's reading of the arithmetic, the chancellor can afford to cut taxes by roughly L2 billion ($3.6 billion); that would imply public borrowing of nearly (20 billion (or 3% Of GDP) in 1992-93, deemed acceptable in such a sluggish economy. Whitehall emissaries are currently lunching the City, in the traditional pre-budget attempt to talk up forecasts of public borrowing, so that the more modestly excessive figure, when announced, comes as a nice surprise. With L2 billion Mr Lamont could cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, or raise personal allowances and thresholds by much more than the rate of inflation.
A question for the future is whether the government's implausible promise to ""balance the budget over the course of the cycle"" will now have to be rethought. With interest rates devoted to pegging the pound, the case for greater fiscal activism is clear: the government needs an extra instrument of economic policy to manage domestic demand.
The question is how to use fiscal policy in this way without tampering each year with the structure of the tax system, or making changes that may be hard to reverse later. In a small way, this avowedly non-fine-tuning government has pioneered one such expressly temporary tax cut: the suspension of stamp duty on house sales. More such ways of changing taxes temporarily may be needed if Britain adopts the single European currency and surrenders its monetary policy altogether."

Yet this time the tabloids have behaved more like mice than rats. Since the story came out neither Paddy Ashdown (the leader of the Liberal Democrats) nor his unfortunate ex-lover has been subjected to boot-in-door treatment. This new decency is not the result of collective conscience-pangs. Fear and self-interest are the causes. Yet, though the silly papers are now behaving more seriously, some of the serious papers are getting increasingly silly.
The boisterous days of the 1980s, when an actor, Gorden Kaye, suffering from brain damage, had his hospital room invaded by journalists, and the captain of a capsized Channel ferry had microphones put in his car, are gone. Apart from the tale of the Labour MP Clare Short, her ex-criminal ex-friend and her nightie (a daring expose by the News of the World that brought it some flak from the Press Complaints Commission, the PCC), there has been little to offend tabloid-watchers over the past year.
The number of complaints from readers has been dropping. The PCC, established a year ago, got 714 in the first six months of last year, around 100 less than the old Press Council got in the same period of 1990. However, that is not necessarily a measure of anything much: one complainer said he was receiving messages from aliens, another that the papers had failed to report the contribution made by his peace plan to events in Eastern Europe. As Lord McGregor, the chairman of the commission, argues, what matters is the amount of really bad behaviour; and that has decreased. According to Patsy Chapman, the editor of the News of the World, ""we're all much more careful"".
Journalists' manners are improving a little, too. Ms Chapman's reporters are required to put a note through the door before they try inserting their foot into it. Editors are a bit more thoughtful about the stories they pursue. Ms Chapman says that ""if there's a story about an elderly vicar who has had an affair, we might ask ourselves whether that's really the worst thing anybody can do"". Politicians, though, remain fair game. The only reason that most of the juicy scandals on the Westminster rumour-mill do not get printed is that nobody has the evidence to stand them up.
The threat of legislation to curb the papers' excesses is one reason for their circumspection. The PCC was set up after the inquiry by the Calcutt committee into privacy and the press. Newspapers were given 18 months from January last year to clean up their act. If they failed, a law would be introduced to restrict their freedom to invade people's privacy.
After a year of fairly good behaviour, the threat of legislation has receded. The prime minister, John Major, has expressed reservations about restricting the press. The Labour Party, once ambivalent, seems to be coming down against legislation. Mr Ashdown, who showed his willingness to use the law to gag the papers by taking out injunctions against them last week, has nevertheless said he would vote against a privacy law.
If the threat is lifted, will the papers go back to their bad old ways? Possibly not. There is some evidence that more extreme behaviour turns readers off--as when the Sun lost 200,000 readers after its insensitive coverage of the Hillsborouh football stadium disaster. And the scale of libel damages argues for caution: Jeffrey Archer won L500,000 ($900,000) from the Daily Star, Elton John L1m from the Sun.
It is possible, too, that the way the PCC works may be having some effect. Editors have committed themselves to follow its code of conduct, and both Ms Chapman and Brian Hitchen of the Daily Star sit on the commission. The PCC also deals with complaints quickly, and newspapers that are criticised have to publish its findings: giving a whole page of her paper to the nightie adjudication really rankled with Ms Chapman.
Yet, though the prurience of the papers may be in check, their political bias is coming to the fore. As the election approaches, all papers are becoming more political. Labour obviously loses out: 12 national newspapers broadly support the Tories, five the Labour Party, and four are somewhere in the middle. The statistic so often cited to prove that this has no bearing on people's votes--that 48% of Sun readers vote Labour, and 39% Tory--argues, if anything, the opposite. From their social class, Sun voters should be much more heavily Labour.
Tabloids tend to be more politically strident but the ""quality"" Tory press is getting less lofty, too. In the past couple of weeks the Sunday Times has turned up the volume of its hostility to Labour. Its story of Neil Kinnock's rather dull meetings with people at the Soviet embassy was splashed as ""Official: Kinnock's Kremlin Connection"", and was followed by a passionate leading article raging against Labour's accusations of bias in the story. ""The Sunday Times"", readers were no doubt relieved to hear, ""will not be intimidated"". It promises more revelations that will be ""fascinating and damaging"". Unfortunately, they will centre ""solely on his politics"": no sex, please, we're a quality newspaper."

Seasoned observers expect the channel to be a flop; they argue that since satellite television already reaches 2m homes, there will be no demand for an extra terrestrial channel.
Channel-5 was invented by a government committee, which found that some spare frequencies in the middle of the UHF spectrum were being used by airport radars, radio astronomers and theatre microphones. These have been moved to other frequencies to create room for a fifth television channel. However, there are snags.
First, the spare frequencies are widely used by video recorders in their playback mode; so most videos will have to be professionally retuned before Channel-5 starts transmissions. Second, a new aerial fixed at right-angles to the normal aerial will be needed before a home can pick up the channel. Third, because of the threat of interference from French, Dutch and Irish stations, the channel will not reach a quarter of all viewers, including millions who live south of London.
The winner of the auction will have to meet the costs of retuning videos (L25m-50m), of setting up a new transmission network (L30m), of persuading viewers to fork out L50 apiece for a new aerial, and of losing money for at least three years. Yet the lucky company will still have to meet the quality requirements imposed on the other channels, on matters such as educational and religious broadcasting.
An economic consultancy, NERA, reckons that Channel-5, which is due to start in 1994, will be lucky to scrape into profit by 1997. It also predicts that the only way a franchise-holder could make money would be to find a ""niche"" audience, perhaps through a chain of city stations covering local news or sports.
The Independent Television Commission has recognised the risks and has now modified the rules. Channel-5 will not be obliged to pay any levy to the Treasury on its revenue, as Channel-3 stations do; so, if the cash bids are low, the government will make little or no money. The ITC has also agreed to make the quality requirements less strict in the first five years of the franchise.
Undaunted by the problems, four consortia are now lining up to make bids. Three of them are vaunting their regional bases: Channel s (Edinburgh), Channel x (Glasgow) and Northern Industrial Productions (Sheffield). The front-runner, Five-TV, will probably be centered on London.
Some have original technical ideas. Channel s would back up its transmission with a satellite service that would reach the areas ground-based output could not reach, including much of Europe; so it could be received by a dish as well as by a new conventional aerial. Northern Industrial Productions would limit its up-market output to a subscription service it expects to reach 10% of viewers at a cost of L8 a month. Five-TV would provide a 24-hour channel.
None of the bidders is likely to offer a niche service. All have rejected the idea of a chain of ""city stations"", although Five-TV would offer two hours of local programmes a day. Most are hoping to offer a mass-market service. The Northern group says it hopes to imitate BBC-1; Channel x says it would produce ""fresh, youthful"" entertainment with good dramas and soaps; Channel s would make a feature of repeats of programmes from other channels. So, if Channel-5 succeeds, it will be because of its similarity to BBC-1 and Channel-3, not its difference from them. A depressing thought."

But these days much of their jollity has gone. London's art trade is struggling. Sales at Christie's and Sotheby's, London's biggest auction houses (although the latter is now American-owned), have halved in the past year. And now London faces a bigger threat.
To prepare for the European single market, the European Commission is considering proposals that would remove the advantages which help London remain the leading market for art in the EC. Bosses from London's top auction houses and art dealers hope to meet Tim Renton, the arts minister, soon to discuss the problem.
London's pre-eminence is undisputed. Its auction houses and dealers account for two-thirds of all EC art sales. About three-quarters of the art sold at London auctions, particularly paintings, is imported. Many works are then shipped back out to grace the walls of Italian villas or American investment banks.
But that dominance depends heavily on an unrestricted art trade. Britain does not charge VAT on imports of works of art, unlike France or Italy. It charges VAT only on the auctioneer's commission, or the art dealer's margin, not on the full price. Nor do British traders have to pay a royalty, known as droit de suite, to the artist (or the heirs of deceased modern artists) each time a painting is sold. And Britain's export regime, including its system for protecting ""national treasures"", is one of the least restrictive in Europe.
However, from 1993 all EC countries will abolish VAT on intra-EC art trade. And the European Commission is considering three other changes that could hurt London:
* FREE MOVEMENT. Because art, like other goods, will be freely tradable from 1993, some Mediterranean countries worry that their artistic gems will be up for grabs. A recent EC directive proposes that any ""national treasure"" sold illegally after 1993 should be repatriated, and compensation paid to any innocent buyer. This promises not only a legal tangle; it could also chase some sales out of the EC altogether.
The commission has proposed a regulation to control valuable art flowing out of the EC: any work worth more than a specified value in each category would need an export licence. This proposal would hit Britain's traders hard, because so many of their sales, notably pre-19th century oil paintings, would need such a licence. The auction houses fear a bureaucratic nightmare.
* Tax harmonisation. Brussels is still debating whether VAT should be charged on the full sale price, even though the EC would lose trade to New York and Geneva if it was. But any harmonisation would be bad for London. If VAT was charged only on commission throughout the Community, London would still lose its advantage. Another potential blow awaits in a proposal to apply VAT to exports out of the Community.
* Artist's royalty. Countries that pay this, notably Germany, think royalties should be compulsory across the EC. If this idea is accepted, it could put up prices quite a bit: when French auctioneers sold Picasso's Les Noces de Pierrette, the 3% royalty to the artist's heirs was worth FFr9m (L0.9m).
The auction houses are not despondent. ""One doesn't like to be smug,"" says Anthony Browne, head of Christie's Europe, ""but producing a glamorous sale takes a critical mass of reputation, tradition and expertise"". But London's traders cannot afford complacency. French auction houses, such as Ader Tajan in Paris, are determined to win back the trade in French art, especially in pictures, that now takes place in London. They may do so, since the French government is considering a reform of France's auction profession, a bastion of restrictive practices.
Besides, today's art markets are global: satellites can link foreign bidders to salesrooms. There are fewer reasons why Madrid and Berlin, as well as Paris, should not rival London. London's art traders themselves are increasingly moving abroad. Colnagi, a big London dealer, opens its first Paris gallery this summer. Christie's and Sotheby's have both recently set up in Berlin. Phillips, another big dealer, expects to sell more outside than inside Britain for the first time this year. None of this offers much cheer to London's striped-shirt set."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224170932/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/33?accountid=14657,"Here is a subversive thought for any British voter intending soon to award the Conservative Party a cross for good behaviour: do you know whom you are voting for? Is it John Major with his engaging grin and sheaf of reassuring charters? Or will the party's oomph and vision in the mid-1990s be coming from an entirely different source?
Michael Heseltine is far too canny a politician to welcome the mutterings of some colleagues that he is the greatest of them all. He likes being back in office after the wilderness years and he knows he could lose it all through the destructive power of colleagues' jealousy. So these days cheerful flattery provokes a flash of alarm across the famous face.
Yet the mutterings are there for those who care to listen. "" He's absolutely romping"", says one cabinet minister. Another calls him in effect the deputy prime minister, and says he wins all his inter-departmental battles. An MP working in a rival team adds: ""If you ask who in our great party has the intellectual force and executive ability to stand up against Michael these days, I have to say there is nobody. You see Major being the good, reasonable chairman and Chris Patten beside him. But behind them both is Heseltine, just getting on with it.""
The poll-tax fix is the greatest achievement of the environment department since the fall of Mrs Thatcher, and there are plenty of ministers queueing up to share the credit. But Mr Heseltine was central to the fix; without his determination to abolish the tax back in November 1990, its death would have been more lingering. The final batch of poll-tax bills may yet lose the election for the Tories; but, whoever got the blame for that, it could hardly be Mr Heseltine.
Beyond that, he has thrown himself into his old enthusiasms. His victory over the Department of Transport last autumn about the route for the Channel tunnel rail-link paved the way for his dream of a huge new ""linear city"" growing towards the mouth of the Thames. Among the outfits probably going east is his own department; the crumbling brutalist towers it inhabits at Westminster are to be torn down, he announced last week. Its 3,000 bureaucrats expect to be sent to a new ""Heselgrad"" springing up out of the mudflats. If London's eastern development goes ahead as Mr Heseltine would like, it will be an act of gigantic, decade-long interventionism, a concrete reproach to Thatcherite tradition. This is a battle yet to be won; but, since Mr Major was personally involved in the rail-link choice, Mr Heseltine has government's biggest gun pointing the right way.
A range of other old Heseltine wheezes are taking shape in the policy machine. Remember the elected mayors he wanted for local councils? A consultation process has just ended and this must be a good bet for the Tory manifesto. Recall his ideas for the reform of local government, to provide single-tier, all-purpose authorities, based on the great Victorian cities and the historic shire counties? The bill to form a commission to bring this about is grinding through the Commons. Its guidelines make it clear that the authorities could be of any size, but must be based on local loyalties.
Mr Heseltine was perhaps best-known for his messianic belief in inner-city regeneration. Back in office, he has tilted the way the L1.3 billion ($2.3 billion) local authority capital programme is allocated, to give him more discretion to encourage the best projects. Last year a L350m programme to improve the worst council estates was relaunched. His ""city challenge"" programme offered a pot of money (L82.5m last year, more this year) to councils that came up with imaginative schemes for tackling decaying neighbourhoods. Among the recipients are Nottingham, where Mr Heseltine will sign an agreement next week, Liverpool, Manchester and Tower Hamlets. The second round will be launched in London by (yes) Mr Heseltine next week.
This hyperactivity has winged him across departmental boundaries. The Welsh Office, which now has control of the principality's training and education, including the University of Wales, says Mr Heseltine can take much of the credit. A Home Office man says that Mr Heseltine has done more for inner-city crime prevention than his own department has. Ideological opposites at the industry department admire his energy and talent. And in the new mood of open cabinet debate it is Mr Heseltine who often dominates. He was long ago chosen as one of the Tories' top three general election campaigners.
One should not go overboard. Mr Heseltine's fervent pro-Europeanism is still regarded with deep suspicion by most Tory backbenchers. Although he probably covets the Treasury or the Department of Trade and Industry if the Tories win, it is unlikely that the current chancellor, Norman Lamont, would be shifted. And Mr Major was genuinely angry when stories appeared last year suggesting that he would give Mr Heseltine the DTI. The prime minister would not be human if he was not faintly suspicious of his amiable colleague. Mr Major has made it clear that he believes he could stay on as opposition leader if the Tories lost; but plenty of his MPs disagree.
The Hezza-ing of government is not just a ""who's up, who's down?"" story. Mr Heseltine has a vision of an England that may influence politics for the next decade. It is a strange mix of modernisation, led by central government, and an almost Edwardian nostalgia. The nostalgia is sometimes echoed by Mr Major, the cricket-romantic who believes in good, old-fashioned values of public service and would like British Rail to be privatised in traditional regional companies (an argument that continues, and may prevent the publication of a privatisation white paper, as promised, before the election).
In a government led by Mr Major but dominated by Mr Heseltine, a mild English nationalism would be in the ascendant--particularly if Scotland went its own way. In caricature, mutton-chopped mayors would stand proudly in their marble city halls while, in the distance, chocolate-and-gold railway engines chuffed through the revived English counties. It is easy mock, but politics is, after all, partly about selling dreams. And in a cabinet that sometimes seems unsure about why it wants power, a tall fellow, just in from the cold, stands out."

Yet it has now gained surprising currency in the United States. A campaign is being led by the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank run by Clyde Prestowitz, formerly of the commerce department and now an ideas man for Bob Kerrey, a Democratic presidential candidate. During President Bush's ill-starred visit to Japan in January, Mr Prestowitz rushed out an interim report entitled ""The Case for Saving the Big Three."" A full report is due next month. Now Forbes magazine has rallied to Mr Prestowitz's support. In its February 17th issue this self-styled ""capitalists' tool"" decided that Detroit's capitalists need more tools than others, in an article entitled ""The Case for Protection.""
Leave to one side the important question of whether protection would, in fact, help America's car industry become leaner, fitter and more competitive. The case that help of some sort is needed is worth examining, particularly as it comes from such a widely cited figure as Mr Prestowitz, who led many of America's trade talks with Japan in the mid-1980s and may return to government if a Democrat is elected as president. His institute's report is the most comprehensive yet on the issue.
Mr Prestowitz makes two central claims: that even if the Big Three are as good at making cars as the Japanese (which he says they are, more or less), they still cannot compete because of various unfair costs; and that Japanese firms are using bumper profits from their closed home market to ""subsidise"" their losses in America and Europe.
The first of these claims is shown in the table. (Table omitted.) The institute reckons that it costs American firms $1,926 more to get each car out of the factory door than at Japanese firms. The report then insists that four sums must be subtracted from this to get a ""true"" gap in productivity of only $120. Yet these sums do not survive closer scrutiny:
* By ""excess capacity costs"", Mr Prestowitz means that too many factories are trying to serve the American market; the Big Three cannot sell all they could produce, and so are carrying excess capacity. Yet this is a truism. If the Big Three were efficient, somebody else's capacity would be ""excess"", not theirs. So to subtract $445 a car for this is like saying: if they were efficient, their costs would be lower. Precisely.
Moreover, other figures in Mr Prestowitz's report inadvertently explain the excess. He proudly points out that Harbour & Associates, a consultancy, found that in the 1980s eight of the ten most productive plants in America were owned by Ford, not by Japanese firms. Yet on the next page he shows that in 1991 the Japanese transplants were still, on average, more productive than the Big Three. So Detroit has some great plants, but it also has a lot of junk-excess capacity, in other words.
* American firms carry health costs for their workers that firms in Japan do not. So Mr Prestowitz subtracts $505 to cover that extra burden. Yet this is to compare apples and oranges. American health-care costs are mostly paid through private insurance, with premiums borne by employers. In Japan health-care is mostly provided by the state, like Britain's National Health Service--which does not mean it is free, but that it is paid for through payroll taxes. Naturally, Mr Prestowitz does not deduct a sum from Japanese costs to reflect these taxes. Such taxes in Japan would be lower than the premiums, because American health-care costs have ballooned--but Japanese firms can hardly be blamed for that.
In any case, if employers pay their workers' health premiums, such premiums are merely a form of salary. Wage negotiations reflect the total, not just one component of it. Health costs cannot simply be deducted, for they are part of labour costs. The test of efficiency is whether firms respond to the cost of their labour and, if necessary, find more productive ways in which to use it.
* Ignoring this point, Mr Prestowitz goes on to deduct a further $316 for labour costs. There is indeed a gap: the Bureau of Labour Statistics says that in 1990 American car workers received $21.93 per hour, including all benefits and bonuses, while Japanese ones received $15.77. Yet figures for the whole of manufacturing suggest either the opposite--that Japanese wages generally are higher than American ones--or are ambiguous on the issue. American car firms may well have bucked the national trend on pay. That provides a clue to Detroit's failure, which is why it is bizarre to scratch it out.
* Lastly, Mr Prestowitz cuts out $540 because American firms' cost of capital has been higher than that of Japanese firms. Capital costs reflect many things: inflation and currency risk, and the financial condition of firms, are prominent among them. In effect, Mr Prestowitz is saying that the Big Three should be compensated for America's higher inflation rate, its poor macroeconomic policy, and the fact that they themselves are riskier investments than their Japanese rivals. He adds that in 1987-89 Japanese capital costs tumbled because the soaring Tokyo stockmarket enabled firms to issue mountains of cheap equity warrants. This is true, but misleading: share prices have now gone into reverse, making those warrants costlier than they seemed and raising the long-term price of capital.
The Economic Strategy Institute's other chief claim--that Japanese car firms are subsidising sales in America--is shown in the left-hand chart. (Chart omitted.) Japanese car firms do not reveal regional profits and losses, and Mr Prestowitz's report gives no source for the chart. His colleague, Paul Willen, says he cannot disclose the source, but it comes from ""a large American financial institution"". Such reticence is not surprising, for the accusation is the most explosive in the protectionists' armoury: dumping.
It is an interesting claim. As the right-hand chart shows, however, it is not unusual to make money in one market and lose it in another: GM, the world's biggest car firm, was doing this in 1990. (Chart omitted.) Even so, the report's Japanese figures are curious. During most of the 1980s, a ""voluntary"" restraint deal was restricting Japanese car exports to America, enabling the Japanese to raise their prices and profit margins in that market. And the classic basis for a dumping claim--prices abroad below those at home--does not hold for cars. Surveys by (among others) Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff University, have shown that Japanese car prices are lower at home than in the United States (where they are, in turn, far lower than in Britain). Mr Rhys calls the Prestowitz chart ""analytically bizarre"".
There is an explanation, however. Japanese car companies have been building new car factories in America in recent years. Such start-ups always take time to turn a profit. So if all the depreciation charges on that investment, as well as training, recruitment and other costs, are deducted from profits in America, then such factories might well generate an overall loss for the firms. Yet it is hardly surprising, or unfair.
Even so, it is droll that in the same report Mr Prestowitz also makes a contradictory claim: that the Japanese car companies are, in fact, making lots of money in America, but are using high transfer prices for car-parts to ship profits home to the parent and avoid paying American taxes. So which is it: subsidies or tax evasion? It cannot be both.
FULL OF EASTERN PREMISE
Everyone knows about Japanese-owned factories in America: they are sleek, meritocratic models of industrial efficiency where all the well-rewarded workers wear matching tracksuits. In the case of the Japanese-owned car factories (the ones most journalists and academics visit) that picture may be true. But a new study about to be published by the Institute of Labour Relations at the University of California's Los Angeles campus suggests that many Japanese-owned factories are more like sweat-shops.
Roughly a fifth of Japan's American jobs are located in California. Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at UCLA, visited 50 Japanese-owned factories, each with more than 100 employees. Among other things, these factories made plastics, electronic items, metals, medical products and car-parts. Her conclusion is that the much-hyped car-plants are the exception, not the rule.
When asked about ""Japanese"" manufacturing techniques such as flexible work teams, many of the American managers working for the Japanese-owned plants looked blank. In a sample of 20 firms that Ms Milkman studied more closely, a mere four had the vaunted ""just-in-time"" stock-control system; only two factories had formal ""quality circles"".
Other studies have accused Japanese firms of siting their plants away from big ""minority"" areas. In contrast, the Californian factories happily hired women recently arrived from Latin America and Asia. Immigrants made up over half of the work force. ""With what we pay, if they wear shoes, we'll hire them,"" explained one manager. In many ways, Ms Milkman points out, the Japanese plants are no worse than their American-owned equivalents; but they are a long way from the industrial paragons they are assumed to be. Like other foreign owners, the Japanese firms have cordial relations with Japanese unions at home, but are fiercely anti-union in California. Only five of the 100 plants are unionised.
One small speck of light: Ms Milkman found the Japanese-owned plants did offer more job security. Nearly two-thirds of the firms reported no lay-offs in the past five years. The reason? Their unusually high employee turnover meant that, to reduce staff, they never had to sack anyone."

The first of these claims is shown in the table. (Table omitted.) The institute reckons that it costs American firms $1,926 more to get each car out of the factory door than at Japanese firms. The report then insists that four sums must be subtracted from this to get a ""true"" gap in productivity of only $120. Yet these sums do not survive closer scrutiny:
* By ""excess capacity costs"", Mr Prestowitz means that too many factories are trying to serve the American market; the Big Three cannot sell all they could produce, and so are carrying excess capacity. Yet this is a truism. If the Big Three were efficient, somebody else's capacity would be ""excess"", not theirs. So to subtract $445 a car for this is like saying: if they were efficient, their costs would be lower. Precisely.
Moreover, other figures in Mr Prestowitz's report inadvertently explain the excess. He proudly points out that Harbour & Associates, a consultancy, found that in the 1980s eight of the ten most productive plants in America were owned by Ford, not by Japanese firms. Yet on the next page he shows that in 1991 the Japanese transplants were still, on average, more productive than the Big Three. So Detroit has some great plants, but it also has a lot of junk-excess capacity, in other words.
* American firms carry health costs for their workers that firms in Japan do not. So Mr Prestowitz subtracts $505 to cover that extra burden. Yet this is to compare apples and oranges. American health-care costs are mostly paid through private insurance, with premiums borne by employers. In Japan health-care is mostly provided by the state, like Britain's National Health Service--which does not mean it is free, but that it is paid for through payroll taxes. Naturally, Mr Prestowitz does not deduct a sum from Japanese costs to reflect these taxes. Such taxes in Japan would be lower than the premiums, because American health-care costs have ballooned--but Japanese firms can hardly be blamed for that.
In any case, if employers pay their workers' health premiums, such premiums are merely a form of salary. Wage negotiations reflect the total, not just one component of it. Health costs cannot simply be deducted, for they are part of labour costs. The test of efficiency is whether firms respond to the cost of their labour and, if necessary, find more productive ways in which to use it.
* Ignoring this point, Mr Prestowitz goes on to deduct a further $316 for labour costs. There is indeed a gap: the Bureau of Labour Statistics says that in 1990 American car workers received $21.93 per hour, including all benefits and bonuses, while Japanese ones received $15.77. Yet figures for the whole of manufacturing suggest either the opposite--that Japanese wages generally are higher than American ones--or are ambiguous on the issue. American car firms may well have bucked the national trend on pay. That provides a clue to Detroit's failure, which is why it is bizarre to scratch it out.
* Lastly, Mr Prestowitz cuts out $540 because American firms' cost of capital has been higher than that of Japanese firms. Capital costs reflect many things: inflation and currency risk, and the financial condition of firms, are prominent among them. In effect, Mr Prestowitz is saying that the Big Three should be compensated for America's higher inflation rate, its poor macroeconomic policy, and the fact that they themselves are riskier investments than their Japanese rivals. He adds that in 1987-89 Japanese capital costs tumbled because the soaring Tokyo stockmarket enabled firms to issue mountains of cheap equity warrants. This is true, but misleading: share prices have now gone into reverse, making those warrants costlier than they seemed and raising the long-term price of capital.
The Economic Strategy Institute's other chief claim--that Japanese car firms are subsidising sales in America--is shown in the left-hand chart. (Chart omitted.) Japanese car firms do not reveal regional profits and losses, and Mr Prestowitz's report gives no source for the chart. His colleague, Paul Willen, says he cannot disclose the source, but it comes from ""a large American financial institution"". Such reticence is not surprising, for the accusation is the most explosive in the protectionists' armoury: dumping.
It is an interesting claim. As the right-hand chart shows, however, it is not unusual to make money in one market and lose it in another: GM, the world's biggest car firm, was doing this in 1990. (Chart omitted.) Even so, the report's Japanese figures are curious. During most of the 1980s, a ""voluntary"" restraint deal was restricting Japanese car exports to America, enabling the Japanese to raise their prices and profit margins in that market. And the classic basis for a dumping claim--prices abroad below those at home--does not hold for cars. Surveys by (among others) Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff University, have shown that Japanese car prices are lower at home than in the United States (where they are, in turn, far lower than in Britain). Mr Rhys calls the Prestowitz chart ""analytically bizarre"".
There is an explanation, however. Japanese car companies have been building new car factories in America in recent years. Such start-ups always take time to turn a profit. So if all the depreciation charges on that investment, as well as training, recruitment and other costs, are deducted from profits in America, then such factories might well generate an overall loss for the firms. Yet it is hardly surprising, or unfair.
Even so, it is droll that in the same report Mr Prestowitz also makes a contradictory claim: that the Japanese car companies are, in fact, making lots of money in America, but are using high transfer prices for car-parts to ship profits home to the parent and avoid paying American taxes. So which is it: subsidies or tax evasion? It cannot be both.
FULL OF EASTERN PREMISE
Everyone knows about Japanese-owned factories in America: they are sleek, meritocratic models of industrial efficiency where all the well-rewarded workers wear matching tracksuits. In the case of the Japanese-owned car factories (the ones most journalists and academics visit) that picture may be true. But a new study about to be published by the Institute of Labour Relations at the University of California's Los Angeles campus suggests that many Japanese-owned factories are more like sweat-shops.
Roughly a fifth of Japan's American jobs are located in California. Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at UCLA, visited 50 Japanese-owned factories, each with more than 100 employees. Among other things, these factories made plastics, electronic items, metals, medical products and car-parts. Her conclusion is that the much-hyped car-plants are the exception, not the rule.
When asked about ""Japanese"" manufacturing techniques such as flexible work teams, many of the American managers working for the Japanese-owned plants looked blank. In a sample of 20 firms that Ms Milkman studied more closely, a mere four had the vaunted ""just-in-time"" stock-control system; only two factories had formal ""quality circles"".
Other studies have accused Japanese firms of siting their plants away from big ""minority"" areas. In contrast, the Californian factories happily hired women recently arrived from Latin America and Asia. Immigrants made up over half of the work force. ""With what we pay, if they wear shoes, we'll hire them,"" explained one manager. In many ways, Ms Milkman points out, the Japanese plants are no worse than their American-owned equivalents; but they are a long way from the industrial paragons they are assumed to be. Like other foreign owners, the Japanese firms have cordial relations with Japanese unions at home, but are fiercely anti-union in California. Only five of the 100 plants are unionised.
One small speck of light: Ms Milkman found the Japanese-owned plants did offer more job security. Nearly two-thirds of the firms reported no lay-offs in the past five years. The reason? Their unusually high employee turnover meant that, to reduce staff, they never had to sack anyone."

Europe's richest economy used to boast one of the lowest inflation rates in the world and one of the strongest currencies, thanks to sound monetary policies and prudent public finances. Switzerland also enjoyed stable growth and the lowest unemployment rate in the industrialised world. No longer. Over the past couple of years it has picked up some nasty foreign habits: high inflation and rising unemployment.
Last year Switzerland's inflation rate averaged 5.9%, up from 0.7% in 1986 and higher than the average of the countries in the European Community for the first time in two decades. Over the past year the once cast-iron Swiss franc has been the weakest of the big currencies, with a 12% slide against the dollar. Meanwhile, Switzerland's attraction as a financial centre also seems to have faded (see page 89). Tight monetary policies to mop up this mess have pushed the economy into recession. GDP fell by an estimated 0.5% last year and is forecast to grow by only 1-1.5% in 1992. The jobless rate has more than tripled since 1989, to 2.2%, which is low by the standards of most other countries but is viewed with horror in Switzerland.
Many Swiss blame the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which allowed the money supply to explode in 1988, for their country's economic problems. Like Germany's Bundesbank, the SNB is independent of politicians and has price stability as its main objective. This should have helped preserve its credibility as an inflation fighter. Yet Switzerland and Germany, the countries with the world's most independent central banks, are both suffering uncomfortably high inflation. What has gone wrong? In the long term independent central banks do help to keep inflation lower, but in the short term their task may, as in Switzerland's case, be complicated by structural factors.
The blame for the initial surge in inflation does, however, lie with the SNB. For years its monetary policy depended on controlling the monetary base, a policy which was clearly successful. But monetary compasses are not as reliable as Swiss watches. The relationship between the monetary base and nominal GDP broke down in 1988. A change in bank-reserve requirements and the introduction of a new electronic bank-clearing system made it harder to interpret the different monetary measures. Unfortunately, these institutional changes occurred soon after the world stockmarket crash in October 1987, when the SNB, like many other central banks, eased its monetary policies to avoid a sudden contraction in demand. Instead, interest rates fell too far and the economy overheated.
Although the SNB may be guilty on this first charge, it is not to blame for the fact that several years later inflation remains too high, at 4.9% in the 12 months to January. The SNB tightened its policy in late 1988, but inflation has been slow to respond. One reason for this is that the government went on a spending spree, undermining the SNBs tight monetary policy. The total budget (central and local government and social-security funds) swung into deficit in 1991 for the first time since 1984. Some of this reflects the effect of the recession, but the structural budget balance has deteriorated sharply.
Another problem has been the indexation and cartelisation common throughout the Swiss economy. Housing rents, for example, are, in effect, indexed to mortgage interest rates. When the government raises interest rates in order to squeeze inflation, rents--and hence the consumer-price index--automatically increase. With two-thirds of the population living in rented accommodation, and rents accounting for almost a fifth of the consumer-price index, this simply ratchets inflation up another notch.
A second factor is that another two-fifths of all prices are determined either by the hundreds of private cartels that operate in Switzerland, particularly in the professions and in distribution, or by state firms, such as the telecommunications monopoly. Both have used their excessive power to push up prices.
Combine these upward pressures on consumer prices with Switzerland's traditional practice of indexing wages to the previous year's inflation and it is easy to see why inflation has been so slow to respond to tighter monetary policy. To bring its inflation rate down to acceptable levels, Switzerland will now have to endure a more prolonged slowdown than might otherwise have been necessary.
Switzerland needs to dismantle cartels and scrap indexation agreements not only to bolster the SNB'S fight against inflation, but also to give a much-needed boost to economic efficiency. In December the Swiss will vote in a referendum on whether to join the European Economic Area (a free-trade zone which will link the EC with EFTA, of which Switzerland is a member). Membership would oblige Switzerland to dismantle cartels and encourage competition.
The government is also now in favour of eventual full membership of the EC. But sufficient public support for the interim stage of joining the European Economic Area, let alone full membership of the EC, is far from guaranteed. For example, joining the EC would require Switzerland to introduce a value-added tax. But such a tax has already been turned down by Swiss voters in three different referendums.
Switzerland's current mess is partly due to its previous economic success, which meant that the government faced less pressure to liberalise the economy than governments in other countries. How many years of sluggish growth and high inflation must the Swiss suffer before they, too, decide to act?"

In a report published on February 12th, its contribution to the United Nations' ""Earth Summit"" in Rio de Janeiro in June, the GATT gives warning that the environmental movement is in danger of being hijacked by trade protectionists. The report then goes on to argue that free trade helps--not harms--the environment.
Trade makes countries richer, and the rich pollute less, points out the report. For example, air pollution in cities rises with national income to around $5,000 per head per year, but then falls as income increases further (see chart). (Chart omitted) Moreover, trade helps clean technology to spread. Even though trade also provides bigger markets for dirty industries, the best remedy is good environmental policy, not trade sanctions, which merely keep poor countries poor.
The GATT's existing rules, says the report, respect a government's right to set high national standards for the environment. They insist only that legislation applies to imports and domestic production alike, and that standards should not arbitrarily be devised to deter imports. Thailand's ban on imported cigarettes, supposedly on health grounds, was a case in point. It was overturned because there were no restrictions on domestic cigarette-production or sales, which is in fact a lucrative government monopoly in Thailand.
Yet it is a different matter for one country to use trade barriers to foist its own standards on others. GATT rules ban such ""environmental imperialism"". American environmentalists are still bristling over a GATT ruling against a ban by the United States on imports of tuna from Mexico, imposed because the United States alleged that, according to its own rules, Mexican fishing boats kill too many dolphins.
Similarly, the GATT's report gives warning against calls for a ""level playing field"" code words for protection against imports from countries whose lax environmental standards give their industry an ""ecological subsidy"". The report concedes that some firms do move across borders to take advantage of permissive laws, but claims there are also plenty of cases in which firms gain a competitive edge by investing first in clean technologies.
The report also argues that, where pollution has only local effects, environmental policies are a matter of preference--no different from other policies affecting competitiveness, such as labour laws, education and tax. Letting countries raise tariffs against such policies ""would risk an eventual descent into chaotic trade conditions similar to those that plagued the 1930s.""
Even when pollution crosses national boundaries, the GATT argues that action is rarely, if ever, justified. It says that in the long run, carrots, such as aid or technology, will promote co-operation over the environment far more effectively than sticks, such as trade sanctions, ever could. One GATT-friendly suggestion is that internationally tradeable pollution permits should be introduced. Also, poor countries deserve payment for the ""carbon absorption services"" provided by their rain forests and this could help reduce deforestation as part of an accord to combat global warming. By contrast, a ban on imports of tropical hardwood would affect only 1% of the trees chopped down, according to the report; 80% of them are burned locally as fuel.
Lastly, the report argues for reducing existing barriers to trade in the interests of greenery. Witness the proposed deal to cut farm subsidies under the Uruguay round of trade talks. Production would shift from protected farmers in rich countries, who use more fertilisers and pesticides, to less-polluting farmers in poor countries."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224168005/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/38?accountid=14657,"Few markets are more exposed to downturns in consumer spending than the one for fancy athletic shoes. After all, how many recession-pinched parents are willing to cough up $150 so that junior can have a pair of super-hydraulic moonboots--especially when he already has last year's megasonic courtstompers and the techno-torrid turfgobblers of the year before that? After a decade when sales grew by 20-40% a year, America's $5.8 billion sneaker market expanded by only 4% in 1991. This year, predicts Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder Peabody, it will not grow at all.
This has persuaded many companies in the sneaker business to change tack. The costly, gadget-laden shoes so popular in the 1980s are out; gizmo-free, cheaper ones are in. Adidas, New Balance and L.A. Gear are all touting downmarket brands. Even bosses at Nike, whose flashy marketing of $100-plus shoes has made the company the industry's leader, talk of an end to ""conspicuous consumption"" and the appeal of fashionable ""gimmickry"".
Don't tell that to Reebok, the industry's other giant and Nike's main competitor. Recently the company unveiled two new ""revolutionary breakthroughs in shoe design"" (read gimmicks) for their premium-priced Pump line of sneakers, which have miniature air pumps and inflatable cushions to give a snugger fit. The breakthroughs, Insta-Pump and Pump Custom Cushioning, employ cushions filled with carbon dioxide from hand-held canisters. The point, says Reebok, is to make adjusting the shoes' fit more ""precise"". One of the running shoes with Custom Cushioning, the Dual Chamber, will have tiny electronic pressure gauges with digital read-outs.
Who needs these frills? Serious athletes, says Reebok, and those who think themselves such. Although shoes using the new technologies will not be in the shops until 1993, the company is giving them to runners for the Barcelona Olympics. Reebok hopes this will persuade image-conscious consumers to pay a premium for prestige; surveys show that 80% of sneakers are bought for panache, not performance. Reebok will not say how much the shoes will cost, only that it will be more than the $159 charged for the priciest Pumps.
Reebok knows it is running against the crowd. Its rivals are shifting downmarket, and cheap, classic canvas sneakers--Keds, Converse All-Stars--are trendy again. Sales of two of Reebok's cheaper brands, Freestyle and Princess, are growing fast. But Ford Ennals, Reebok's marketing boss, says a hot upmarket product might help to ""kickstart"" the stalled sneaker market. It also might help the company catch up with Nike.
For most of the 1980s, Reebok led its rival by several market-share points. But in 1988 Nike surged ahead. In a business where image is crucial, Nike's advertising, produced by film directors such as Spike Lee and carrying the slogan ""Just Do It"", put Reebok's ads to shame. Big retail chains, which account for 20% of Reebok's sales, complained that the company had stopped consulting them about styles.
In the past two years the Pump line has helped Reebok narrow Nike's lead in market-share to four percentage points over. Reebok's 25%. Reebok's domestic sneaker sales rose 14% last year (compared with 5% for Nike), contributing to a 33% increase in net profits, to $235m, on sales of $2.7 billion. In the year to June 1991 Nike made profits of $287m on sales of $3 billion.
Now Reebok is aiming to close the gap further. That means better marketing. The company is working closely with retailers, and will increase its advertising spending in America from $90m to $150m--$25m more than Nike. Indeed, Reebok's new high-tech shoes seem intended to get publicity that might rub off on other brands, such as Double Pump, whose sales are starting to sag. It may work. But, unless the back-to-basics trend abates, Reebok may find itself hawking pricey sneakers to consumers less interested in digital doodads than in something affordable to put on their feet."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224132866/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/39?accountid=14657,"The World Bank, an international aid agency, showed more guts than most multinational companies when on Febrile 7th it signed a deal with International Discount Telecommunications (IDT) for cut-price telephone calls. IDT is an upstart company founded by Howard Jonas, a 35-year-old publisher, which promises dramatic reductions in its clients' telephone bills by routing their international calls through a call-you-back system in Hackensack, New Jersey.
Although Mr Jonas's sales pitch sounds irresistible, few big users apart from the World Bank, Pepsi-Cola and NBC, an American television network, have bought it. On a call from Rome to Rio de Janeiro, for instance, IDT' clients pay only $1.64 a minute. This compares with 4,917 lire ($4.10) a minute charged by Italcable, Italy's state-controlled telephone monopoly. A call from Johannesburg to the United States costs IDT's clients $0.84 a minute compared with the 6 rand ($2.20) a minute charged by South Africa's national telephone company. For big users, such reductions add up to big savings, more than enough to offset IDT's $150-250 a month subscription charge.
So why have there not been more multinational companies signing on with Mr Jonas? The fear of reprisals from national telephone companies is the most plausible explanation. Spain's Telefonica, which charges up to three times as much for international calls, mutters that IDT breaches Spanish laws that give it a monopoly on international calls originating in Spain. Italcable, which charges even higher rates than Telefonica, denounces IDT as ""a pirate"". France Telecom has threatened legal action against the firm. The anger of these and other national monopolies is understandable. IDT is tiny but it could prove the thin edge of a very thick wedge.
IDT's clients are each given a number that gets them through to a node in Hackensack when they call from outside the United States. After one ring, the client hangs up. The node is programmed to recognise the caller and rings the client back within three seconds. The client is then able to make international telephone calls through the American long-distance carrier he has chosen to handle his calls. The three big American carriers--American Telephone & Telegraph, MCI and Sprint--are fierce competitors and so charge far less for international calls than the monopoly and quasi-monopoly utilities that provide the telephone service in most other countries.
Even the World Bank seems reluctant to risk upsetting big telecom monopolies. The aid agency's experimental contract with IDT, using AT&T as its American carrier, is for World Bank offices in four West African countries: Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Togo, all recipients of World Bank loans. These countries seem carefully chosen. Countries that get money from the World Bank are less likely to take offence than those who give it."

It was used by many otherwise sound businesses to avoid court-awarded damages or to break unions. Now a popular new variant, pre-packaged bankruptcy, looks like making bad worse. Managers who overburdened their companies with debt in the 1980s, but whose firms retain healthy underlying businesses, see it as a cheap and easy way to dump creditors. And in ""pre-packs"", managers have an even better chance of holding on to their jobs.
Pre-packs reverse the order of play of traditional bankruptcies. Usually a troubled company dives for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of America's bankruptcy law, as Macy's, a New York retailer, did on January 27th. Then managers and creditors spend enormous amounts of time--and huge sums of money on fees to lawyers, investment bankers and accountants--squabbling about who among shareholders, bankers, bondholders and trade creditors will suffer the most. Pre-packs avoid that squabble: Robert Allen of Berlack, Israels & Liberman, a New York law firm, reckons they typically cost a tenth as much as conventional chapter 11 filings.
Better yet for managers, pre-packs greatly increase the chance of a firm surviving with its existing bosses. Only one firm in ten that files under chapter 11 re-emerges intact to continue its business. With a pre-pack, the deal with creditors is worked out first, making re-emergence virtually certain. Then the company goes into chapter 11 for a mere two to four months to get court approval for the restructuring plan, compared with 2-1/2 years in chapter 11 for a conventional bankruptcy. Memorex Telex, an electronics group that filed a pre-pack on January 6th, had its deal approved by the bankruptcy court on February 7th and is due to emerge from chapter 11 as early as February 18th.
In one sense pre-packs are like old-fashioned out-of-court reorganisations. Although pre-packs were made possible by the 1976 revision of the bankruptcy code, they became popular only recently (see table), thanks largely to court rulings and changes in tax laws that have made out-of-court settlements less attractive to creditors. (Table omitted.)
There are two other big differences between out-of-court reorganisations and pre-packs. One is speed. Voluntary work-outs tend to drag on even longer than chapter 11 proceedings. The first big firm to opt for a pre-pack, Republic Health in 1989, did so only after trying in vain for two years to arrange an out-of-court reorganisation.
The second difference goes a long way to explain the first: pre-packs can be forced on minority creditors. Unlike conventional chapter 11 reorganisations, pre-packs do not need the near-unanimous agreement of creditors, especially if bond exchanges are involved. The approval of a simple majority of creditors, and of those representing two-thirds of the value of the debt outstanding, is sufficient. No wonder pre-packs are so popular with managers. Once a court has approved the reorganisation plan agreed to by the majority, other creditors must go along with it, making it easier to side-step creditors holding out for favourable deals. The increasingly complex capital structures of American companies have made inter-creditor warfare more common, and thus raised the value of being a ""hold-out"". Disgruntled junk-bond holders have proved particularly truculent. And ""bond-raiders"" have appeared who buy a firm's debt expressly to become hold-outs.
Managers like pre-packs for another reason: they make past mistakes less expensive. In the largest and most complicated pre-pack yet attempted, that of Southland, a convenience-store group, creditors had to swap 15-3/4% notes for ones with a face value of only a third as much and bearing an interest rate of only 4%. Creditors such as the California Public Employees Retirement System accepted such a scalping because it swiftly got them a deal that would let them sell their notes.
For all their new-found faddishness, pre-packs are not for everyone. Speed alone will not help a company that has no hope of trading profitably even after a capital reorganisation, or faces large contingent liabilities for past pollution or a product that has injured customers. Such a firm should be heading for chapter 7 liquidation. No creditor is going to agree to take a ""haircut"" unless he feels a firm will have earnings from which he will get at least some of his money back.
DEEP, DEEPER, DEEPEST
Economic commentators are falling over themselves in their haste to pronounce their national economies dead. America's current economic recession is being billed as the ""mother of all recessions"": the economy, it is claimed, is mired in its longest recession since the second world war. In Britain, where the government is trying to blame its recession on a sluggish world, critics claim that the British recession is deeper than anybody else's.
Which country really deserves the Deepest Recession Award? The Economist's rankings, drawn from the 24 OECD countries, are based on the old technical definition of two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. Of those that publish quarterly GDP figures, only eight countries meet that test. They also all meet an alternative definition: a year-on-year fall in output.
Some say Germany should be included too, since its GNP (the measure of output Germany prefers, which consists of GDP plus net foreign income) fell in both the second and third quarters of last year. But its GNP in the third quarter was still 1.9% higher than a year earlier. France, Italy, several other EC countries and Japan have also so far technically escaped a recession, although European workers who have lost jobs over the past year will find little consolation in that.
Of the eight in the chart, Finland wins the contest hands down. (Chart omitted.) By September 1991 it had had five consecutive quarters of declining output, to give a total peak-to-trough fall of 6.9%. New Zealand comes second, with a total drop of 4.3% between the fourth quarter of 1989 and the second quarter of 1991; its output picked up in the third quarter. Many New Zealanders, however, would argue that their economy has been in recession for far longer: it has seen no net growth since 1986.
Britain's 3.6% fall in GDP means that it has had the deepest recession of any of the Group of Seven big industrial economies. As for America, its recession strictly lasted only two quarters, with a fall in output of 1.6%, making this one of the shallowest recessions on record. Although you would never know it from the American press, the economy enjoyed three quarters of modest growth in 1991. Not everything in America is biggest and best."

Envious enough, perhaps, to sign a deal? BA is trying to agree upon a three-way merger with Holland's KLM and America's Northwest Airlines. If the deal goes ahead, it could produce a wave of mergers among Europe's cartelised airlines.
BA and KLM reckon the world's airlines will consolidate into about a dozen global ""mega"" carriers. It seems almost certain that America's three biggest firms--American Airlines, United and Delta--will be among the survivors of any worldwide shake-out. Each of these airlines is at least twice the size of British Airways, currently Europe's biggest long-haul carrier (see chart). (Chart omitted) Japan Air Lines, All Nippon Airways and Singapore Airlines are leading a powerful Asian contingent. But in Europe a score of most state-owned carriers are jostling for position and no clear winners have yet emerged.
BA and KLM remain tight-lipped about the details; but the plan is for the two air lines to set up an Anglo-Dutch holding company that would combine their service marketing and maintenance. Merging these, operations would, according to some estimates, save L300m-500m in costs within three years. This would come in handy in Amsterdam; KLM lost 8.9m guilders ($4.9m) in the three months to December. But the talks have stalled over the issue of how much of a stake existing BA and KLM shareholders would get in the merged airline, and so how future profits should be split.
Bringing Northwest into the deal is proving trickier still. BA has long been keen to forge a link with an American airline and so win access to America's huge domestic market. KLM owns a 20% voting stake in Northwest, the maximum level of foreign ownership currently allowed by the American government. Ideally, BA would like the Anglo-Dutch holding company created by a BA-KLM merger to gain control of Northwest. With a quarter of its airlines bankrupt and with Northwest heavily in debt, America might relax the rules. But the price demanded by Northwest's shareholders could yet foil such a takeover.
Even if Northwest drops out of the deal, BA and KLM will probably try to go ahead with their own merger. The chief reason is the European Commission's plans to push through later this year a drastic deregulation of the European Community's airline industry. If the Community's member states agree, this would abolish the web of government-to-government agreement allocating routes within the EC and fixing fares.
The commission's plan would stop short of America's ""open skies"" deregulation of its airlines in 1978. Although any EC carrier would be allowed to operate on any route, fares would still be regulated to a limited degree and there might be rules guaranteeing competitors' access to airports, to stop a single airline from dominating any one airport, as has happened at many of America's larger hubs.
Despite these qualifications, the commission's deregulation scheme would boost competition and slash European fares, making it virtually impossible for each European country to maintain its own ""flag"" carrier. in anticipation of this, many of Europe's state-owned airlines are being privatised. When profits return to the industry, more privatisations are likely. The German government is keen to sell its remaining 59% stake in Lufthansa. Greece will try to sell a 49% stake in Olympic Airways later this year.
BA and KLM are not the only airlines preparing for a new era of competition. Air France has acquired its top French rivals, UTA and Air Inter, and is buying a 20% stake in CSA, Czechoslovakia's airline. Air France also wants to take a stake in Belgium's troubled Sabena. Lufthansa has formed a powerful alliance with Japan Air Lines and is currently negotiating a link with America's USAir. Scandinavia's SAS has formed a marketing alliance with Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
A BA-KLM merger could force the partners in such alliances to opt for fully-fledged mergers too. Both BA and KLM are names that have good reputations among passengers, so it makes sense for them to continue flying under their existing names--at least for a while. Eventually a new, shared name could emerge. KLM'S chairman, Pieter Bouw, has said that his airline would be prepared to give up its identity in order to make a merger succeed."

Poland quickly auctioned off thousands of shops, and Czechoslovakia has tried to do the same. A handful of Polish and Hungarian firms have been floated on those country's infant stock exchanges. But most big firms in all three countries remain in state hands. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have sold only a few firms to foreigners. Both Poland and Czechoslovakia are now struggling with complex voucher schemes which try to balance the claims of fairness (ensuring everyone has a stake in privatisation) and efficiency (making sure ownership actually does get transferred).
It may prove different in Russia. Within a month of the start of a radical economic reform, Russia's state privatisation committee is about to embark on the boldest, and riskiest, privatisation effort of all. over 100,000 shops and most of the country's light industry are supposed to be sold at auction by the end of 1992, raising a minimum of 92 billion roubles ($852m at the current exchange rate). And this is only stage one. In 1993 and 1994, a further 850 billion roublesworth of assets (equivalent to an estimated 60% of Russia's GNP in 1991) is due to be sold.
Russian reformers are acutely aware that, so long as most firms remain in state hands, january's freeing of prices is unlikely to result in a big enough increase in output, which is desperately needed. With most employees on the government payroll, attempts to restrain the country's soaring inflation are also unlikely to succeed. But considering the discouraging slog that privatisation has turned out to be elsewhere, do the Russians stand any chance of meeting their ambitious targets?
Aware that the chances are slim, Russian reformers have tried to design a plan emphasising speed and simplicity. Anyone will be allowed to buy shares. The book value of firms will provide the opening bid in auctions or tenders. No fancy western-style auditing will be required, or time-consuming attempts to value enterprises. But three main features could delay, or even torpedo, the entire plan:
* The scheme relies heavily on the existing bureaucracy. In the fine tradition of five-year planning, local authorities have been given detailed targets for how many businesses and in which sectors, to sell in which region. This is as bureaucratic as it sounds, but it is no accident. Anatoly Chubais, the man in charge of privatisation, is the antithesis of the hatchet-faced apparatchik; he is a member of the reformist city government of St Petersburg. But Mr Chubais argues that Russia is so huge and its administration is disintegrating so fast that ""we have to use the classic Soviet style."" indeed, so many reform plans have been sabotaged by low-level bureaucrats in the past few years that the current government may have little choice but to try to work with, rather than against, the existing bureaucracy. The Soviet-style targets are the only bit of the privatisation programme that local authorities actually like.
All the same, bureaucratic hurdles are likely to slow things down. Mr Chubais's Committee for the Management of State Property, which is charged with disposing of state assets, is hurriedly setting up its own network of 60,000 local agents (it now has only 3,000). Organising this will be hard enough. Minimising conflicts with existing bureaucrats will be even harder. The Moscow city government, for example, already has its own privatisation scheme, based on giving businesses away, which conflicts with Mr Chubais's scheme. The government hopes to minimise such conflicts by offering local authorities 5% of any privatisation proceeds.
* The scheme gives more away to workers than any privatisation programme since Yugoslavia's. Russian workers will be given a quarter of their company's shares, or 20 times the minimum monthly wage (now 342 roubles), whichever is the lower. In order to prevent workers gaining control of the firm, as they did with disastrous results in Yugoslavia, the shares they receive will be non-voting preference shares.
Yet workers can also buy a further 10% of shares at a 30% discount to face value. They will get 10% of revenues from the sale of government-held shares. And newly privatised firms must set aside part of their capital to reimburse workers who buy any shares in any privatised firm (not just their own). Lest managers lose out to workers, they, too, will get options on 5% of the shares.
Clearly, Russia faces unusually grave problems persuading bureaucrats and workers of the virtues of private ownership. The Union of Working Collectives, one of Russia's biggest groups of trade unions and enterprises, has already criticised the government for not letting workers assume control of their firms. But concessions to such demands have their cost. If all the various offerings are taken up, more than 40% of enterprises'shares will end up in the hands of workers or managers. Giving such a large block of shares to workers and managers is halfway to spontaneous privatisation and will reduce or delay the assumption of control by potential owners.
* Russia has opted to sell, rather than give away, state assets. This seems bound to take longer than a give-away. The economists working for Mr Chubais say personal savings are sufficient to finance all the hoped for sales. But whether people will use their savings to buy state assets is another matter.
That depends on their confidence in the profitability of firms, not the volume of savings. No one knows how profitable most firms are, or can be. Worse, any profits, as well as the personal savings of potential buyers, are fast being eroded by inflation. Mr Chubais may be correct when he maintains that, ironically, inflation will encourage people to put their evaporating savings into tangible assets. But whether they will perceive shares in privatised firms as tangible assets remains to be seen. in any case, auctions still look like being more time-consuming than some kind of free distribution.
Foreigners have been excluded from bidding in the auctions, as have those enterprises that will remain in state hands. Barring state enterprises makes sense, since a purchase by them would hardly be privatisation. But excluding foreigners may be a mistake. The reason for their exclusion is that, at current exchange rates, they would be able to buy even big Russian firms for a song. But foreign investors could also bring with them additional finance and managerial expertise. The government is still toying with the idea of establishing a special exchange rate for privatisation auctions to allow foreigners to take part.
The underlying problem is that the government is pursuing two contradictory aims: to reduce the role of the state and to balance its budget. Both may be laudable. But it seems unlikely that both can be met."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224141030/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/43?accountid=14657,"LIKE the country's most famous product, Switzerland's financial system usually runs like clockwork. But in recent weeks its finely tuned mechanism has been shaken by bad news. On February 10th Swiss Volksbank, the country's fourth largest bank, added some more. After making bigger provisions than expected against duff loans, including $73m it had lent to Maxwell Communication Corporation, the bank announced that its net profit for 1991 had plunged by 38% to SFr68m ($48m).
Switzerland's three biggest banks--Credit Suisse, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC)--are also likely to report sharply higher provisions for 1991. One credit-rating agency has already anticipated them. In January Moody's lowered Credit Suisse's rating from AAA to AA1 and said that it was considering whether to downgrade SBC'S debt too. Only UBS'S credit rating is still unquestioned.
Until Moody's move, the big three Swiss banks were part of a tiny elite of banks with the ultimate AAA accolade for all their debt from all three leading rating agencies--Moody's and Standard & Poor's in America, and IBCA in London. With many American and Japanese banks tooking increasingly shaky, the Swiss with their AAA badge of good health have had a competitive edge. Now Switzerland's banks may find it a bit harder to convince potential customers that they are as solid as the Matterhorn.
Moody's decision also reflects its dim view of Switzerland's future as a financial centre. It reckons Finanzplatz Schweiz's attractions will diminish as international competition increases. An ailing domestic economy could hasten its decline. The Swiss inflation rate, long one of Europe's lowest, averaged 5.9% in 1991, only just below inflation-prone Italy's. And the Swiss franc, once rock-solid, now looks weak. Few expect the currency to regain the magnetic attraction it had in the 1970s.
Real interest rates in Switzerland have also risen sharply, contributing to a big increase in corporate bankruptcies last year. High rates have tipped the Swiss property market into collapse. That is bad for banks, since they account for 90% of Switzerland's SFr4OO billion mortgage market. Hans Kaufmann of Julius Baer, a bank in Zurich, reckons that perhaps 15% of these mortgages are now causing problems. To make matters worse, banks have been increasing their mortgage lending just as the cheap savings deposits that they use to finance it have been shrinking (see chart on next page). That has forced the banks to refinance at higher rates, squeezing their margins.
Although the biggest banks can absorb these extra costs, some of Switzerland's smaller regional banks cannot. Last October one regional bank, the Spar-und-Leihkasse Thun, collapsed under the strain. The sight of depositors queucing up to rescue their savings stunned those who believed that Swiss banks would never be allowed to fail. The regional bankers' association admits that 12 more of its 185 members are shaky.
Swiss moneymen accept that, with the country's reputation as a discreet haven for footloose cash under threat, they must come up with some cures for these ills. The stakes are high. The banking sector in Switzerland employs around 130,000 people, accounts for over 8% of the country'S GDP, and pays more than SFr7 billion a year in taxes. The banks are also big export earners. On one estimate, every third Swiss franc they earn comes from services sold to foreigners or from capital invested abroad.
The first part of the cure is to persuade the weakest of Switzerland's 630-odd banks either to merge with a stronger one or to close. On February 3rd UBS took over Bank EVK, an ailing regional bank, after EVK failed to produce enough capital to meet Switzerland's tough reserve requirements. To prevent a repeat of the Thun bank debacle, Swiss bankers have recently cobbled together a scheme that will provide advice and, if necessary, cash to ensure the orderly winding down of other troubled banks.
Another remedy lies on the cost side. Swiss banks are trying to trim their expenses. UBS has recently been trumpeting a new cost-cutting exercise with the grand title of ""Marketing 2000"". It is cutting the range of services on offer in some retail branches, closing others and centratising back-office functions. other banks are closing branches too, but staff numbers are barely falling.
Then there is the potential elixir of stockmarket reform. Although Switzerland has an automated futures and options exchange, SOFFEX, it lacks an efficient underlying market in bonds and equities. As a result, nearly a fifth of the turnover in leading Swiss equities now takes place on London's SEAQ International screen-based market, much to the annoyance of Swiss banks.
To help win back that business, three years ago a joint committee of the Zurich, Geneva and Basle exchanges asked Arthur Andersen, a consulting firm, to develop an electronic trading system for bonds. The brief was later extended to include equities too. However, Gian Pietro Rossetti, a manager at UBS and head of the joint committee, says that when Andersen presented its proposals in December they contained ""too many uncertainties with regard to time, performance and cost."" The bourses must now decide whether to adopt a modified version of the Andersen project or to go for some other system altogether.
There are two pieces of good news for Finanztatz Schweiz. Swiss companies such as Nestle and Hoffman-La Roche are at last improving the transparency of their accounts and scrapping restrictions on voting rights. This may stimulate takeovers in Switzerland, because Swiss shares look cheap by international standards. The other good news is that most of Switzerland's heavy stamp duties on foreign investors' securities dealing will be scrapped provided a referendum this autumn approves a bill that has been passed by the Swiss parliament.
Other changes could be forced upon Switzerland's financial markets soon, since like all members of the European Free Trade Association it has agreed to conform to European Community rules. That should not worry a financial centre that is already changing its ways. And the Swiss still have the benefits of a long tradition of close relationships with customers and ofa wealth of financial know-how.
Those Swiss bankers who nevertheless fear the worst should consider their watch industry. Ten years ago, many people had written it off because of stiff foreign competition. But by cutting costs, innovating and preaching the gospel of quality, Switzerland's watch industry has regained its fizz. It is now up to the country's bankers to prove that they can do the same."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224141093/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/44?accountid=14657,"FOR a time, investors had lost more than L190m ($340m). Then taxpayers were mugged for L150m in compensation. The exchequer proceeded to spend L7m on a two-year investigation and trial. But at least the Barlow Clowes case ended with convictions. Peter Clowes was sentenced to ten years in jail on February 11th. For taxpayers, that result tooks good value compared with the Guinness and Blue Arrow cases. An attempt to weigh up winners and losers from these trials yields instructive results.
Barlow Clowes first. Using newspaper advertisements that promised miraculous returns from government bonds, Mr Clowes netted L225m from mainly elderly investors which he invested in almost anything--other companies, fast cars, a vineyard and a chateau--apart from gilts. When Barlow Clowes collapsed, it had liabilities of L115m, and only L1.9m in gilts.
It sounds a simple enough fraud. But the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) dealt with it most seriously. The trial took 112 days and 113 witnesses; even so, the SFO secured the conviction of only two of the four accused. Yet the SFO was a winner and Mr Clowes a loser. The investors won too, with taxpayers and a blundering trade department losing.
Complicated fraud has proved tougher for the SFO. On February 7th it dropped plans for a third prosecution over the 1986 Guinness takeover of a rival drinks firm, Distillers. The SFO decided that it could not prove that the accused, including Guinness's stockbroker, David Mayhew of Cazenove, had criminally helped Guinness to support its share price during the bid.
Even more embarrassingly, the second Guinness trial collapsed on February 11th, after four months in court. The likely length and cost of this trial had persuaded one of the defendants, Roger Seelig, once a takeover specialist at Morgan Grenfell, that lawyers would ruin him financially. So he resolved to conduct his own defence, which nearly ruined him physically. Psychiatrists said that pursuing the case to the end might cause Mr Seelig permanent damage. The judge felt obliged to stop the trial.
Unless the SFO decides on a retrial, which is unlikely, this has blown away any chance of establishing whether Mr Seelig broke the law in helping to support Guinness's share price. All the legal wrangling since the Distillers takeover has produced only four convictions. The main offender, Ernest Saunders, former chairman of Guinness, was sentenced to five years in jail. Though he served only ten months, he was a clear loser. Winners include Mr Mayhew and his employer, who stood behind him when Morgan Grenfell had abandoned Mr Seelig; and Guinness itself, which has boomed since it bought Distillers even though it had to pay L100m in compensation to the rival bidder, Argyll.
Then there is Blue Arrow. The opening speech by the prosecution took a whole week--an ominous start. Now, after a year in court (cost: nearly L40m), five out often defendants have been acquitted by the judge, including the banks concerned in the attempt to make the 1987 Blue Arrow rights issue appear a success. Even so, both County NatWest and UBS Phillips & Drew lost face over Blue Arrow. On February 13th the jury was still considering its verdict on five individuals accused of conspiring to mislead the markets during the rights issue.
In reaching its decision, the jury has to weigh such technical issues as whether selling shares after the formal closure of a rights issue is normal City practice. Plenty of people reckon that such questions are beyond the competence of ordinary jurors. Even the judge in the Blue Arrow trial, Mr justice McKinnon, declared in his summing up that he had at times felt ""overwhelmed"" by the complexity of the evidence. After the collapse of Guinness Two, Mr Justice Henry called for a ""radical solution"" to the problem of fraud trials. Many took this as a justification for reviving the 1986 Roskill report's proposal that complex fraud cases should be tried by a judge and two financially literate laymen with no jury.
However that debate is resolved, something must be done to make trials shorter and cheaper. Looming ahead are cases like Polly Peck, BCCI and perhaps Maxwell, all three of which look at first blush more complex even than Guinness and Blue Arrow. Several changes have been mooted.
One is to emphasise simplicity. The SFO could trim its lists of charges and witnesses; justice would have suffered little had Mr Clowes been convicted on six counts rather than 18, and it seems excessive to have planned to call 80 witnesses in Guinness Two. Another idea is to discourage defendants more firmly from defending themselves; Mr Seelig's cross-examinations dragged on longer than any barrister's. Had Mr Seelig been offered more generous legal aid, his case might have been concluded.
Then there is the organisation and functioning of the SFO, which is less than four years old. its notion of mixed teams of accountants, lawyers and police officers sounds good in theory, but has been less successful in practice. The office needs a bigger and better staff. And it should be readier to recommend that cases that cannot support a criminal prosecution be dealt with by administrative sanctions such as barring individuals from directorships or withdrawing licences to practise in financial services. It is a formidable agenda for the successor to the present director, Barbara Mills, who has been named (as the last of the week's winners) as the next Director of Public Prosecutions.
SOFT COMMISSIONS, HARD TO DROP
Can pension trustees protect funds against the perils of soft commissions, the roundabout practice whereby investment managers pay brokers commission, then receive some of it back in kind? To secure such refunds--Reuters feeds or other services--fund managers may be tempted to trade more than they should, or to place orders with a soft broker even if they doubt whether they are getting the best possible prices. Britain's Securities and Investments Board (SIB) has prescribed rules to limit abuses, but says that it is up to trustees to safeguard their funds. That is easier said than done.
Bacon & Woodrow, a firm of consultants to trustees, has clients with reservations about soft commissions. It is hard for trustees to know whether a manager has traded too much or accepted prices that are less than the best. So some would prefer their fund managers to pay for investment research and other services directly. One group of Bacon & Woodrow's trustees is thinking of instructing its investment manager not to pay soft commissions out of its fund.
The investment manager (said to be among the City's bigger firms) has protested to Bacon & Woodrow that the SIB has allowed softing, so why should trustees worry? It says none of its other clients has prohibited the practice, so why should this one be an exception? And it has explained that a client who chose not to soft would unfairly benefit from soft commissions paid by others, since the Reuters feed improves a fund manager's performance on behalf of all his clients.
More threateningly, the investment manager has suggested that a client who refuses to permit softing might suffer from inferior service. Economies of scale prompt most big fund managers to trade shares for many clients at once. If one client objected to softing, his account would have to be traded separately. This might mean trading later: an investment manager does not like two brokers bidding against each other for the same stock. That could mean getting a worse price, since a large soft-commission deal immediately beforehand would move the market.
Such protests suggest no malice on the part ofthe investment manager: it is natural that clients demanding tailored treatment should pay for it. Some other investment managers are considering how to accommodate anti-soft clients; one example is Gartmore, though it says that making the necessary adjustments to its computers and management structure will take time. For the moment, however, pension trustees may be persuaded to put up with soft commissions rather than lose economies of scale.
Or they could switch to an investment manager that eschews softing altogether. The most prominent of these, Phillips & Drew Fund Management, took more new business than any rival last year."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224137522/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/45?accountid=14657,"The Tokyo stockmarket has been stuck in the doldrums for months. It is currently 46% below its all-time high. Yet there is a remarkable consensus among foreign broking firms about the direction in which the Nikkei index is headed: upwards. Even Barclays de Zoete Wedd, one of the few gaijin houses to have been correctly cautious during the bear market of the past two years, has now turned optimistic. In January it declared that Japanese shares were ""reasonably priced or better"".
Foreign brokers offer several explanations for such enthusiasm. One is that ""everybody is bearish"", by which they mean that the Japanese themselves remain almost wholly gloomy. Partly as a reaction--it is psychologically satisfying to be bucking the market--nearly all foreigners are bullish. Foreign investors made net purchases of Japanese equities worth nearly Y6 trillion ($45 billion) last year and have begun 1992 in the same spendthrift mood.
A second reason is the expectation that the stockmarket must soon respond to the steep falls in Japanese bond yields and short-term interest rates that have resulted from falling inflation and a slowing economy. Interest rates are likely to come down still more. Monetary growth remains anaemic. The main broad measure, M2 plus certificates of deposit, grew at an annual rate of only 2% in the fourth quarter of 1991. There is scant prospect of any sharp pick-up in the money supply because Japan's banks, plagued by bad debts, remain reluctant to lend.
There is also the fallout from Tokyo's crop of political scandals, which is holding up passage of the government's budget and so delaying any fiscal easing. This has produced still more pressure on the Bank of Japan to lower interest rates. As a result, most observers in Tokyo now expect the official discount rate to be cut again in the near future, perhaps by as much as half a percentage point to 4%.
On Wall Steet such a combination of bad economic news with ever-cheaper money has recently been good news for equities as investors have chosen to celebrate the lower interest rates rather than mourn the stuttering economy. In Tokyo bad news on the economy has yet to prove good news for the stockmarket. That could partly be because the market has been coming down from such a stratospheric level. Despite its two-year fall the stockmarket is still on a consolidated price-earnings ratio of 36 times the current fiscal year's earnings.
Tbe outlook for company earnings is another area of dispute between foreign and Japanese investors. Foreign brokers are especially keen on the shares of Japan's blue-chip exporters, whose earnings they expect to rise by 5-10% in the year to March 1993 thanks to a recovering American economy. Such shares are cheap by recent Tokyo standards. Nor are they expensive by comparison with Wall Street. Japanese carmakers, for instance, are selling on a p/e ratio of 17 times consolidated earnings in the year to March 1991. Electronics companies are on a p/e ratio of 18.
Most foreign brokers expect overall Japanese corporate earnings to be flat in the year to March 1993 after declines in each of the two preceding years. That might not sound good, but it is a lot better than some recent Japanese forecasts. Sanwa Bank has just published a survey that predicts a 23% decline in pre-tax earnings for Japanese companies for the year to March 1993, following a projected 14% decline in the present fiscal year. For manufacturing companies Sanwa expects an even steeper decline of 33%.
Admittedly, the Sanwa survey was based on a smallish sample of 176 companies in only 17 industries. But others are pessimistic too. Daiwa, for instance, forecasts an 8% decline in pre-tax earnings for the same period while Kleinwort Benson, one of the few gloomy foreign firms, predicts a 5% decline in the year to March 1993 on top of an 18% decline in the current fiscal year.
SELF-FULFILLING GLOOM?
If these forecasts turn out to be right, this will be the first occasion since 1945 in which Japan has suffered three successive years of falling corporate earnings. That might explain why so many Japanese investors are so bearish--and why bureaucrats and politicians are busy thinking of ways to boost the stockmarket. It is not just the market that is suffering. Companies are responding to such forecasts by slashing investment plans. Fujitsu and NEC, for instance, announced huge cuts in capital spending on February 12th at the same time as steep downward revisions in their profit forecasts.
This reaction matters because capital spending is the swing factor in the Japanese economy. Susumu Saito, a private economist based in Tokyo, notes that the ratio of private business investment to nominal GNP growth in Japan has fluctuated between 15% and 20% for the past 30 years. Once the ratio falls below 20%, he says, the growth rate of nominal GNP falls by half. Private business investment duly peaked at the end of 1990 at about 21% of GNP.
That partly explains why Kleinwort Benson, for one, expects only 1% real GNP growth in the year to March 1993, compared with the official Economic Planning Agency's 3.5%. True, such slow growth would mean lower interest rates, which on Wall Street's model should be good for the stockmarket. But it also manifests itself in such things as the collapse in orders that faces the suppliers of Fujitsu and NEC. So it might not be celebrated in a Tokyo stockmarket whose main participants, Japanese investors, still think that bad news is bad--unlike their perverse American counterparts.
A weakening economy combined with political scandals also raises the risk of a falling yen. The Bank of Japan has recently been talking the yen up and even selling dollars. Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, savours his reputation as the man who saved the Japanese economy from its recent speculative excesses. Yet if the interests of the economy and the financial system conflict with price stability and the value of the yen, even Mr Mieno might wilt and let the yen go. That is one more reason why foreigners should be paying more attention to what the Japanese are thinking than to their own sales patter."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136959/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/46?accountid=14657,"""Litigation is the most expensive means of settling a dispute short of warfare."" Thus Stephen Merrett, a Lloyd's underwriter, justifying the settlement on February 11th, after four months in court, of the Outhwaite case. Mr Merrett is right, but settlement itself is hardly cheap. The 985 Outhwaite ""names"" (rich individuals who provide Lloyd's capital) who had sued their agents will get L116m ($208m) from the agents' errors and omissions (E&O) insurers. That is about 90% of what might have been won in court, though the names are left with residual liability for any further losses that may be incurred.
The aggrieved names had charged Richard Outhwaite, their syndicate underwriter in 1982, with negligence for accepting 32 run-off contracts from other syndicates that turned out to be stuffed with asbestos and pollution liabilities. Losses mounted fast: Mr Outhwaite had to leave the 1982 year of account open, as it remains to this day. In 1988 the names decided to sue, aiming at their agents instead of Mr Outhwaite, partly because the agents had E&O insurance. Most of that insurance was underwritten by other Lloyd's syndicates, supported by around 16,000 names--including some of the very Outhwaite names who were suing. Ironically, they will now pay part of their own settlement.
The effect of this week's deal is thus to mutualise some of the Outhwaite losses across Lloyd's. Will that set a precedent for the cases of other disgruntled names? Certainly the Outhwaite outcome will encourage others who are thinking of suing, not least because the 600 Outhwaite names who did not sue got nothing in the settlement.
Yet Lloyd's, which acted as an honest broker between the parties, is quick to say that Outhwaite is sui generis. The E&O insurers clearly believed that they were likely to lose the case, partly because it had shown up the chaotic working practices of the Lloyd's market in the early 1980s. Names on other troubled syndicates with huge losses--Pullbrook, Gooda Walker, Feltrim--are also preparing for litigation. Though some of these involve claims of underwriting negligence, others are taking a different tack, such as challenging the validity of excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts. The E&O insurers may be less willing to settle these.
Even so, many names now hope that the Lloyd's establishment is shifting from its stingy refusal to help with their losses. Four days before the Outhwaite settlement, a smaller dispute involving 500 names on a 1984 Warrilow syndicate was settled. There are persistent rumours of a settlement of the Oakeley Vaughan case, which is set to go shortly to the House of Lords. In that case names are suing Lloyd's itself for failing in its duty to look after their interests.
Lloyd's also knows that the names' biggest grouse about the recent Rowland report on the market's future is that while it suggested a cap on losses after 1993, it offered nothing for those incurred in the past. The market is likely in June to report a loss of some L1.3 billion for 1989 (the latest year to close under Lloyd's three-year accounting system), with something similar expected for 1990. Outside forecasters predict a loss in 1991, too, though Lloyd's disputes this. With total losses from 1988 to 1991 averaging more than L100,000 per name, it would not be surprising if a majority of names ended up pressing some sort of lawsuit. Such an ugly spectacle would not help to attract the new names Lloyd's desperately needs if it is to grow in the 1990s.
Yet buying off threats of litigation by mutualising losses would cause troubles of its own. The E&O syndicate names will probably accept the judgment of their underwriters in the Outhwaite settlement. Next time, however, they might not be so pliant. If in some future case the E&O names concluded that the losses of the litigious few were being foisted on the less combative many, they might themselves start looking for someone to sue. They would have a point, for the biggest losses have come from syndicates that did the riskiest business--and made the biggest profits--in the early 1980s. Why should those who clung to caution be asked to bail out those who threw it to the winds? As for new names, they might be even more scared by the prospect of being saddled with past losses than by the sight of names throwing suits at one another.
In fact, a creeping mutualisation may arrive by default. Many of the names with the biggest losses either cannot or will not meet them. Lloyd's can quickly draw down the names' cash and securities deposits held by their agents. But one group of names will soon seek an injunction to prevent even that; and, anyway, many names face losses bigger than their deposits. Such losses have to be met out of Lloyd's central funds if names have shifted assets beyond Lloyd's reach or have no assets left. Lloyd's also promises not to enforce unlimited liability to the extent of depriving names of their homes. How kind."

A bulging rule-book is no capricious whim of American regulators, who dislike inflexible rules as much as banks. It is the handiwork of confused and over-zealous lawmakers. Over the next three years hundreds of provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), the law that emerged from Congress's botched attempt at bank reform in 1991, will come into effect. A new study for the New York State Bankers Association says bluntly that the FDICIA ""...clearly initiates an era of intense regulation.""
The new act also removes the regulators' discretionary powers to deal with troubled banks on a case-by-case basis. Such powers have been a cornerstone of bank regulation in America for half a century. Yet Congress never liked giving so much latitude to regulators. Its main aim with bank reform was to limit the potential risk to the taxpayer if the banks' woes were to turn into a re-run of the thrifts fiasco. To avoid that, it rejected such sensible solutions as trimming federal deposit insurance or imposing market disciplines. Instead Congress tried to legislate risk out of banking.
In the new, FDICIA-created order, the banks will face:
* rigid new capital rules; * lots of burdensome and expensive new reporting requirements; * a code of ""safety and soundness"" standards covering management, financial and pay practices; * regulators who must act as soon as a bank fails to measure up to any of these yardsticks; * a bill for recapitalising the bank insurance fund that banks will have to pick up, with riskier banks paying higher premiums by June 1993.
Some FDICIA provisions are plain daft, such as the one asking banks to keep a fixed ratio between their share price and their book value, and the one requiring regulators to set bankers' salaries. These may be among the rules, many drafted in hectic horsetrading moments before passage of the bill, that get quietly dropped or amended in a ""technical corrections"" bill later this year. But the FDICIA'S main aim--risk-reduction through tougher enforcement of capital requirements--will not be changed.
Nor can bankers hope that the whole measure might become moot thanks to a broader banking-reform bill. The Bush administration is again urging one on Congress. But those who witnessed last year's performance give this little chance, even if the bill were to make only small changes such as allowing banks to branch across state borders. The anti-bank lobby, notably the insurance industry (see box on next page), which knocked down last year's efforts to let banks move into new fields, retains as tight a grip on Congress as ever.
Instead, bankers, like nervous schoolgirls, are going to have to wait for their grades. The FDICIA creates five for bank capital: well-capitalised, adequately capitalised, under-capitalised, significantly under-capitalised and (the blackest mark) critically under-capitalised. The regulators can define these at the outset. Thereafter FDICIA's mechanistic rules take over.
That is just the beginning. After grading the banks, regulators are required to take one of the increasingly restrictive actions specified by the act for each category. A bank that slips down a grade may not increase its assets without regulatory approval or pay a dividend to its shareholders. For banks in the bottom two grades, regulators will have to take such drastic actions as forcing a stock issue or a merger, or requiring the appointment of new directors or managers. Regulators will have little choice but to take over bottom-grade banks. A similar regime will apply to banks that fail to meet the new safety and soundness regulations. And, to forestall regulatory recidivism, from the end of next year the Federal Reserve's freedom to lend money to a troubled institution through its discount window will be restricted.
Early intervention makes for cheaper taxpayer bail-outs if a dodgy bank fails. But it also blocks the chance that a bank might work out its problems with a little regulatory forbearance, and thus not leave any mess at all for the taxpayer. Experienced regulators reckon that making that judgment is one of their main functions. William Seidman, who has just left the chairmanship of the FDIC, says the ""trip wires"" that Congress has now imposed would have tripped some of America's biggest banks had they been in place in his day.
Building up capital so that they can meet Congress's new rules looks like being the most important task for bankers over the next couple of years. So much for the notion that they could take a breather concentrate on restructuring. Worse, the new rules come after two years of preparation for the Basle group's international capital-adequacy standards, which come into effect at the start of 1993. Some 96% of American banks now meet those standards, with a collective $70 billion of capital to spare. The remaining 4% are only $4 billion short.
Congress wants a plumper cushion of capital than that. The regulators have been given 18 months to come up with a proposal for new capital standards that takes account of banks' interest-rate, credit and off-balance sheet risks (the Basle group is also working on these, but Congress seems unfazed by international accords). They have also been told to ensure that book capital reported by banks is real capital available to the FDIC if necessary.
Critics point to two big flaws in Congress's approach. The first is that it places too many eggs in the basket of capital, requires some of the most technically difficult measures of it, and then sets its rules in stone. That ignores the reality of rapid technological change in financial services. The second flaw is that Congress wants to take the risk out of banks, but not out of banking. Much of traditional banking is no longer done by banks. The share of depository institutions (mostly banks) in financial-sector assets has fallen from almost 60% 20 years ago to barely a third today.
So FDICIA may regulate to death an industry that was dying anyway. Stopping the tradition of regulatory forbearance will hasten the industry's consolidation. Tougher capital rules will encourage securitisation of loans to get assets off the balance sheet. More customers will go direct to the capital markets as higher capital ratios push up loan costs. As the cost of insurance makes deposits less appealing to banks, more depositors--including the small ones that deposit insurance was meant to protect--will be driven elsewhere. Little wonder that Robert Clarke, the outgoing Comptroller of the Currency, now says ""banking is becoming a losing proposition.""
INSURING AGAINST COMPETITORS
After failing to get Congress to adopt a comprehensive bank reform bill in 1991, the Bush administration has narrowed its sights. It says it would now be satisfied if Congress were merely to permit banks to branch across state lines. That is still more than the large but fragmented insurance industry is prepared to stomach. Independent insurance agents, in particular, fear that banks selling insurance through branch networks would be formidable competitors. Better, they reckon, to nip interstate branching in the bud.
As banking and insurance have converged over the past two decades, bankers and insurers have been fighting for turf. Most of the battle has been waged not in the marketplace but in Congress and the courts. The insurers showed last year that they had the clout to get what they wanted on Capitol Hill. Not only did they block the banks' slow advance into insurance; they also managed to roll back some of the underwriting powers that banks had earlier won.
Insurance firms may now feel satisfied that they have restricted the banks' underwriting powers, but the independent agents think the fight is only half won. They are plotting to get Congress to roll back the banks' right to sell any insurance at all. A parallel assault is taking place in the courts. It is there that bankers have been most recently sandbagged.
In a surprise decision, federal appeals court judges have recently ruled that sections of a 1916 law that allowed banks in small towns to sell insurance had been repealed by a wartime mistake in 1918. Since 1986, federally chartered bank holding companies have been using this loophole to sell insurance nationally from one-horse towns. Unless the Supreme Court over-rules the appeal-court decision (or Congress re-instates the law), it will be illegal for banks to continue selling insurance.
Insurers are cock-a-hoop. They think banks will not dare to ask Congress to restore ""small-town"" powers for fear of offering the insurers the chance to lobby Congress to close the Delaware loophole permanently. This loophole, which the Supreme Court upheld in December but Congress shrank last year, allows state-chartered subsidiaries of bank holding companies to underwrite and sell insurance from Delaware.
Banks still have some options. Those that own thrifts can switch insurance business to them. And thrifts may soon be allowed to branch across state lines. As long ago as 1982 Congress gave regulators the power to allow nationwide thrifts. The regulators are thinking of using this as a backdoor way for banks to branch across state lines. But insurers are no more likely to stand for that than they are for the real thing."

The richest of these jokes, though, may be by nature itself. There is mounting evidence that the greenhouse warming expected by climatologists, caused by carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, may be being held in check by sulphur dioxide--also given off by fossil fuels.
Atmospheric sulphur dioxide forms a mist of small sulphate particles--an aerosol. This layer of particles will reflect some sunlight back out into space, protecting the surface of the earth. Such aerosols can also change the way clouds form, making them whiter and perhaps longer-lasting. Clouds also reflect sunlight. And reducing sunlight is prima facie likely to cool the earth.
It has been known for decades that aerosols can have these effects. But the issue has been thought of as a local matter of little importance in the grand scheme of things--even though in some areas, such as America's northeastern states, aerosols can cut down sunlight by as much as 7%. As the climate has become more closely scrutinised, though, so has the role of aerosols. According to Robert Charlson of the University of Washington in Seattle, who has studied the sulphates through thick and thin, the most reliable data now suggest that, taking into account the direct effects and the indirect effects mediated by clouds, the sulphates may be cutting the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface of the earth by one or two watts per square metre, from a total of a few hundred. The warming effect expected from a doubling in carbon dioxide is about two watts per square metre.
Because sulphates come back to earth fairly quickly in the form of acid rain, while carbon dioxide can live in the atmosphere for centuries, their effects on the global climate are hard to measure. There are hints, though, that the effects are there to be seen. One of the problems with climate models of the sort used to predict the extent of greenhouse warming is that they suggest that the climate should have warmed more over the past century than it has. If sulphates in the atmosphere are counteracting the warming, then this may explain the discrepancy.
Further evidence may come from work done by Thomas Karl of America's National Climatic Data Centre in Asheville, North Carolina, who, like Dr Charlson, spoke in a AAAS session on ""Uncertainties of Global Change Forecasts"". Dr Karl has been studying weather records for America, Canada, China and the Soviet Union gathered over the past 40 years or so, and comparing the minimum and maximum temperatures over months and years. The minimum temperature--normally recorded at night--has risen more than the maximum temperature.
Dr Karl does not know exactly what to make of this nocturnal warming. However, it is consistent with cooling by sulphate aerosols. Aerosols cool the days, but not the nights. Dr Charlson is sure that some of what Dr Karl sees is due to sulphate aerosols, but does not know how much: between 20% and 90%, he thinks. Cloud cover might also be a significant factor--and it, too, may depend to some degree on the presence of sulphates. Then again, greenhouse warming might of itself bring changes in weather that make the climate less extreme, thus getting rid of the lowest temperatures.
Such a bewildering array of options is always the climatologist's lot, and demonstrates why it is so hard to reach any firm conclusions about the effect of sulphates. Particularly troublesome is the fact that man-made sulphates are local, not global. Thus they cool only areas where there is industry, and they will not cool the oceans, which play a crucial role in the climate. Patchy warming might do as much damage to weather patterns as overall warming.
There might be a difference between hemispheres, too. There is less pollution in the southern hemisphere, and it is possible that the south is warming faster than the north, though the data are far from clear. Dr Karl is now studying minimum temperatures in the southern hemisphere. He would like to look at Europe, too, but he cannot afford to buy the data from the countries involved--the British records, he says, would cost him L50,000 ($90,000).
Close studies of North America and Western Europe are needed, however, because an experiment is going on in the atmosphere above them. Sulphate emissions in these countries have been declining for over a decade--with no appreciable effect on Dr Karl's measurements. It may be that, although there is less sulphate produced, it is produced in more widespread locations, and possibly from higher chimneys, thus making a more even and effective covering. These and other caveats make climatologists extremely cagey about the idea that there might be a case for encouraging sulphate aerosols; most rule it out and all agree that, as always, there are more questions to ask.
Some answers may come from a yet larger experiment going on yet higher up. The eruption last year of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines sent vast amounts of sulphate into the stratosphere, where it now girdles the earth. This should have a cooling effect, though not necessarily quite the same effect as mankind's sulphates, which stay closer to the surface. But how can the cooling be measured when the degree of warming in the world is still unknown? All these experiments lack controls; there is no sulphate-free world to compare things with, so there is no way of picking out the aerosol effects from the others that merge with them, amplify them and mitigate them. Without knowing everything, climatologists are hard put to be sure of anything."

Few technologies are more advanced than those with which plants protect themselves from hungry animals. The vast array of chemicals they contain, once dismissed by botanical chemists as ""secondary compounds"", are now presumed to be the weapons with which plants, who have no option but to stand and fight, deal with their enemies.
Human magicians--shamans, medicine men and witches--have long exploited this high technology, seeking out the chemicals in the plants' arsenals that work against human diseases. Now, though, it appears that herbalism may be even older than proponents of the old religions would have it. Chimpanzees use plants for medical purposes. And, according to the AAAS's session on zoopharmacognosy--crazy name, enthralling discipline--they agree with their human cousins about what is useful.
A variety of unpleasant wriggly things like to live inside chimps. The chimps disapprove of this, and have their ways of worming themselves. Richard Wrangham, of Harvard University, has discovered that, first thing in the morning, many chimps in the Kibale forest of Uganda head straight for their medicine cabinets--clumps of a plant called Aspila. They pluck and eat a few dozen of the leaves before they go about their daily business. They are fussy about which leaves they eat--they prefer the young ones--and how they eat them. Chimps eat a lot of leaves in the normal course of things, and chew them thoroughly. Aspila leaves are eaten whole and pass through the gut that way.
The reason for this lies in some small glands on the leaf surface. Elroy Rodriguez of the University of California at Irvine has found that these glands, which burst open as the leaves pass through the chimp's gut, contain a group of compounds called thiarubines. Dr Rodriguez concentrated in particular on thiarubine A, which has a beautiful intense red colour and is deadly to nematode worms. Nematodes are common, and tiny ones attack plants; that is presumably why Aspila is armed with thiarubine. Much larger worms sit in animal guts, depriving their hosts of food and sometimes causing pain.
In the Mahale mountains of Tanzania another primatologist, Michael Huffman of Kyoto University, observed that one of the chimps he was studying was suffering badly from the symptoms of worm-infestation. The chimp dosed herself with the pith of another plant, Veronia, and within a day and a half the symptoms had gone. Thus alerted, Dr Huffman realised that a lot of the chimps were using Veronia, particularly during the wet season when worms are abundant. The chimps always ate only the pith. Local people also value Veronia as a medicine, and they too use the pith. The plant contains potent poisons called terpenes. Those in the pith are strong enough to kill a wide variety of gut parasites without killing the patient. Those from other parts of the plant can be even more lethal; hence the caution.
Their detailed knowledge of the local pharmacopoeia is more than just another demonstration of the sophistication of chimpanzee culture. Western medical science, once disdainful of herbalism, is moving into the tropical forests in search of new medicines. It is not easy to look through the vast numbers of plants which herbalists claim are useful, and not all will deliver what is promised. But if two different species agree that something works, the chances are that it actually does. It is then up to the modern conjurers of pharmaceuticals to discover how the tricks are done and to generate, through some suitably advanced technology, their own brand of magic."

In Chicago insalata vendetta provoked a certain amount of lipsmacking from that small but dedicated band, the Neanderthal-watchers, These fossil-hunters have looked on with increasing concern over the past few years as their hard-won interpretations of human origins have been elbowed aside by newcomers armed with blood samples and computers. Now one of the most cherished of these new notions, that of the ""African Eve"", looks close to collapse.
Since the first remains of a truly ancient human were discovered in 1856 in the Neander valley near Dusseldorf in Germany, fossil-hunters have striven to piece together the history of humanity from the bits and pieces of skeletons they have found scattered over the world. It was a slow and painstaking task. Then, in 1987, it appeared to be overtaken. A geneticist called Allan
Wilson announced that he had more or less done the job for them on a computer. Wilson, who died last year, found his Eve not in scripture but in mitochondria. Mitochondria are cells-within-cells that provide the body with energy. Like the cell nucleus, they contain DNA--but unlike the DNA in the nucleus, this mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not rearranged every generation. All children get their mitochondria from their mothers. If there were no random mutations, your mtDNA would be the same as your grandmother's, and her grandmother's, and so on to any degree of great-grandmotherliness you care to imagine.
However, there are random mutations, and they accumulate. Wilson reasoned that closely related populations would have many of the same errors in their mtDNA, whereas populations that had not interbred For hundreds of thousands of years would have much less in common. Using this principle and a computer, he drew up a tree showing how people all over the world were related, in terms of their mtDNA. With a model of how fast the mutations mount up, he was able to give dates for the points at which the tree branches. Thus Wilson calculated that everyone on earth today can trace their roots to a single woman who lived in Africa about 200,000 years ago; this Eve's descendants peopled Africa, and then later spread out over the world.
The story was neat and exciting, but some worried about the way it seemed to conflict with the fossil record. The world into which Eve's descendants spread was already peopled--by Neanderthals among others. Wilson's theory requires Eve's line to remain pure: modern humans are descended from her, Neanderthals are not. That means there could have been no interbreeding when the two types of man were neighbours, and that Neanderthals could not be ancestral to modern Europeans.
This was questioned by Neanderphiles in Chicago. Rachel Caspari of the University of Michigan showed how features that are meant to be unique to Neanderthal skulls are still found in fossils that are in other respects undeniably the ancestors of modern man. Alan Mann, of the University of Pennsylvania, examined the striations of Neanderthal teeth and found them similar to those of present-day Europeans and very different from modern Africans. Milford Wolpoff, also from Michigan, reviewed evidence for continuity between Neanderthals and moderns in Middle Eastern fossils.
This dogged work may now be vindicated. Two letters in the most recent edition of Science have cast doubt on the existence of Eve. Alan Templeton of Washington University in St Louis, and a group from Pennsylvania State University, led by Blair Hedges, point out that the ""family tree"" that Mr Wilson derived is not unique. It is just one of hundreds consistent with his data; others, including some unfavourable to Eve and to Africa, might be better.
This does not mean African genesis is no longer likely. Modern Africans are much more genetically diverse than the rest of humanity, which suggests that people have lived in Africa for longer than elsewhere. It may be that they have lived there even longer than Wilson and his colleagues thought. One way to reconcile all the ideas may be to make Eve much older--to say that the tree is basically correct, but that the clock is wrong. Wen-Hsiung Li, of the University of Texas, believes that DNA evolves more slowly in apes and men than in other species because of their long generations. Such a slowing of the clock, stretching the tree back in time, could merge the two theories; if Eve is far enough back, then Neanderthal man could also be descended from her.
The truth may come from merging the techniques of the two camps, as well as their ideas, and getting blood from ancient stones. Thomas Loy of the Australian National University in Canberra specialises in this arduous extraction. At the AAAS meeting he announced that he had recently found a stone tool from northern Iraq stained with the blood of a careless workman who had cut himself while whittling a piece of wood, 180,000 to 200,000 years ago. The DNA from his blood could answer some important questions, if it is recoverable. No DNA anywhere near that old has yet been extracted and made sense of, but techniques are improving all the time. If they improve enough, it might be possible to say whether Europeans descended from Neanderthals and whether Neanderthals descended from Eve."

The minutes after the launch of a nuclear missile are such a time. It is hard to launch a nuclear missile, if proper command and control systems are working. But if--through accident, or sabotage, or the madness of a general at Burpelson air force base--a missile does get launched, there is nothing to be done after the bird has flown except hope that it misses and pray for forgiveness.
A few years ago this began to worry Sherman Frankel, a professor of physics at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr Frankel knew that rockets used for launching satellites can be blown up by remote control if they go wrong. Why not do the same for nuclear missiles? At first he thought that, since the idea was obvious and no one was doing anything about it, there must be a flaw. So far he has not found it. Perhaps it is just that common sense lags behind missile technology. The Permissive Action Links (PALS), code systems that lock missiles against unauthorised firing, were not invented until America already had 20,000 nuclear weapons.
By analogy to PALS, Dr Frankel calls his gadgets Destructive Action Links (DALS). The idea, as he explained to a AAAS session dealing with tactical and ballistic missile defences, is quite simple. Missiles are given a self-destruct system of some sort, triggered by a code received via radio. If the supreme commander wants to launch the missiles, he sends a code which authorises the officers in charge to launch, and another which turns off the missiles' radio receivers, so that they cannot possibly receive the destruct code. That means the enemy can never use those codes against missiles launched on purpose--but unauthorised launches could be aborted. Of course, PALS are meant to stop them ever happening, but a belt-and-braces approach seems a reasonable precaution.
There are many bells and whistles that might need to be added, and Dr Frankel admits that without security clearances the details cannot be worked out. But the technology is simple, the cost small and the potential gains huge--especially if the DALS are installed on nuclear missiles in other countries, particularly those in the former Soviet Union. America's current plan for anti-missile defences would cost more than $20 billion to implement. That plan, described for the meeting by Edward Gerry of the strategic Defence Initiative Organisation, goes by the name ""Global Protection Against Limited Strikes"". One sort of limited strike discussed is accidental or unauthorised launch. Dr Gerry happily agreed that if all nations had ways of aborting their missiles, the system could be made smaller and cheaper.
Dr Frankel has been pushing his ideas for some time now, perhaps most usefully when he spoke to the defence department's Nuclear Failsafe and Risk Reduction Advisory Committee, chaired by Jeane Kirkpatrick, last November. If the idea was as well received there as it was in Chicago, then maybe some action will follow. After all, it is never too late...except when it is."

The secret heart of this murky book reveals itself on page 172, where its author remarks: ""Although pure speculation, this seemed to me not implausible"". Here, the ""not implausible"" idea in question is that an Israeli prime minister ordered the murder of a prominent Austrian Jew who had expressed sympathy for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. But ""pure speculation"" is no less apt a description of the 338 pages that omit the health warning.
Patrick Seale is a British journalist who used to cover the Middle East for the Observer. His headline-grabbing contention is that Abu Nidal (real name Sabri al-Banna) and his gang of Palestinian terrorists are the creatures of Israel's secret service, the Mossad. Israel, he argues, organises their campaign of maiming and murdering in order to blacken the Palestinian cause.
Given Abu Nidal's many atrocities--slaughtering Jews at prayer in an Istanbul synagogue, mowing down passengers at El Al ticket desks in Rome and Vienna--this is a grave charge. Yet Mr Seale does not have a jot of serious evidence to back it up; only the tittle-tattle of retired ""intelligence agents"". By the book's end he is advising readers to reach their own conclusions on the matter. By then, however, it is too late.
So what is the author's case against the Mossad? Mainly that Abu Nidal's terrorist activities are so grotesque that they make the Palestinians look bad; and that since Israel is the only conceivable beneficiary of such deeds, Abu Nidal must be operating under Israeli orders. This is roughly like saying that Yitzhak Shamir works for the PLO because (in the view of many people) Israel's prime minister has been damaging Israel's reputation for years. Besides, Abu Nidal is far from the only Palestinian to have harmed his own cause through terrorism. The PLO itself went through a ferociously blood-thirsty phase in the 1970s, doing itself no good at all in public opinion. Not even Mr Seale accuses Yasser Arafat of working for the Mossad.
A second line of argument is that the Abu Nidal organisation, unlike all other Palestinian groups, is seldom the victim of, and indeed almost immune from, attacks by Israel. This might look sinister, if it were true. But, by Mr Seale's own testimony, it is not. For a third line of argument, which he puts forward to show the extent to which the Mossad has penetrated Abu Nidal's organisation, is that the Mossad instigated an internecine feud inside it, as a result of which Abu Nidal butchered hundreds of his own best fighters. Now either the Mossad was protecting the group or it was conspiring to destroy it. Mr Seale looks suspiciously like wanting it both ways.
He wants it both ways again in his conclusion. Here Mr Seale declares that if his thesis is right, and the Mossad is running Abu Nidal (or manipulating him, or subtly influencing him; Mr Seale never quite decides), it is proof of the Jewish state's ""moral depravity"". But if the Mossad is not involved, as he half-concedes it might not be, then Abu Nidal's crimes are a testament to Palestinian suffering, for which Israel must still take the blame.
This is not only a neat way to ensure that Israel cannot win. It is also a cavalier way to treat readers who have struggled through a din of blowings-up and assassinations all the way to the final chapter. If the author is ready to accept that there may be no truth whatever in his ludicrous yarn, why bother to spin it in the first place?
According to Mr Seale, the idea that the Mossad might be running Abu Nidal did not enter his head until it was put there in 1990 by Abu Iyad, who (until being killed by one of Abu Nidal's men) was Mr Arafat's intelligence chief. Even then it struck him as ""preposterous"". Abu Iyad, he admits, was hardly a neutral source. Having spent a lot of his career trying to murder Abu Nidal and to avoid being murdered by him, Abu Iyad had an interest in painting his main Palestinian rival as a creature of the hated Mossad. Even so, Mr Seale was intrigued enough to start investigating.
This version of events sits uneasily with Mr Seale's record. Far from finding it preposterous that the Mossad should be controlling Abu Nidal, he should have taken Abu Iyad's hypothesis as confirmation of his own conspiratorial hunches. For in his previous book, a sympathetic biography of Syria's President Hafez Assad, Mr Seale had argued that the Mossad was somehow behind Syrian intelligence's attempt in 1986 to blow up an Israeli airliner in London. He also supported the idea that the 1967 Arab-Israeli war was the product of a brilliant Israeli plot to lure Nasser into war. This was the 1970s version of the present-day conspiracy theory that says the United States deliberately lured Saddam Hussein into Kuwait in order to clobber him there.
Intelligence is a rum business. Western intelligence services, Israel's included, would be shirking their duties if they did not try to penetrate the Abu Nidal organisation. But there is a world of difference between penetration and control. Although pure speculation, it seems not implausible that Mr Seale set out on this exercise to besmirch the Jewish state, and refused to allow any evidence--or lack of it--to modify his prejudices."

Perhaps, if he had listened more to his level-headed wife and less to the blandiloquence of Richard Nixon, the late shah of Iran might not have lost his throne. That, at any rate, is one impression left by the fascinating diary of Asadollah Alam.
Aristocratic Alam was the servant and confidant of the low-born shah for over two decades. As prime minister in 1963, he saved the shah from Ayatollah Khomeini's first attempt at Islamic revolution by ordering the army to fire into the crowds. His diary starts in 1969, when the shah was near the zenith of his power, and ends in 1977, when revolution was already in the air (and Alam was dying of cancer). Then minister of court, Alam's job was to fix everything from the noisy palace plumbing to the shah's dealing with kings, presidents, and girlfriends. He saw the shah most days. They were excellent friends, sharing meals, games of tennis and extra-marital ""sprees"". The shah, the diary proves, was a serial adulterer.
Although Alam was utterly devoted to his ""great, beloved Shahanshah"", his diary draws a picture of a deeply unattractive man, stiff and arrogant, convinced of his own infallibility and contemptuous of his ministers and generals (and also of most foreign dignitaries). The Iranian people never quite shaped up to the shah's grandiose vision of Iran as the Japan of the Middle East, on course to build ""The Great Civilisation"" and overtake the West within a decade. The shah thought his people ""ungrateful"" for his efforts on their behalf.
Beneath the shah's pomposity lay weakness and insecurity. The diary shows that his greatest fear was not, as might have been expected, the Soviet Union--he believed that the West would never let Iran fall to communism. It was that his British and American allies, who were arming him to the hilt, would one day topple him, as they had toppled his pro-Nazi father.
Almost to the end, the diary shows, the shah remained convinced of the faultlessness of his rule, and never intended (as others have suggested) to introduce democracy--despite Alam's urgings. Some of the blame must go to foreign flatterers. He got praise by the bucketful from Richard Nixon, who told him at a Washington reception that ""All your majesty has achieved .. . and all that you continue to achieve, truly merits the description majestic."" ""There is not"", declared Henry Kissinger, ""a greater man around.""
The shah believed that he was the ruler of a country of happy peasants and contented workers, enjoying free education and health care and lacking no material comfort. Senior officials and courtiers, including Alam, encouraged these delusions. The exception was the shah's third wife, Queen Farah. ""She has a knack"", wrote Alam, ""of putting her finger on our most serious weaknesses."" But queen and shah (she told Alam) saw ""eye to eye on nothing"".
Too late, the shah recognised the need for (minor) reform. In January 1977, he told Alam: ""We're broke. Everything seems doomed to grind to a standstill."" Alam records ""dreadful portents"" of coming disaster, as oil revenues tumbled, the country was beset with power cuts and Jimmy Carter increased the pressure for human-rights reform. The shah, who felt that he and Alam had crushed the power of the mullahs back in the 1960s, was shocked to see ""thousands of women wearing the veil"" in south Tehran. ""It terrifies me that everything will simply cave in around us"" wrote Alam. It eventually did, but by then Alam was dead and the shah was powerless to stop it."

At the height of one battle in Nicaragua, contra officers complained that their CIA minder, Don Johnson, a Texan Green Beret, was giving all the orders. ""Whose war is this, anyway?"" asked one rebel, in fury.
He might well have asked. Sam Dillon's is a necessary book: the definitive story of the contra rebels and their ten-year struggle against Nicaragua's Sandinists, and the only balanced treatment of the subject so far. No one has written about the conduct of the contras on the battlefield with the insight and authority of Mr Dillon, who worked in Central America for the Miami Herald in the 1980s.
His book makes no effort to dress up the story for entertainment. In fact, the woeful tale needs no embellishment. Mr Dillon simply attempts to capture some of the filthy reality of a war which few who had no part in it could understand, and also shows how many of those involved perpetually tried to distort the truth. He fleshes out the story with numerous anecdotes drawn directly from the sources involved, a number of important revelations and the correction of some well-established myths.
To help the narrative along, Mr Dillon charts the experiences of Luis Fley, a top contra commander whose nom de guerre was ""Jhonson""(sic). Mr Fley's ancestors emigrated to Nicaragua earlier this century from, of all places, Budleigh Salterton in Devon. After what might be called a good war, with a distinguished combat record, Jhonson became a tireless investigator of human-rights abuses within the contra army. He was later one of the first contras to return to civilian life in Nicaragua and to campaign (this time, politically) against the Sandinists in the February 1990 elections.
""Commandos"" provides a powerful account of contra human-rights abuses. It is no secret that abuses occurred; but had the scale of the brutality been known at the time, and reported to Congress, it could have changed the history of the war. With the help of Jhonson, Mr Dillon prises open case after case, revealing as he goes along a monumental cover-up of the evidence, involving every level of the American government from the White House down to the embassy in Tegucigalpa, from which the contras received their orders.
This reluctance to bring offenders to justice was bad enough when it was Congress that was pressing for change. But the behaviour of American officials was even more disgraceful when the clean-up was being demanded by the contras themselves. When one particularly violent contra commander, known as Mack, was accused by Jhonson of complicity in torture, rape and murder, the CIA ensured he was protected and promoted.
Mr Dillon also seeks to show a positive side to the contras, describing how they evolved from a rag-tag army of former soldiers in the brutal National Guard of Anastasio Somoza to an effective fighting unit of peasant volunteers. At the height of their success, in 1987, they had the Sandinists on the run. But their dependence on American supplies and military strategy meant they would never become a self-sustained guerrilla insurgency. Although in 1986-87 Congress was spending $10,000 per man on the 10,000-man contra army, it was not enough; or, to look at it another way, it was too much."

As the first millennium of the Christian era approached, many people were convinced that the world was coming to an end. Some chose to purge their souls in preparation for heaven, others preferred to indulge in earthly delights while they could. Nothing as exciting appears to be happening now, although the second millennium is only eight years off. The best prospect on offer is a religion called New Age.
It is rather a loose religion. It has no churches, unless one counts the specialised bookshops where disciples browse amid the smell of incense and the sounds of Tibetan chant. It has saints, but they are a diverse bunch, among them Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, Carl Jung and Walt Disney. Followers of New Age are not instantly recognisable, although some wear white, for purity, and crystal jewellery. What they appear to have in common is a belief that heaven can be created on earth, rather than having to hang about for death and the uncertain promise of deliverance. They want it now, a familiar desire.
The dream world of Disneyland is a practical example of a man-made heaven. But don't be put off. New Agers also favour communes, Glastonbury, paganism, witches, hallucinogenic drugs, cryonics (freezing bodies to be restored to life later), bartering and, ah, sensuality. The arrival of the year 2000 is not expected to change things overnight, as the year 1000 was forecast to do, but New Agers believe there will be clear signs of something better.
Or worse. One of the maxims of New Agers is ""You have the power."" That is, the power to take control of your life and escape from the monotony of everyday existence. ""Feeling"" comes before theory. Rachel Storm, in her absorbing book, points out that it is sometimes the leaders of New Age groups that have the power; just as Charles Manson and Hitler did, both of whom also claimed to offer heaven on earth.
Some members of the organised churches are so bothered about New Age ideas that they ascribe them to Satan. What if the New Agers did what the Christians did? They were the Bolsheviks of religion. They swept to power, as Lenin did, by rallying the drifting millions who were waiting for someone to give orders. They took over the old pagan rites and festivals, modifying them as necessary and claiming them as their own; but fiercely proscribing anything that contradicted their teaching, condemning it as immoral, and, if pursued, heretical and to be burnt from the earth. That is how you impose your will for 2,000 years.
New Age, though, looks too diverse to be organised. Its followers, though no doubt sincere, promote ideas that are simply dotty. New Age may last for a bit longer. But when nothing much happens come the millennium (except what?--a new round of GATT talks?), it will die of boredom."

Until a huge Caravaggio show was held in Milan in 1951, his works were scarcely known; and, in some respects, mystery still surrounds him. Why, for example, is there none of his drawings around? Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael made countless drawings, usually preliminary sketches for their paintings or sculpture. Now a new exhibition at the Pitti Palace in Florence (until March 15th, when it moves to Rome) attempts to fill the gap for Caravaggio.
The 20 pictures in the show have been subjected to x-rays, to reflectography monitoring (with a special camera that is sensitive only to infra-red reflections) and other modern wizardry now available to art historians. From these methods Caravaggio experts can confirm two remarkable, even revolutionary, things.
One is that Caravaggio painted directly on to his canvas. He made no preliminary tracing, even when the picture might contain a dozen figures. Apparently, his only guidelines for most of his works were incisions, or slashes, on the ""prepared"" canvas (shown by the white lines on the painting above). Painting often he would slash the outline of a subject's ear, scalp or beard, and not much else. ""He drew by painting,"" a near-contemporary noted with wonder.
Electronic probing also confirms that Caravaggio broke with tradition by painting exclusively from live models, possibly using one model twice in the same picture. He also painted at a furious speed, and rarely with second thoughts or corrections.
A canvas was usually prepared with a coating of gesso (plaster of Paris) mixed with animal glue, followed by another coating that might contain clay, bitumen, white lead or coloured pigment. Caravaggio's canvas, when he was ready to start his slashing, might have had up to five coats applied, and he would often end up with the canvas entirely covered with a reddish-brown hue. His slashes were probably done with a stylus or with the stiletto that he always (illegally) carried, and which he used in 1606 to murder a Roman ""skinhead"" who had beaten him at pallacorda, a game similar to tennis. That murder sent him rushing into exile, as a papal law allowed anyone to kill a condemned murderer.
The current show lets Europeans see for the first time in a century the painter's original ""Card Cheater"", which turned up in Zurich in 1987 and was snapped up by the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. Experts who have contributed to the catalogue also raise again the theory that the two faces in ""David Holding the Head of Goliath"" are self-portraits of Caravaggio as a teenager and as a bearded old monster. Italy's 100,000 lire banknotes, which bear another self-portrait of the painter, would seem to confirm that thesis.
Caravaggio never returned to Rome after his exile. He had taken passage on a small boat from Naples to a town near the mouth of the Tiber, then held by the Spanish, who took him off for questioning and imposed a bond. When he returned to the dock, the boat had set sail on its return to Naples, taking with it two paintings commissioned by a Roman cardinal. Caravaggio died at the age of 39, probably of dysentery, near that small port. One of those two last paintings, ""A Young St John the Baptist"", is in the Florence show.
Of the 20 paintings, one has now been officially demoted: the ""Narcissus"", one of his most popular works. Electronic probings show that it is not a Caravaggio. The brush-strokes are too painstaking and uncertain to be from a master's hand. The brass label beneath the picture, attributed to Caravaggio by Longhi, who found it in a private collection in Milan in 1913, and by Bernard Berenson in 1951, has been changed. It now reads Spadarino, the nickname of Giovanni Antonio Galli, a scarcely known contemporary painter and admirer.
A footnote emerges from the latest Caravaggio research. The canvas he used for at least three pictures, including the National Gallery's ""Salome and Florence's Sacrifice of Isaac"", is sail-cloth. This was imported to France from Genoa, which the French call Genes. It is the same material which, in the 19th century, was first used as heavy-duty cloth for the trousers now known as blue jeans."
15-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224137638/fulltext/C6B2F6C7D6F1470DPQ/57?accountid=14657,"When Orion Films declared financial disaster last year, one question entered many minds: who would distribute the latest offering from Woody Allen? For the past 20 years, as regularly as a fashion collection, Mr Allen has made a new film. He says he has to, or else he will fall into depression.
By September the scare was over: Mr Allen would open his new film, ""Shadows and Fog"", in Paris on February 12th, and the distribution would be handled by Columbia. The film will then go to the Berlin Film Festival (appropriately enough, since it is vaguely based on Fritz Lang's ""M""), and will open in America at around the end of March.
The delayed American release may be as well, for ""Shadows and Fog"" is not exactly made to American tastes. For one thing, it is in black and white. This is fitting for a period-piece set in the 1920s in Mitteleuropa, about a Kafkaesque clerk who joins a posse to hunt a murderer and finds himself being pursued as a suspect. But black-and-white films do not sell in America, and gloomy Woody Allen films such as ""Interiors"", heavily modelled on Ingmar Bergman, are if anything even less popular.
Paris, on the other hand, reacted with joy to the news of the premiere. Among the French, Mr Allen's star is second only to that of Jerry Lewis; indeed, some French critics have called him the greatest working film director. Others refer to him as ""the most European of America's directors."" Mr Allen's obsessions with God, guilt, paranoia and psychoanalysis play well all across Europe; and there are many who feel that the next best thing to being paranoiac and living in New York is to watch a Woody Allen film. The box-office figures for the showing of a recent Allen film, ""Alice"", were higher in Paris than for the whole of America.
Mr Allen had already started to cash in on this immense prestige by filming four commercial spots, for a chain of Italian supermarkets, for a reputed fee of over 1 billion lire ($845,000). The four commercials, each lasting less than a minute, with such gags as a piece of meat being displayed at an art gallery, were given a place of honour at the Venice festival in September. But it is in France that Woody-frenzy has reached its peak. Readers may select from the oeuvres completes of Mr Allen in eight volumes, or choose from five books in print about the master. ""Alice"" is an odds-on favourite for the Cesar for best foreign film (France's equivalent of the Oscar) at the awards ceremony on February 22nd.
The emotion does not seem to be reciprocated. To coincide with the opening of ""Shadows and Fog"", Anne Sinclair, a top television journalist, flew to New York to interview Mr Allen. Mr Allen could not come to Paris because he did not wish to miss his weekly stint playing the clarinet in a Greenwich village dixieland band. This refusal to let his hair down in Paris (so unAmerican) sounds in character for a man who says he prefers writing to reality because it prevents contact with reality, and who also, for the same reason, prefers filming in studios rather than out of doors.
In the event, the opening of ""Shadows and Fog"", was something of a disappointment; but no French critic could quite bring himself to say so. ""Since 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan',"" wrote L'Express, ""we love Woody Allen, and even if 'Shadows and Fog' isn't a masterpiece, who cares!"" The reviewer went on to find Mr Allen's guilt and paranoia just a little too repetitive, and other critics wondered whether he had not borrowed just a bit too much. Mr Allen has always lifted ideas from directors he admires, although he also stoutly denies it. When a journalist from Le Nouvel Observateur pointed out that ""Shadows and Fog"" has a scene with a mother and child begging that seems to be stolen from Chaplin, Mr Allen retorted that Chaplin's scene was set in the daytime and his is set at night.
It is possible that the self-quotations and unacknowleged borrowings may eventually start to pall on European filmgoers; but then again Mr Allen must be aware that European fans of the popular arts feel that once a star has reached a certain level of fame, whatever he does is worthy of admiration. In Europe, Orson Welles was always the creator of ""Citizen Kane"", not the disappointing young genius who never fulfilled his promise, as many Americans saw him. Mr Allen, as L'Express noted, crossed the threshold of fame years ago. Nothing he can do now, it seems, will hurt the Woody image in the European mind."

Born in Paris in 1955, he gave his first recital five years later. As well as attending the Julliard School, he was also a humanities major at Harvard. After years of playing with the world's great orchestras, in the course of which he won five Grammy awards, he recenty recorded an album, ""Hush"", with a jazz vocalist, Bobby McFerrin. In Cleveland recently to play with the Ohio Symphony, he talked to The Economist
You have said that you chose the cello, as a child, because it was the biggest instrument. Why is it still your favourite today?
Because the cello has the exact range of the human voice, from basso profundo to soprano. So, in that sense, it's a very human instrument. It has a fantastic range.
Is there any other instrument you wish you had taken up?
I wish I could have played the piano and played the saxophone better. Electronic music fascinates me, too. People keep doing interesting things all the time. Another favourite instrument is the shakuhachi, a Japanese flute. Each of those instruments--saxophone, piano and shakuhachi--has such a unique sound and world of possibilities.
Do you feel overshadowed by pop music or contemporary musicians? Do you feel that classical musicians get the attention they deserve?
If you look at statistics, you might say classical music did not exist. But the essence of classical music is to communicate something, and if you reach one person, then you've done your job.
There's something special about developing a rapport with an audience. I never repeat a concert. Every time it's different, and the composition of the audience will be slightly different too. The best kind of concerts are those in which you're sharing something with an audience. Not 'Hey, look at me, I'm a great cellist, see how fast I can play.' You're sharing. When those moments happen, you get an out-of-body experience, and you feel that life is worth living. And if the people meet you half-way, you've done your job. The best audiences are trying to receive something, instead of saying 'Prove to me what you can do.'
What do you see as your strengths and weaknesses?
I think they change from time to time. I work on developing as many kind of sounds as possible. If you're trying to do something really well, you're constantly questioning yourself. Self-doubt, I think, is what it is. To renew and reaffirm what you do, you have to do it on a daily basis. I have to find a reason for myself and say, why am I in Akron? If I say I'm in Akron because I've been asked to do something and I'm going to get paid for it, that doesn't work. That's death. You have to identify a weakness and turn that into a strength. If I feel unbelievably well-prepared and I say I will turn that into a great concert, it won't happen. You need to constantly check out when a strength becomes a weakness.
What do you check before you go on stage?
It's the same for any musician. Your form. Are you trying to give a perfect concert, or are you trying to communicate? Nobody wants to be a fool and mess it up, but sometimes you have to mess it up and make a fool out of yourself to communicate something. What I tell myself is to be in the world of the piece I'm playing. If I mess up technically, it's fine because there's a more important thing I have to do. Sometimes you have to allow yourself to fail.
Where do you think classical music is going?
Let me talk about America first. In the States, the arts are viewed as a luxury instead of a necessity. I would like to make a claim that the arts are embraced by people who care enough, who want to be curious about themselves. So in that sense, I don't agree that they're a luxury. And I do feel that what gets produced reflects the soul of the country. What is the soul of the country? Well, I don't know. I try to figure out what keeps us going. Sometimes it's the irrational rather than the rational thing that keep us going.
Do you see new voices coming from China, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union because of the political changes?
Absolutely. But there is a danger as well as a benefit. A lot of people from those regions want to become westernised too quickly. There is a lot of opporunity to communicate and learn new things and the possibility of an explosion of talent in these places. But I have to say that, in music, talent is not just the work of one person. It requires a lot of nurturing. What I do today is because a lot of people such as good advisers, mentors and family have helped me along the way. I think depth in music comes from a community. If everyone is moving around, those communities might disintegrate.
Does technology have a place in classical music?
I've always been excited by the latest developments in technology. From Bach to Beethoven, they were fascinated by it. Of course technology has a place. If music is a living part of our culture, it has to change and that includes the equipment. You can have a backlash and people can say, 'Let's go back to original instruments', but that would be a reverse technological development. People say we want to hear truth, but truth in 1991 is different. I've been involved with Todd Machover, a composer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's media lab, who hooked up a cello to a computer. With it, you can make a cello sound like 60 cellos. I did a piece at Tanglewood with that set-up, and we did it again in Tokyo. There are lots and lots of possibilities. So we have to have the courage to go forth.
When you're at home in Boston, what kind of music do you listen to?
Mostly to tapes people send me. I listen to all kinds of music, like the Turtle Island Quartet. I love good jazz, too: John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Art Tatum. Andre Previn, who I like a lot, went back to doing jazz. I try to keep an ear out for other things. I don't listen to cello music."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224140217/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/1?accountid=14657,"The earth spins, the sun shines, prices rise: two generations have grown up believing that inflation is an unalterable fact of life. No wonder. A dollar today is worth only 13 cents in 1945 money; a pound is worth only 6p. Much of the damage was done in the 1970s and early 1980s, and much has improved since then. In the OECD countries inflation is now hovering around its 1960s level of 3-4%. That gives governments the best chance they have had for decades to kill it off and achieve price stability. Sadly, they may fluff it.
Price stability is not as extraordinary as it sounds. It does not mean that all prices stay the same: some will fall, others rise, but the average price level remains constant. Anyway, inflation, in the sense of continuously rising prices, is historically the exception, not the rule. On the eve of the first world war, prices in Britain were on average no higher than at the time of the fire of London in 1666 (see page 68). (Page 68 omitted). During those 250 years, the longest unbroken run of rising prices was six years. Since 1946, by contrast, prices in Britain have risen every year, and the same is true of virtually every other OECD country.
It is easy to say that double-digit inflation is bad, but harder to agree on the ideal rate. Should governments aim for 5%, 3% or 0%? Some claim that the extra benefits of zero inflation are tiny and would be outweighed by the short-term cost--lost output, lost jobs--of pushing inflation lower. A little bit of inflation, they say, acts like a lubricant, helping relative prices and wages to adjust more efficiently, since all wages and most prices are hard to cut in absolute terms. But a little inflation sounds like ""a little drink"" for an alcoholic. It can too easily accelerate. That is the lessen of the past 40 years--that, and the fact that the economies with the lowest inflation have tended to be the ones with the least unemployment. Beyond the short term governments cannot choose to have a bit faster growth in exchange for a bit more inflation. The choice does not exist.
THE VIRTUE OF ZERO
The rewards of reducing inflation from 5% to 0% may be smaller than those from crunching inflation from 5,000% to 5%, but they are still highly desirable. The best inflation rate is one that least affects the behaviour of companies, investors, shoppers and workers. That means zero, because anything higher interferes with the most fundamental function of prices--their ability to provide information about relative scarcities. If prices in general are rising by 5% a year, the fact that the price of one particular product rises by 8% goes largely unnoticed. Yet that product's relative 3% increase ought to attract the attention of potential new producers, and to encourage buyers to look elsewhere--in short, to set in train the changes that maximise economic efficiency. It would do that if the 3% rise was like a hillock in an otherwise flat landscape; but, in the mountains of generalised inflation, nobody notices a crag. Even with an annual inflation rate of 5%, the general price level doubles every 14 years, obscuring changes in relative prices.
Now imagine a world without inflation. Once it was believable, it would transform the way people behave. Companies would be confident about borrowing long-term money, and lenders confident about providing it. Real interest rates would fall. Firms would invest more, because the probable pay-out would be clearer; the same would be true of individuals, investing time and money on their education. Governments could budget for infrastructural projects, knowing that their plans would not be derailed by unexpected surges in prices. In general, everyone would think more about the long term, because the long term would be easier to see. Today short-termism is rightly thought to be a big cause of slow productivity growth. Short-termism is nothing more than inflation's child.
Could OECD countries return to price stability? Some forces are working to push inflation lower than it is now. One example: services, which account for roughly half the weighting in consumer-price indices, are increasingly subject to the competition that has helped to restrain the prices of manufactured goods. More and more services can be traded internationally, using technology that should produce big increases in productivity.
A longer-term reason for optimism is votes. Inflation redistributes income and wealth: from creditors to debtors, and from those on fixed incomes to wage earners. During the past three decades, most voters who were workers were protected from inflation, as wages typically outpaced prices. And most voter-borrowers gained, because inflation eroded the real burden of their debts. But tomorrow's voters will be older. Whereas overborrowed yuppies benefit from inflation; pensioners, who have paid off their mortgages and are living off fixed incomes and saving, lose out; few pensions are fully indexed for inflation. By 2010 roughly a third of voters in Japan and many European countries will be aged over 60, compared with 20-25% in the 1980s. Add in those between 50 and 60, who are nearing retirement, an for the first time in modern history half the voters in these countries may gain from stable prices.
If more voters want it, will governments do it? Now the doubts creep in. As a minimum, there are three policy rules for price stability. Governments must abandon exchange-rate depreciation. Budget deficits must be small. And monetary policy must be run by an independent central bank whose sole goal is price stability.
On exchange rates, most OECD governments are on the right track. Only the largest economies--America and, perhaps, Japan--seem able to devalue the external value of their currency without having the effects rush through to devalue its internal value as well. On budget deficits, though, the picture is much less reassuring. There is nothing wrong with deficits in a recession, provided they are balanced during a full cycle. But too few governments observe that proviso. Their habitual deficits keep interest rates unnecessarily high and are often allowed to seep through into faster monetary growth.
The danger of seepage is particularly serious when central banks can be ordered around by politicians. That has been the pattern, and the cause, of the past three inflationary decades, so thank heavens it is starting to change. A few governments are handing over the monetary reins to independent central banks, shielded from politicians and charged with the statutory goal of price stability. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (probably the most independent of all) and the Bank of Canada both have explicit targets to reduce inflation to 2% or less; not by coincidence, New Zealand now has the lowest inflation rate in the world. The Bank of Japan also seems committed to an informal goal of 2%, and has shaken off its traditional subservience to the Ministry of Finance.
In Europe most governments have lashed their currencies and hence their monetary policies to the independent Bundesbank. True, Germany's own inflation has jumped to unGermanic heights as a result of unification, but the Bundesbank's medium-term resolve to fight inflation is not in doubt. And if there is to be a single currency in Europe, governments have agreed that the European central bank will be independent and have price stability as its prime goal.
This leaves a glaring exception: America. It has had ten years of huge budget deficits, in boom times and in bad. Most of its politicians still reckon that 4-5% inflation is fine--and they may get away with that view, because America's population is ageing less rapidly than those of other OECD countries, so inflation may not be so unpopular. Worse, American policymakers still believe there is a long-term trade-off between unemployment and inflation, so they clamour for lower interest rates whenever the economy seems to slow. America's underlying rate of inflation (4%) is similar to Germany's, yet short-term interest rates in America are less than half the German level. America risks being left behind on the road to price stability. If so, the dollar is doomed to long-term decline.
Does it matter to the rest of the OECD if the biggest economy eschews price stability? Much less than it used to. In the days of fixed exchange rates, America could export its inflation to other countries. When it decided to fight a war in Vietnam while building a Great Society at home, it started the inflationary virus that others could not escape. With floating exchange rates, however, America cannot infect others. Because it is so big, an inflationary America would still cause instability in financial markets, which would make life awkward for others. But if they stuck to the three minimum rules for killing inflation, they would win through.
However, even independent central banks can make mistakes in controlling inflation, as Switzerland has painfully proved in the past few years. Which leads to a fourth, overriding rule: the only way countries can guarantee price stability is by tying their monetary policy to an anchor which human being cannot shift. In the 18th and 19th centuries, when a unit of currency was redeemable for a fixed weight of gold, money supplies automatically had to adjust in line with the value of old.
A return to the gold standard is impractical and undesirable. Any market in a single commodity can be rigged by governments, and its price is prone to be buffeted around by strikes in South Africa and other random events. But the principle of a commodity anchor is an excellent one, and the modern version of the old standard would be to define a unit of currency in terms of a fixed basket of goods. Governments would undertake to redeem their paper money by offering to supply the goods in the basket, thereby guaranteeing the purchasing power of the currency. That, by definition, would mean the end of inflation."

Twice it has driven them from the campaign altogether, and twice so weakened them that they lost the ensuing election. Patrick Buchanan's victorious defeat by George Bush puts him alongside Estes Kefauver, Gene McCarthy, Ronald Reagan and Edward Kennedy, all of whom won or narrowly lost New Hampshire primaries against incumbent presidents. That a professional television bear-baiter, with the help of his sister, a few friends and money from his fans could in just ten weeks launch an attack so effective as to take 37% of the Republican vote from George Bush is astounding.
But probably not fatal. Mr Buchanan is still no more likely to win the nomination, or the presidency, than Kefauver, Mr McCarthy, Mr Reagan (in 1976) or Mr Kennedy. His margin of defeat, 16 points, was greater than any of theirs (see page 21). (Page 21 omitted). He probably lacks the money and the helpers to thrive in other primaries. His message--that Mr Bush had promised the people of New Hampshire not to raise their taxes, then raised them; ignored the state for four years and then returned, in a recession, begging for votes--will not work so well elsewhere. Mr Bush's tactics had been not to dignify Mr Buchanan's challenge by mentioning his name or attacking him in person. The loves will now come off. To borrow a phrase from a former governor of New Hampshire, pit-bull will replace pussy cat.
There is, however, a more worrying lesson from history. Mr McCarthy's close defeat by Lyndon Johnson in 1968 heralded the splitting of the Democrats over Vietnam. Mr Buchanan threatens to split the Republicans, over any of four issues: taxes, race, abortion and foreign policy. Georgia's primary on March 3rd will provide the first test of whether Mr Bush's signature of a civil-rights bill last year has hurt him as much in the south as his tax increase did in New Hampshire. But on taxes, race and abortion, Mr Bush is prepared to sound as Buchanan-like as necessary to keep his party united.
It is on foreign policy that a real split looms. Examine Mr Buchanan's record. He does not really care about taxes; he came late to voodoo economics. He does not really care about civil rights, though he has made embarrassing remarks about Jews, immigration and fascism. What he cares about is foreign policy. He does not believe in keeping troops in Europe, in foreign aid (""international welfare""), in the World Bank, in waging war on Saddam Hussein, in Israel, in the United Nations, in free trade, in keeping on good terms with China (""an 85-year-old, chain-smoking, communist dwarf"" he called Deng Xiaoping). Taxes and civil rights are his stalking horses, but nationalism is his creed. It was internationalism that split the Republicans, until anti-communism gave it 40 years of unity.
Internationalism is what Mr Bush, too, cares about. He wants America to be out in the world, promoting freedom, democracy and trade. The Republicans now have the old choice they had before anti-communism: between the Buchanan win of the party that last held influence under Robert Taft, and the Bush win that has held sway since Eisenhower.
Even if Mr Bush holds the party together, and wins its nomination, his will be a tarnished prize for two reasons. First, he will have spent the primary season wooing his right win, which risks offending moderate Republican and independent voters, rather than actin presidential. Second, the Democrats have scented blood. They have been treated to a vivid demonstration of how effective it is merely to replay, ad nauseam, recordings of ""Read my lips: no new taxes."" For the battle with the Democrats in the autumn will not be about isolationism, but about economics.
True, the Democratic Party has for years had its own ""isolationist"" problem, of trade protectionists. But the best news from New Hampshire for the Democrats was the consignment to the out-tray of its protectionists, Tom Harkin and Bob Kerrey. Just as an old split yawns in the Republican coalition, the recent split on trade seems to close in the Democratic one.
THE WORLD'S DREAM TICKET
Paul Tsongas, who has entered all his political races as an unfancied outsider and has always won, did so again. But, as with the Republicans, it is the man who came second who benefits most. Mr Tsongas's triumph has been so overshadowed by Mr Buchanan that he may not get the publicity bounce in other primaries that can make up for lack of organisation and money. Bill Clinton, on the other hand, having done marginally better than recent expectations, can now recover the tag of ""electability"". Assuming that southerners are as sanguine about his personal life and military career as New Hampshire Democrats were, he can now use his organisation and money to defeat Mr Tsongas in the south and secure the nomination.
It could be a Democrats' dream. They have a moderate, southern, front-runner to pit against a wounded president compelled to guard his right flank. That is the world's dream, too: a contest for the White House between two internationalist free-traders. Unless there are more surprises in store."

That commonsense principle stops United Nations soldiers from being offered for target practice in wars they cannot halt or in truces so fragile that their main task is to escape alive. Why then is the United Nations proposing to send more than 13,000 peacekeepers to Yugoslavia before all sides in the civil war have agreed unequivocally to the UN's ceasefire plan?
Though aware of the risks of a Balkan quagmire, the UN secretary-general, Boutros Boutros Ghali, and his special envoy in Yugoslavia, Cyrus Vance, believe that this time there is a real chance for peace. The war has killed around 5,000 Yugoslavs and caused 500,000 to leave their homes. Most Croats and Serbs are sick of it. Their elected leaders, Franjo Tudjman in Croatia and Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia, appear to reckon that more fighting is not worth the cost. That seems to be the view as well of the unelected generals who sent Yugoslavia's army to punish Croatia's secession. Opposition to the ceasefire plan among Serb separatists in Croatia is also weakening.
A more cautious secretary-general might have waited before urging the Security Council to act. The disputes that led to this war have not been settled. Croats have lost, by their reckoning, a third of their land. The Serbs and the generals have lost a united Yugoslavia. Though the Serbs, the Croats and the generals have formally accepted the UN plan, not all politicians and soldiers on each side see an advantage in peace.
Yet delay, too, could be dangerous. A winter ceasefire, the 15th since the war began in July last year, has held for seven weeks, but the arrival of spring could bring the guns out again. The purpose in sending peacekeepers now is to consolidate the ceasefire, to push Mr Tudjman and Mr Milosevic further towards peace and to deter the wild men on their flag from trying to restart the violence. The plan requires 10,000 soldiers and 3,000 support troops to police the three Serb enclaves in Croatia. The army is to withdraw and all militias are to be disarmed. Local administration will stay mainly Serb, under the eye of the UN, pending a negotiated settlement. The job is difficult. A lot of its success will depend on how the UN troops are chosen and led. One of the worst outcomes, and not just for Yugoslavia, would be for it to limp off in failure.
IF AT FIRST...
To prevent such a defeat, two thing are necessary. One is to reopen peace talks. The European conference, currently suspended, would be the obvious forum, if the Serbs are really willing to co-operate. But the form matters less than the substance. The essential is for outside powers, whether through the Community or the UN, to put maximum pressure on both sides to start negotiations for a lasting settlement.
Reaching agreement will not be easy. Geography does not make for a straightforward re-drawing of maps. Bosnia's claims to independence have to be answered without provoking an explosion from its Serbs. That said, both Croatia and Serbia have an interest in peace. Their economies, which depend on each other, are in ruins. The Croats are better armed than last autumn: a new war would be less one-sided. Neither Croats nor Serbs have a reasonable hope of getting all they ask. If they face facts, the Croats, in the end, will be wise to accept the loss of land, the Serbs the end of Yugoslavia.
As reason and fact-facing are in short supply among the combatants, both the diplomats and peacekeepers have to assume that the job will be a long one. The second essential, if peacekeepers are to avoid a Balkan humiliation, is to make it clear from the outset that they will not be scared off. Enough troops need to be sent to do the job. If 13,000 is too few--and some soldiers who know about truce-monitoring think it is--then reinforcements may be in order. As they can expect to be shot at, they need to be well enough armed to defend themselves. Peacekeeping is not cheap. The proposed force is likely to cost at least $400m a year.
Peace in Yugoslavia is not all that hangs on the success of this operation. Many people are hoping for an expansion of UN peacekeeping across the world and for better ways to conduct and finance it. The proposed UN Protection Force for Yugoslavia (and a similar operation in Cambodia) are the biggest ventures of this kind since the Congo operation in 1960-64. Failure would be felt far beyond the borders of Yugoslavia."

That is what Yitzhak Rabin, now leader again of Israel's Labour Party, once said of Israel's having added the Shia Muslims of southern Lebanon to its already impressive list of enemies. It did not have to. When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, many southern Lebanese welcomed the departure of the Palestine Liberation organisation, whose gunmen had taken to lording it over them. But, by overstaying their welcome, the Israelis soon turned themselves into just another bunch of occupiers. Last weekend, with the assassination of Sheikh Abbas Mussawi of Hezbollah, Lebanon's ""Party of God"", Israel compounded the error. It has surely cemented another stone into the wall of hatred that divides the Jewish state from its neighbours.
You would need an onion to shed tears for the murdered sheikh. He ran an organisation steeped in murder and kidnapping, which still says that destroying Israel is the only solution to the troubles of the Middle East. Hezbollah had declared itself to be in a state of war with Israel, and had acted accordingly. Morally, Israel's killing of its leader was not discernibly different from the American raid on Colonel Qaddafi's compound in Tripoli in 1986, which claimed a lot more innocent lives. But the chief objection to Israel's action is less that it was unlawful, more that it was unwise. By intensifying the fight in southern Lebanon it has added to that wall of hatred just when American diplomacy has given Israel a marvellous opportunity to knock it down.
NOBODY TO TALK TO BUT THE ENEMY
Although they have slipped from the headlines, the peace talks that started in Madrid last October are still alive, and livelier than their critics allow. Since Madrid, Israel has gone twice to Washington for bilateral talks with the Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese; and once to Moscow to meet a whole range of Arab states--including Saudi Arabia--that used to deny its right to exist. Barring last-minute upsets, a third round of bilateral talks is planned in Washington. If peace has not leapt like a lusty babe from these early contacts, nobody had a right to expect it to. For a notion of the time such things can take, it is worth remembering that nearly five years passed between Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem and the completion of Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai peninsula. And Israel did not really want Sinai.
It does want the West Bank and the Golan Heights. The talking since Madrid has consisted mainly of Syria demanding the Golan's return, with Israel saying no, and the Palestinians demanding to be treated as a state-in-waiting, with the Israelis refusing that as well. Lebanon does what the Syrians tell it, and King Hussein of Jordan is wisely leaving all the painful decisions to the Palestinians. At each Israeli rebuff, the Arabs complain to the talks' American sponsors, who send them back to the negotiating table with instructions to persevere. It is hardly inspiring stuff, but even these arid exchanges serve a purpose. Each encounter makes it plainer to the Arabs that they have to bargain for the recovery of their land; that the United States will not instantly wrest all of it back on their behalf. Meanwhile Israelis are learning that the Arab world has dropped its old prohibition on dealings with Israel. For too long, the price Israel was prepared to pay for peace had been a moot question. Now it is abruptly real.
Valuable as they are, these changes in mood and attitude are not enough. Many Arabs are dismayed at the thought that Israel has already benefited disproportionately from the diplomacy. Whereas the Arabs have half-played their peace card, Israel shows no sign of putting any land on the table. Indeed, hardly a week goes by without Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, declaring publicly that the occupied territories are part of its eternal patrimony and that it will never give them up. Since territorial compromise is supposed by everyone except Israel to be at the heart of the present negotiation, how can a breakthrough come? The answer is: in stages. Israel's present government will sin away no territory. But it is obliged by its peace treaty with Egypt to offer an interim period of self-government, or ""autonomy"", to the Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza, and to start talking about the final status of those places three years after the period of self-government begins. For the moment Mr Shamir is living up to this obligation. In January his righter-wing coalition partners threatened to quit the government if he presented Israel's autonomy ideas in Washington. He did so and his partners resigned, precipitating early elections.
Mr Shamir did not behave this way out of enthusiasm for autonomy but because he had to. The popularity of the peace talks among Israelis in general, and anxiety about his relationship with America, simply outweighed the threat from his right. For peace to prosper, the talks must remain popular in Israel, and the United States--despite its own preoccupying election--must keep up its pressure on Israel's government.
The best way to keep Israeli public opinion on track is for the Palestinians to refrain from attacks such as last weekend's axe-murder of three soldiers in northern Israel. They are the Likud's best recruiting-sergeant. As for American pressure on Mr Shamir, it is already more intense than the Arabs are willing to acknowledge. By withholding $10 billion in loan guarantees, the Bush administration is pushing Israel towards a freeze on further Jewish colonisation of the occupied territories. Without a freeze, no Palestinian will believe that autonomy can lead on to a proper homeland in the West Bank and Gaza.
Mr Shamir, a lifelong Greater Israeli, may refuse to buckle. In which case he will have to explain to Israel's voters why they must sacrifice their prosperity, antagonise their closest ally and give up the chance to attract many more Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union--all for a policy that will almost certainly destroy the hope of peace. That would make Israel's mistakes in Lebanon fade into insignificance."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224138092/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/5?accountid=14657,"When the Saturn rockets thundered through the sky above Cape Kennedy, and small steps were making large ones for mankind, space travel stirred the blood. Now it just seems tedious. Space shuttles generally blast off with a minimum of fuss, getting less media coverage than when rounded by mishaps. Budgets climb as high as the hardware they pay for. The thing that does not soar as it once did is the human spirit. The excitement engendered by a new frontier is a noble part of what it is to be human; but so is the capacity to adapt to the new and take it for ranted. Though America's National Aeronautics and Space Administration has many problems--not least the fact that its administrator, Admiral Richard Truly, has just been fired (see page 83) none will be more damaging in the long run than a perception of NASA's miracles as just another way in which the government spends the people's money. (Page 83 omitted). For NASA has lost much of its capacity to inspire.
To stress this is not to play down NASA's other weaknesses. It is failing in most of its too numerous remits. It is all but giving up the exploration of the solar system. It is failing to encourage new commercial ventures. It is not spinning off useful new ideas at anything like the rate one might reasonably expect from a $15 billion-a-year high-technology enterprise. It is not winning a space race; no one is racing anymore. As a hand-out to the military-industrial complex, it is inefficient. And it is not making the president look good, which is the least a chap should expect for that sort of money.
The energy and talents of the NASA bureaucracy are spent on keeping two programmes going: the space shuttle and the space station. Both are hugely costly. Each space-shuttle flight costs between $400m and three or four times that much, depending how you count it. The space station has cost $6 billion without getting off the drawing-board. The programmes use rather old-fashioned technologies and are vital to nothing--except NASA's existence in its present form. Project Apollo and the struggle for survival that followed it taught NASA to have big engineering projects at its heart.
Outdated though it is, this belief has spread. The European Space Agency is also committed to large silly projects: a laboratory that will be part of the American-dominated space station and a mini-shuttle called Hermes. These, especially Hermes, are large enough to bankrupt it. The Japanese programme is as yet too small to have got into as big a mess as the others, but it shows signs of going the same way, with dreams of shuttles and independent space stations. The Russians are the only ones with different problems. They have a huge amount of experience, and stockpiles of rockets, too--though they may not have the ability to make them for much longer. They already have a space station. It is none too salubrious and a nightmare to keep ship-shape, but it still orbits a good 250 miles above the opposition. Russia has half-developed all sorts of intriguing gadgetry. And Russia has no money at all.
There lies a solution. Put the programmes together, and you have something big enough for the world to believe in and small enough for it to afford. Instead of spending $30 billion on an American-led space station, far better to expand and refit Russia's tatty. but extant Mir and send people to it on the shuttle. Get rid of Hermes, and instead get America, Europe and Russia working together on a small lifeboat for the expanded Mir. Let the world work together on hypersonic aircraft that might one day fly to orbit. Fair ideas, all of them. But getting together internationally makes sense only if the space agencies are unbundled first. Otherwise a world space programme will end up with today's bloat, only bigger.
A THOUSAND FLOWERS IN ORBIT
The problem the world over is that policy, programmes and operations are tied together, and the resulting gordian knot left in the hands of governments. This once made sense. In the 1960s NASA's goal was unprecedented and seen as an overriding national interest, so centralisation typical of a war economy made sense. And such technocracy was the norm in the Soviet Union. Now, though, it is an anachronism. No longer sustainable as a proxy for war, if space travel is to have a future it must be seen as an expression of peace. This requires diversity, for uniformity and centralisation are poor servants during peace. The world's goals could do with being united, but the means should be as many and various as possible.
The good thing about space having lost some of its mystique is that many companies and people now get things done there on a routine basis. Astronomers and telephone companies understand how to build, or buy and launch, satellites--as do generals and spies. Aerospace companies know how to build the hardware. Left to themselves, these various groups would keep using space, and would in time push back the limits of what was possible, a development that government should support in the interests of science, commerce and defence. But government also has a transcendent role proper to itself: to pay heed to the visions obscured from other eyes by profit-and-loss accounts. To want men and women to explore the worlds beyond the sky is an affirmation of the human spirit, valuable in and of itself. It is worth doing. But not, of course, at any price, not at the expense of more practical uses of space, and not in a manner that fails to live up to the idea's lofty ambitions.
Governments should set goals, but they should turn over the means to others as much as they can. Some reasonable goals today are a cheap, multi-purpose space station that can be expanded; a set of satellites to monitor the environment (already partly achieved); and a resumption of planetary exploration, with robots blazing trails that humans will follow later. With these goals set, industry can be given a wide brief to find ways to fulfil them. Internationalism should spring up unbidden, as teams form to make the most of the undoubted expertise spread around the world. When designs have been chosen, contractors can operate as well as build them. And the range of ways in which projects are supported can become broader--science agencies as well as space agencies could et into space research, while environmental agencies and transport departments also play a role. A less dirigiste space programme could free up the extraordinary technical enthusiasm there is for the task, and give the night skies back to dreams of glory."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224138156/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/6?accountid=14657,"he resignation of Karol Lutkowski, Poland's finance minister, on February 17th may mark the end of one of the bravest programmes of economic reform ever attempted. In Poland's ""big bang"" of January 1990, the government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki freed prices, devalued the zloty by 90%, opened the economy to international trade and sharply curtailed spending by the state. No other ex-communist country has done so much so quickly to escape its past. It was a gamble that deserved to succeed, and in many ways succeed it did. Yet Mr Lutkowski, a supporter of those earlier reforms, has quit because they are now in jeopardy (see page 41). (Page 41 omitted).
The new government of Jan Olszewski has said the pace must slow. Now the priorities will be to stimulate the economy with tax cuts, provide more subsidies for state-owned enterprises, and bring to an end ""the good climate for swindlers, crooks and thieves"". Mr Olszewksi says he will take care to keep public spending and borrowing under control, but such assurances ring hollow: the government will be unable to keep its new promises without relaxing its fiscal discipline. This change may seem entirely desirable to Poland's bewildered voters. Unfortunately, it is one they will come to regret.
A WINDOW CLOSES
For all their boldness, Poland's reformers have done too little, not too much--especially if the chance for radical change is ending. A crucial failure was that privatisation has been dispiritingly slow. Mr Mazowiecki said his government would privatise half the state-owned sector by 1993 and, by 1995, create a structure of ownership similar to that of a West European country. Two years and two prime ministers later, little has been done. A series of plans has come and one. One that looked promising--based on the free distribution of shares to all citizens--was delayed, then narrowed (to firms accounting for only 7% of industrial output), then delayed again.
The reformers' greatest success was in stopping the hyperinflation that raged in the closing months of 1989. Leszek Balcerowicz, Mr Mazowiecki's finance minister, did what many had thought impossible: he brought public spending under control, curbed the expansion of the money supply and stabilised the zloty. The result, inevitably, was a severe recession, though not as severe as the official figures implied. The fall in the output of state-owned industries was recorded in full; the rapid growth of small private firms could be seen, but not measured. Indeed, with unemployment at just over 2m (or 11% of the labour force) by the end of 1991, many western economists wondered whether Poland's recession had been as severe as it needed to be. With so much entrenched inefficiency, a bigger shake-out of labour seemed necessary.
Ideally, then, Poland's new government should have set itself two goals: first, to accelerate the privatisation programme and extend it to many more enterprises than the most recent plan envisaged; second, to consolidate Mr Balcerowicz's macroeconomic achievements by continuing to squeeze inflation and tighten the financial disciplines on the state. Both might have been consistent with a gradual recovery from the current slump, though further rises in unemployment would have been likely. What is certain, however, is that in the medium-term those efforts would have been rewarded--with more and better jobs, foreign investment and the promise of West European living standards.
That is now in doubt. Instead of accelerating the privatisation programme, the government seems likely to delay it again, and in the meantime to keep loss-making enterprises alive. Instead of building on Mr Balcerowicz's success against inflation, it plans to relax its fiscal and monetary grip, and has one so far as to advertise this fact in advance. The two dangers are closely linked. Support for failed enterprises will become more of a drain on the public purse than if is already. The government may disguise the cost through recourse to soft credit, but that would only add to the bad debts that threaten the Polish banking system. In any case, the prospect is higher inflation. And the message to would-be foreign investors is ""think again"".
If Poland's brave attempt to rebuild its economy does fail, history will be right to blame an electoral system that put 29 parties into parliament in the country's first free elections, and thus created a hopelessly weak democracy instead of the strong one Poland needed. But it will be wrong if it joins Poland's politicians in claming that the big bang went too far. The transition from communism to capitalism was never for the timid."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224163221/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/7?accountid=14657,"A fundamental shift in the way western aid donors treat Africa is in train. Witness a meeting held in Paris late last November, when 12 donor governments and international aid agencies, chaired by the World Bank, discussed aid to Kenya. In the past, such a meeting would have ended with an announcement of new aid and polite recommendations for economic-policy improvements. Not this time.
Instead, the donors called for ""early implementation of political reform to reinforce the benefits of economic structural change"". That meant ""greater pluralism, respect for human rights and firm action to deal with corruption"". Then came the bombshell. No new aid would be approved for six months. Meanwhile, the donors said, they would ""review progress"".
Never before had donors been so forceful--and so political. It worked. Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi, who had been denouncing multi-party democracy as an invitation to tribalism, hooliganism, banditry and treason, heard the message from Paris loud and clear. On December 3rd he accepted a shift toward a multi-party system; grumbling, maybe, but he did it.
The message was not addressed just to Kenya. Malawi's president-for-life, Kamuzu Banda, has been warned by EC governments that a donors' meeting this spring may treat his country like Kenya if he fails to meet their expectations. Britain has already cut its aid programme for Malawi from L10m ($18m) to L5m this year, in protest against Dr Banda's disregard of human rights and his tolerance of waste in government. With still better reason, France and Belgium have cut off aid to Zaire.
SOMETHING NEW
Five years ago, dictatorships proclaiming socialist theories, and applying the centralist part of them, prevailed in Africa, while donors pumped out conscience-salving loans without bothering too much what happened to the money. No loner. Africans have shown that they want multi-party democracy and are beginning to achieve it. Many African governments have decided that free-market policies are their most likely salvation. And western donors are demanding open politics and open markets in return for continued aid.
It all comes not before time--and the blame for what went wrong in Africa does not lie only there. The success of independence movements in the late 1950s and 1960s was accompanied by high hopes for democracy. But democracy is a late-grown and tender plant even in its European home. It formed little part of the colonial heritage. Rule in Africa was ""essentially one-party rule by the administering authority,"" says the Nigerian secretary-general of the (ex-British) Commonwealth, Emeka Anyaoku. Colonial officials had little use for the notion of ""loyal opposition"". Nor, remarks Mr Anyaoku, did Africa. ""I do not know of any African language whose political lexicon includes the concept of a 'leader of the loyal opposition'. Instead there is a clear concept of a political enemy.""
To make things worse, one bit of European culture that had taken firm root among the elite of the new Africa was socialism, 1950s-style: the conviction--not unknown, either, to far-from-socialist colonial officials--that governments must have their hands on the levers of economic power. Bad in itself, a collective hand on the levers also meant opportunities for individual fingers in the till. The stage was set for the mismanagement of the past 30 years.
Most of the might-have-been democracies soon fell under the unchallenged rule either of those who had led the fight against colonialism--leaders such as Ghana's Kwame (The Saviour) Nkrumah, an able man corrupted by power, or Tanzania's Julius (The Teacher) Nyerere, an honest one led astray by potty economic ideas--or of ambitious soldiers. Many rulers were neither able nor honest. Barely anywhere (Botswana and Mauritius are long-established exceptions) did democracy take root.
THE SLIDE OF THE STRONGMEN
Now it is doing so. Opposition leaders last year won elections in two former Portuguese colonies, the Cape Verde Islands and Sao Tome and Principe. In ex-British Zambia's presidential election last November, Kenneth Kaunda, who had ruled since 1964, lost to the opposition leader, Frederick Chiluba, and handed over gracefully.
In ex-French Senegal, the incumbent president won a fairly free election. The party of Gabon's President Omar Bongo, despite some ballot-stuffing, won only 59 of 120 seats in its election, but Mr Bongo obtained a majority by doing a deal with a small party. In many other former French colonies, however, one-time strongmen have lost power. Benin's Mathieu Kerekou lost an election to an opposition reformer, Nicephore Soglo. In Niger, the opposition obliged General Ali Saibou to hold a ""national conference"" on the country's future, and to transfer power to a prime minister from its own ranks until elections are held. Madagascar's President Didier Ratsiraka, facing mass demonstrations, accepted a coalition with the opposition--and the opposition leader as effective head of government--until an election is held, supposedly by the end of this year. In Mali, General Moussa Traore was deposed, after 23 years in power; elections are due on March 26th.
In Togo, however, there was a backlash. Soldiers tried last month to oust Joseph Koffigoh, a democrat who had been appointed prime minister by a national conference convened to decide the country's future, and who had taken executive power from the unloved General Gnassinbe Eyadema. Mr Koffigoh had to make concessions, but has hung on. He now heads a coalition in which the general wields influence. And in ex-French Congo, after General Denis Sassou-Nguesso, a repentant Marxist, had been eased out of power by a national conference, the prime minister, Andre Milongo, faced an army mutiny. He too survived.
MORE GOOD NEWS TO COME
Prospects for democracy this year look fairly bright. Nigeria's ruler, General Ibrahim Babagida, has held state elections with fair success (though electoral hanky-panky led to some being annulled). Primaries for a presidential election are due in August, the election itself in December. Ghana's ruler, Flight-Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings, has set up a committee to write a new constitution, which is due to be put to a referendum in April. Presidential and parliamentary elections are to be held near the end of this year.
Sierra Leone has approved, in a referendum, a return to multi-party democracy and is due to hold elections soon, though the country's ruler, General Joseph Momoh, has not yet set a date. He will probably be a candidate and be challenged by an opposition leader, Sallia Jusu. Tanzania's President Ali Mwinyi, observing what was happening next door in Kenya, has switched deftly from insisting on a one-party state to calling for multi-partyism. This will be approved by the rubber-stamp parliament in April, and elections due in 1995 may be brought forward. The president of Gambia, Sir Dawda Jawara, in office for 26 years, has announced that multi-party elections will be held in April. He will be a candidate, and will probably win, but the election will be strongly contested.
Cameroon's President Paul Biya has had to retreat in the face of 13 opposition parties demanding a national conference, but so far has conceded only the appointment of a commission to propose constitutional changes. However, a parliamentary election may be held this spring. Angola's first presidential and parliamentary elections are promised this year, probably in September, pitting President Jose Eduardo dos Santos against the rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi. Guinea-Bissau is seeing the start of a multi-party system. Burundi is to vote on a new democratic constitution in March, though progress will be slow if recent tribal violence continues. A transitional regime is meant to lead to multi-party democracy in Rwanda. But it too faces a long-running civil war in part of the country.
NOT EVERYWHERE, THOUGH
So far, so good, more or less. But strongmen rarely give up without a fight. Some are holding on to power the devious skill.
In Mauritania President Ould Taya was predictably declared the winner of a presidential election last month. Opposition parties claimed they had been robbed, and refused to take part in legislative elections due shortly. In Cote d'Ivoire Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the wily patriarch of black Africa, deployed all the power of the state last year to win 163 of 175 seats in parliament. In the remote Central African Republic, General Andre Kolingba is putting off demands for a national conference by evading meetings with the opposition. In Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta), Captain Blaise Compaore announced on November 5th a presidential election on December 1st. His rivals refused to take part. Mr Compaore was duly ""elected"".
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has stepped back from imposing a one-party state, but his way of government looks curiously like one. In Zaire wealthy President Mobutu Sese Seko, by encouraging the formation of several dozen parties, has done his best to divide his opponents. Finding that not enough, he recently suppressed the national conference which they had organised, and the latest demonstration against him in Kinshasa was put down last Sunday by troops, with many deaths.
And, alas, in Chad, Liberia, Ethiopia and wretched Somalia, the only real arbiter of power is the gun.
FED UP
Why the new trend? Africans have at last lost patience with their rulers. They are particularly angry about declining living standards, but also about arbitrary and bad government, corruption and a breakdown of law and order. Many members of the small middle class are government officials. Since most governments are short of cash, having been told by the IMF and World Bank to cut spending, these officials are underpaid or paid late. Unhappy and articulate--and often represented by militant trade unions--they demonstrate, they go on strike and they oblige the strongmen to convene national conferences. Among the demonstrators are people from the countryside who have been flooding into towns seeking (but rarely finding) a better life.
The strongmen were vulnerable. They could no longer blame the colonialists, who had gone home two or three decades ago. The blame lay close to home. Nor, after the collapse of communism, could any African leader say with a straight face that he favoured Marxism or state control of the economy. The collapse of communism affected the aid donors too. They were embarrassed to be seen backing freedom in Eastern Europe, while hobnobbing with dictators in Africa. And it freed them from the illusion that countries such as Zaire were strategic assets whose mineral wealth had to be saved from falling into communist hands. Mr Mobutu and his like became dispensable.
So the donors, already ""totally fed up"" with Africa's performance, according to a senior aid official, changed their tune. Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, laid the new approach on the line in mid-1990:
Countries which tend towards pluralism, public accountability, respect for the rule of law, human rights and market principles should be encouraged. Governments which persist with repressive policies, corrupt management and wasteful, discredited economic systems should not expect us to support their folly with scarce aid resources which could be used better elsewhere.
President Francois Mitterrand, speaking after a Franco-African summit in his country at about the same time, sent the same message. France would go on giving help, but
This traditional aid will be more tepid for regimes that behave in an authoritarian manner, without accepting the evolution toward democracy, and more enthusiastic for those who take this step bravely and go as far as they can.
There are limits to this change, however. Aid donors are now rightly emphasising the need for ""good government"" in a continent where government is often a shambles. They, and foreign investors, are inclined to overlook dictatorial tendencies in the rare regimes that can show economic success. Well-performing Ghana has for several years been the darling of the World Bank and western donors (though not of investors). All have turned a blind eye to Mr Rawlings's strongman act. Some sceptics indeed murmur that things might not be so great if the democrats ever got back: the last time, they were a disaster.
THE OTHER HALF OF THE STORY
The familiar trouble is that, though free politics and free-market economics go most happily together, one does not necessarily lead to the other, nor guarantee its success. Africa has as much work to do getting rid of--often well-intentioned--economic interventionism as in chasing out dictators.
The IMP has loan agreements wit 23 African governments. None has been carried through to completion and economic takeoff. The structural reforms that are needed, says the fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, are ""as far-reaching in economic culture as anything that is being undertaken in Eastern Europe or Latin America"". They are indeed. Africa's list of ""things to do"" is daunting. For example: balance the budget; make the docks, airports and public utilities work; close corrupt (and bankrupt) state banks and encourage private ones; privatise state enterprises; get rid of needless controls and licences; make the currency competitive; liberalise markets and labour laws; make if easy to set up a company; encourage the ""informal sector""; go for exported growth; don't treat investors, domestic or foreign, as predators, but allies, and go out and woo them.
That is a big adjustment. Yet it is one that must be made rapidly, says Mr Camdessus:
Good economies is good polities, and vice versa. A newly established democracy needs to establish, as quickly as possible, the basic framework for a viable economic system, and for this it needs very strong policies in its early days. Only in this way can a country create, in the minds of both the domestic population and the international community, confidence in its stability and long-term prospects.
Zambia's new President Chiluba has followed this advice and abolished subsidies. Will such daring democrats survive? If Latin American experience is any guide, they will have a bumpy ride, at best. People tend to accept painful policies more readily from elected governments than from dictators. But they also want results. And it takes time for adjustment programmes to work, still loner for foreign investment to start arriving. Even then, market forces or world economic conditions can upset high hopes. When Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, urged on by aid donors, boosted their cocoa exports, prices collapsed. Tanzania's push into cotton exports suffered much the same fate last year. And, increasingly important, rich countries are far from opening their doors freely to third-world manufactures.
Governments that follow Mr Camdessus's advice may well be booted out of office before their policies have borne fruit. ply much the same policies. If eventually the country concerned acquires a good economic record, and establishes a stable business environment, investment will start coming in, households will begin to feel slightly better off and voters will start reelecting their governments. That takes time. But it has been done in Latin America.
AN ETHNIC SOLUTION
The difficulty will be in getting from ""here"" to ""there"". There will be plenty of setbacks. And democracy--majority rule, but also fairness to minorities--is not a natural concept. Oligarchy is (yes, in Africa too: do not imagine the whole continent used to be run by warm-hearted conclaves of village elders). So is tribalism, and Africa (not alone) has plenty of it. It shapes politics everywhere in black Africa, and democracy could make it worse, so long as parties have a tribal basis.
That is why Kenya's President Moi would really prefer a one-party state, in the form of a carefully constructed tribal mosaic. As the leader of a small tribe, he fears domination by the more numerous Kikuyu and Luo. Nigeria's President Babangida has a different answer: a two-party state, with one party to the left of centre and the other to the right. These have been formed and seem to be multi-tribal. Whether such a tidy, soldierly arrangement can last is another matter. A better version might be a constitution allowing any number of parties but requiring them to demonstrate significant support in most regions of the country.
Yet Africa's journey towards democracy and sound economic policies has achieved a remarkable momentum. A historic opportunity is being seized. The remaining autocrats will be shifted only by the continued bravely of their opponents and some pushing by aid donors. Yet shifted they may well be. Then the really hard part will start: achieving widespread good government."

In the primary on February 18th, Patrick Buchanan and his bash-'em conservatism took 37% of the Republican vote, against George Bush's 53%. Mr Bush, as Mr Buchanan himself pointed out on the eve of the election, is no Johnson:. ""When he says he'll do anything to get re-elected, I take him at his word."" Even so, the harrying that Mr Bush received from Mr Buchanan in New Hampshire is the most humbling moment of his presidency.
What went wrong? Six weeks ago Mr Bush had seemed to have put together a formidable and pugnacious re-election team. Robert Mosbacher, the Campaign chairman and a former commerce secretary, had some of the richest business friends in the country. Robert Teeter, Fred Malek and Charles Black were all veterans of earlier campaigns. Jim Pinkerton, a White House staffer, won his spurs for the negative campaign in that demolished Michael Dukakis in 1988. He was set to work on Mr Buchanan's particularly indefensible past utterings, of which there are many.
Only three weeks ago the Bush team looked set to be nasty to Mr Buchanan, while ignoring the Democrats. Mr Buchanan's challenge, after all, was Republican treason, akin to attempted regicide. Inside the Republican court, the Bushmen argued, you had to get nasty with traitors. So they bought space on New Hampshire's radio and television stations and prepared to put on some anti-Buchanan commercials.
Then the Bush campaign fell oddly mute. Right-wing Republicans loyal to Mr Bush, including Bill Bennett (a former education secretary with a conservative, Irish-Catholic upbringing similar to Mr Buchanan's), had urged a change of course. They warned Mr Bush that, by attacking the Buchanan campaign, he risked splitting the Republican Party into its right and moderate wings. Mr Bush's place in the history books, they argued, would not be embellished if he won the soubriquet of a ""Rockefeller"" Republican. Mr Bush therefore could not bring himself to mention by name ""the other guy"", a habit he also used to employ against Mr Dukakis in 1988.
The result was drift. The president was warned by his handlers to steer clear of foreign policy, on which he is deemed to spend too much time. So, on the three occasions when Mr Bush visited New Hampshire, he was reduced to mouthing banalities about the economy (such as ""Message: I care""). Occasional sightings of the presidential cavalcade incongruously crossing the snowy valleys of New Hampshire heightened the other-worldliness of it all. Right-wing Republicans from Washington, dispatched to press the president's conservative credentials, neither impressed the fierce right-wingers of the state nor comforted the moderates. Mr Bush is now deciding just how ""negative"" to go in the south.
If Mr Bush was forbidden to campaign on the confident territory of his foreign policy, Mr Buchanan was happy to fight him on just that patch. True, Mr Buchanan's commercials were all about tax increases and Mr Bush's promises, past and present, of tax cuts and tax credits. But his speeches were as much about America's role in the world.
Mr Buchanan inveighs against Israel, China, the IMF--indeed, against any foreign state ""mainlining out of the Treasury"". He paints Mr Bush as the enemy of freedom--by refusing to recognise early enough the independence of the Baltic states and of Slovenia and Croatia, and by backing a corrupt regime in China.
CROSSING THE DELAWARE
Mr Buchanan's campaign is truly an insurgent one. His bid for the presidency is just ten weeks old. His campaign team, which consists of little more than himself, his ""baby sister"", Bay Buchanan, and a young lawyer and film-maker, Paul Erikson, was held together in New Hampshire with string and sealing wax. The question now is how much further it can surge.
The campaign's funding has a lot to do with it. Mr Buchanan has been able to draw upon unparalleled mailing lists. Direct-mail shots have provided him with much of his money, federal matching funds: with most of the rest. In New Hampshire, Mr Buchanan spent more than the president--and $1.7m on media alone. His campaign now expects $2m more in the next couple of weeks. Mr Buchanan will spend as much of that as allowed in the Georgia primary on March 3rd.
Georgia will make or break Mr Buchanan. Georgians strongly backed the Gulf war, which Mr Buchanan did not. Even peace-loving Jimmy Carter would make sure he was seen in quail-hunting gear. Mr Buchanan, for all the tales of his youthful street fights, has the look of one who has never lifted a water-pistol. Patriotic southerners like the warrior president; but they may also like Mr Buchanan's America-first rhetoric.
Newt Gingrich, a congressman from Georgia, described Mr Buchanan's success in New Hampshire as a ""primal scream"". Surveys of voters there confirm that most were voting against Mr Bush rather than for Mr Buchanan. But the Georgia economy is far more robust.
That leaves Mr Buchanan with one card with which he might try to trump Mr Bush--race. He has already denounced Mr Bush for signing a civil-rights act that he feels gives blacks quotas of jobs. In Georgia there will be many Republicans who respond to talk like that. Mr Buchanan is no crude racist. But then, before he came to New Hampshire, he had little sympathy for those who complained about their economic plight. Mr Buchanan admits experience has made him change. The more he tastes electoral success, the more he will change again."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136972/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/9?accountid=14657,"After everything that has happened--Gennifer Flowers, the Vietnam draft, the ice-hockey commercial, Iowa's caucuses and a bushel of debates--the result in the Democratic primary was exactly as predicted four months ago. For all but four weeks from early January, Paul Tsongas, a former Massachusetts senator whose home is just south of the New Hampshire border in Lowell, held a comfortable lead in the New Hampshire polls. For all but those four weeks, Bill Clinton, the governor of Arkansas, had run a strong second; the rest were nowhere. And so it proved.
Mr Tsongas received 35% of the near-record turnout; Mr Clinton 26%. Far behind those two, Bob Kerrey, a senator from Nebraska, pipped Tom Harkin, a senator from Iowa, by 12% to 10%. Jerry Brown, an ex-governor of California, won 9%.
Mr Tsongas, who entered the field when every other Democrat was too scared of George Bush, ran a fine campaign (see page 26), coming across as both honest and decent. (Page 26 omitted). But it was not a victory that depended solely on his character and policies. He unquestionably benefited from his local connections. The day after the vote, Mr Clinton claimed that he had beaten Mr Tsongas everywhere that was more than 15 miles from Lowell, and a quick look at the returns supports him.
Mr Tsongas beat Mr Clinton by 44% to 31% in Nashua, the main city of the south of the state. In some suburbs of Nashua, Mr Tsongas got more than 50% of the vote, Mr Clinton less than 20%. But further north; in Manchester, the main town of the state, the two men ran dead even, and in outlying towns and villages Mr Clinton won handily. Yet it was Mr Clinton who had, as one Republican consultant put it, two Harpoons stuck in him during the campaign--allegations of womanising and draft dodging. Conventional political wisdom had written him off; polls in the last few days of the race showed him from 11 to 20 points behind Mr Tsongas, and none gave him more than 21%.
In fact, it is likely that the late polls (all of which were moving averages of a few days' numbers) had been skewed by a particularly bad showing for Mr Clinton on Saturday 15th February. This dragged his average--and, crucially, voters' expectations--down. The polls also understated his performance in the last days of the campaign.
Mr Clinton's comeback was made of two components. The first was cash. In the wake of the draft-dodging allegations, he bought two 30-minute television programmes to let viewers quiz him about his record. Few asked him about the draft--exit polls showed fewer than 10% of New Hampshire voters bothered by Mr Clinton's private life, and some who did think the draft an issue still voted for him. He then distributed 20,000 videotapes of his pitch. Professionals think that he may have spent twice as much on ""paid"" media as Mr Tsongas.
But in New Hampshire, where the voters expect to meet the candidates, buying votes goes only so far. The second reason for Mr Clinton's comeback was that he is an inspiring stump speaker. Alone among Democrats in this field, he can both whip up a crowd of his own supporters and convince strangers that they have his full attention. Moreover, all the publicity about his private life made him something no other candidate was: a celebrity. The day before the vote he was being mobbed in shopping malls (so was his wife: by the end of the campaign people in New Hampshire were saying ""Hillary"" like they would say ""Jackie"").
No other candidate came close to the appeal of Mr Tsongas or Mr Clinton. Mr Harkin had been widely expected to bash other Democrats--and particularly Mr Clinton--in the final debate on February 16th. Instead, worried that his image was poor, he was sweet reason personified, and the debate was consequently dull. He came a dismal second-last. He now goes to South Dakota, whose primary is on February 25th, where he will meet Mr Tsongas and Mr Kerrey (Mr Clinton is on the ballot, but making no effort). Both Mr Harkin's and Mr Kerrey's camps privately say that only one of the two senators will survive their encounter in the northern plains; neither of them is so flush with cash that they can carry on if they lose there.
Mr Kerrey had an awful time in New Hampshire, switching from style to style--now tough, now tender--like Laurence Olivier on a bad day. He bickered with his handlers and in the last few days his team were praying for the end, ready to leave the state like greased lightning. Mr Brown, in contrast, did better than expected. When the history of 1992 comes to be written, his misjudgment of the race will deserve a paragraph. He started the campaign by coming across as a weird campaigner against corruption; he ended it by reminding voters of his not-insubstantial record as governor of California for eight years. If he had done that earlier, he might have finished third and then challenged the two front-runners.
Mr Tsongas and Mr Clinton now get ready for a duel at the primary in Maryland on March 3rd. By then Mr Tsongas should have swept the Maine caucuses; on the same day as Maryland Mr Clinton should win in Georgia, where he is endorsed by everyone of note save the shade of Scarlett O'Hara. But neither has an edge in Maryland. Mr Tsongas maybe able to tap into Baltimore's Greeks and the affluent Democrats of Washington's suburbs. Mr Clinton will hope to do well among blacks and on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay, culturally a part of the south.
Then it is on to ""Super Tuesday"" on March 10th, when Mr Kerrey, if he is still in the race, will fight Mr Clinton for Texas, and Mr Tsongas will battle him for Florida. Michael Dukakis, the original Greek from Massachusetts, won the Florida primary in 1988. History may yet repeat itself."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224155173/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/10?accountid=14657,"Suppose George Bush were to tell Americans that the recession which so obsesses them finished a year ago; he would be jeered across the land. Americans are in no mood to be told anything except that their economic condition is awful. But, though Mr Bush would be making a political blunder, he would be telling the truth.
A recession is conventionally defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP. That last happened last winter (see chart). (Chart omitted) It was a short dip by past standards, and a shallow one. The average post-1945 recession has lasted nine months and has knocked more than twice as much off economic growth.
But the recovery too seems short and shallow. Between April and September last year the American economy grew at an annual rate of 1.6%. It slowed to 0.3% for the rest of 1991; in the first quarter of this year growth could stop. In the year after the steep 1981-82 recession, by contrast, the economy shot back with real GDP growth of 3.6%.
Signs of resilience are still scarce. By the end of 1991 employers had shed all the jobs they created during the summer's brief recovery, not least in middle management. Unemployment is now at 7.1%. That scares white-collar workers, who were relatively unaffected by the blue-collar recession of a decade ago, when unemployment hit 10.8%.
Employment rolls often take a long time to improve in a recovery. So what worries economists now is the shortage of other encouraging signs. Indices of leading indicators are flat. Manufacturers' orders fell by 3.8% in December. Retail sales slumped in the last quarter of 1991. Producer prices fell by a steep 0.3% in January.
With little prospect of a giddy recovery, it is now fashionable to describe America's economic condition as a ""contained depression"". This expression is as meaningless as it is false, given that the United States is not even in recession. Yet it reinforces the sentiment that the govemment must ""do something"", which itself impedes recovery.
Take Mr Bush's package, presented last month to Congress, to ""get the economy moving"". One element of the package was a proposal to provide temporary tax breaks for investment. Few within the administration privately believed this would do more than bring planned investment forward to take advantage of the breaks. Equally, few foresaw that the proposal would, until it was passed, help to stop current investment in its tracks. In December orders for capital goods plummeted by nearly 17%. Speculation about Mr Bush's package almost certainly contributed to this.
More broadly, the cost ot ""doing something"" has added $50 billion to the current fiscal year's budget deficit, for a total of $400 billion, an indefensible 6.5% of forecast GDP. It is hard to think of a better way to erode the benefits of the Federal Reserve's easing of monetary policy over the past year--an easing for which Mr Bush has pushed hard.
The Fed's easier money will, other things staying equal, probably work. There are several signs that the housing market is picking up. And retail sales rose by 0.6% in January. Lower interest rates are also cutting companies' financing costs, so helping to repair tattered balance sheets. Corporate profits, which fell last year by a third, are now set to improve--particularly since companies are looking harder than ever at their productivity. On February 18th, moreover, the requirement that commercial banks leave reserves with the Fed was eased. This will encourage banks to start lending again.
None of which means a roaring recovery is imminent. Companies and consumers will need more time to shed debt. The steepest cuts in defence since the Vietnam war will depress the economy before they invigorate it. Yet on February 19th Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, was right to point out to Congress that the prospect of low inflation and low interest rates lays the ground for future prosperity. The high prices being demanded this past week in jittery bond markets are, in the face of a deficit ballooning once more, evidence that America is not there yet."

The temptations for those who run it is to go out in search of potential patients--and then to restrain and treat more of them for longer than justified. A series of revelations in Texas has revealed that such temptations are not always resisted.
National Medical Enterprises, a fast-growing; California-based, for-profit, stockmarket-traded hospital chain, began operating psychiatric hospitals in Texas in the 1980s. With employers and insurance companies increasingly adding psychiatric services, as well as alcohol and drug-abuse treatment to their policies, the prospects were good. But disturbing reports soon circulated about unethical practices at private psychiatric hospitals. In August last year Texas joined Virginia in specifically banning the payment of fees for the delivery of patients.
Undaunted, National Medical Enterprises--by 1991 one of the country's largest hospital-management companies, with nearly $4 billion in annual revenues--continued to fill Texas television screens with glossy commercials. But, as the Houston Chronicle reported in a detailed investigation, the reality behind the pretty commercials was anything but attractive. Not only were bounties allegedly being offered to police, probation officers and school counsellors who recommended patients, but international brokers were brining in Canadian patients, and other company representatives reportedly infiltrated Alcoholics Anonymous groups to solicit recruits.
The Chronicle series attracted widespread attention. When the first damaging disclosures appeared, National Medical Enterprises responded with a series of full-page advertisements protesting its innocence. But additional newspapers revelations (including a series by the Dallas Morning News) and hearing by the state Senate's interim committee on health and human services brought more horror stories to light. At a public hearing at Rice University in Houston, in the presence of Texas's governor, Ann Richards, a police chief testified how a 22-year-old woman, accompanying her four-year-old daughter, had been wrestled to the round, put in a straitjacket, and treated at an NME hospital. He said he and his officers frequent received calls for help from people wrongly detained at the hospital.
Alleging numerous violations of the new Texas statute against paid ""patient referrals"", the state attorney-general sued National Medical Enterprises and several smaller companies for millions of dollars for medical fraud and abuse, kickbacks, illegally recruiting patients and falsely billing a state compensation fund for crime victims. In December the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation instituted emergency rules to put an end to the worst reported abuses. Meanwhile, the Texas Senate interim committee has proposed a series of further reforms, including a ""whistle-blower"" law to protect employees reporting unethical practices. Public supervision of for-profit psychiatric institutions would be substantially increased.
While all this was going on in Texas, five other states, including New Jersey and Florida, and the federal government, launched their own investigations. Similar abuses were reported, for example, in California, home of many private-sector for-profit hospitals. Barbara Demming Lurie, head of the Los Angeles County patients' rights programme, told the Los Angeles Times that at one unidentified hospital she saw numerous patients' charges altered to improve reimbursement by insurance companies. Don Rockwell, director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute of the University of California at Los Angeles, said he knew of ""iffy criteria used to hospitalise patients, length of stay extended without good clinical reason, multiple [treatment] where one would be enough."""
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224158595/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/12?accountid=14657,"The politics of water in California is seldom easy to explain. In the same week that storms, floods and mudslides swept away houses in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the federal government cut off its supplies to California's farmers to save a rare fish. Refreshingly, this time there may be a positive twist: a new, more sensible water policy is in the pipeline.
At the heart of California's water problems is agriculture, which accounts for less than 5% of the state's gross product, but 85% of its water use. Farmers have cut back on some of their more extravagant habits such as flood irrigation, but they still grow thirsty crops like rice and alfalfa. And the farmers receive their water at subsidised prices, sometimes a tenth of the cost to the cities.
California's reservoirs are at only a third of their normal level. The torrential rain that fell on the coast ran off into the sea. Most of the state's water comes from snow in the Rockies and the Sierras--and is carried down by three huge public canals: the State Water Project, the Colorado River Project and the Central Valley Project (CVP). The CVP is run by the federal Bureau of Reclamation and carries water to the farms in the San Joaquin valley.
The federal government turned off the CVP to farmers for the first time in its 40-year history to save a race of the chinook salmon. The fish spawn just below the Shasta dam at the top of the Sacramento River. Their young die if the water gets too warm. That will happen if the water level behind the dam drops too low during summer. The bureau had been threatened with lawsuits under the Endangered Species Act. In a normal year, the CVP delivers 8m acre-feet (9.9 trillion litres) to farmers--roughly a third of the 27m acre-fret used for irrigation. This year it looks as if the farmers will receive 2m.
Already the farmers are up in arms, complaining that saving the salmon will cost $1 billion in lost crops. Environmentalists are suspicious of such claims. To begin with, the cut is not as universal as it looks: some farmers who own old water rights will get 50% of their normal ration. Last year the CVP gave the farmers only 25% of their ration and the State Water Project gave them nothing. Some farmers moved to less water-intensive crops; many pumped water from the huge aquifers under the valleys. This year as much as 10m acre-feet may be pumped out to make up for the shortfalls.
That is hardly a long-term solution. The good news is that the bureau's decision may prompt more water trading. Many farmers, remembering the infamous Owens Valley water-snatch by Los Angeles, are suspicious of deals that transfer water to the towns. But water trading is now common in other parts of the west. Indeed many Californian farmers might make more money from selling their water rights than selling their crops.
The reform most likely to benefit from the news is a bill in Congress sponsored by Senator Bill Bradley. It would allow trading on the federal CVP project--and also set aside some water for wildlife and the environment. John Seymour, California's Republican senator who is courting the agricultural lobby, wants to add a provision giving local water districts the power to veto transfers. Strangely, Los Angeles has backed Mr Seymour; it may now change sides.
The other attempt to encourage water trading is California's state water bank, stared last year as an experiment to cope with the drought. In 1991 it bought 820,000 acre-feet at $125 each; and sold nearly 400,000 acre feet at $175 (the unsold water was picked up by the State Water Project). Tom Graff at the Environmental Defence Fund points out that the bank would work better if it acted more like a broker than a principal--and allowed the market to set its own prices."

Are you listening?"" On cue, his supporters went wild in a display of old-fashioned Democratic revivalism.
But here is the paradox. It was not George Bush Mr Tsongas was calling from Manchester; it was the national establishment of his own party. With the honourable exception of Ron Brown, the chairman of the national party, Washington Democrats have been muttering for weeks that Mr Tsongas would not be a strong enough candidate to beat Mr Bush in November. Just a day before the primary, both George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, and Tom Foley, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, were all but openly encouraging other candidates to enter the race.
Why are Washington's Democrats so hostile to Mr Tsongas? The usual reasons given are that he has no ""charisma"" (a bit rich coming from Mr Foley and Mr Mitchell). He is said to be a ""regional"" candidate, whose Yankee vowels and funny name will not play outside New England. And there are murmured doubts about his health; Mr Tsongas is a recovered cancer patient. But there is another reason: his policies make the party establishment uncomfortable.
Mr Tsongas's 85-page pamphlet, ""A call to economic arms"" (200,000 copies now distributed), has plenty of Democratic conventional wisdom in it, plenty of swipes at what it is now fashionable to call the Reagan-Bush years. But it also hammers Democrats. It tells them that ""you cannot redistribute wealth that is never created"", calls for a ""marriage"" with corporate America and (like any Republican) slams ""tax and spend"" policies. It criticises trade unions; it calls for a cut in the capital-gains tax and relaxation of antitrust laws. At his victory party Mr Tsongas sounded just the same themes. Democrats, he said, cannot be ""pro-jobs and anti-business"" at the same time. The party's message, he continued, had to change; there could no more protectionism, no more Japan-bashing, no more class warfare. He admits to being influenced as much by sitting on company boards as by having been in the Senate.
THE OLD DEALERS
There are many Democrats who agree with all of this. But there are plenty in Washington who do not, seeing the historic shift in the party's focus for which Mr Tsongas is calling to be milk-and-water Republicanism. Trade unions may now be weaker than they have been for a century, but many Democrats still do not like offending their most loyal spear-carriers. Richard Gephardt, the favourite son of the House Democrats, keeps his ties to the unions strong. Opposition to a capital-gains-tax cut is an article of faith for many congressional Democrats; it was by defeating such a cut in 1989 that Mr Mitchell stamped his authority on the Senate.
The problem that those who dislike Mr Tsongas's policies have is this: there was a clear alternative to those policies on the ballot in New Hampshire, and Tom Harkin, that alternative's champion, was trounced. Mr Harkin is proudly protectionist; he ran commercials attacking Mr Tsongas and others for favouring tax-cuts for the rich; he promised jobs for all, and a New Deal-like programme of public works. There is no doubt about where his support came from; a Harkin party after the television debate on February 16th was full of beer-bellied men in union jackets. And it did him no good; he beat Jerry Brown, the oddball candidate in the field, by a whisker.
So those who think that Mr Tsongas's message will turn off the faithful have to shift their round. They have to say that Mr Harkin is not a particularly sympathetic candidate; that he comes across as tough and mean. But it is wishful to suppose that any other candidate could sell Mr Harkin's message much better than he did. The New Deal is old hat.
In fact, towards the end of the New Hampshire campaign, a more subtle attack on Mr Tsongas's policies was developed, and since its author was Bill Clinton, the governor of Arkansas who ran second to him, you will hear more of it. Mr Clinton's theme can be summed up as ""not by economics alone""; he will attack Mr Tsongas for assuming that economic growth is the solution to all of America's problems. Though as committed to economic growth as Mr Tsongas, Mr Clinton will say that he has more plans for education, for helping the underclass and poor families, for dealing with crime and the scourge of drugs than Mr Tsongas does.
Mr Tsongas can legitimately claim that this misrepresents his position. A commitment to economic growth, he would argue, is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a sensible Democratic platform. He will stress his environmental credentials (stronger than Mr Clinton's) to show that he is more than a corporate lawyer in the hands of big business.
But it remains the case that, while Mr Clinton can talk about non-economic issues and sound fervent, Mr Tsongas cannot. Perhaps the strangest event of the New Hampshire primary took place on February 11th, when Mr Tsongas gave a speech detailing his life and struggles and spoke of the need a ""spirituality"" in politics. He admitted that the speech was hard to give; it was even harder to listen to, When Mr Clinton speaks confidently of the need for a new sense of community in America, he gets people out of their seats; when Mr Tsongas speaks self-consciously of the need for a new spirituality, he gets people squirming uncomfortably in them. In a race between two good men, bet on the one able to have people cheering, not looking at their shoes."

Two of them involve North Korea. That is too few. The Korean peninsula is perhaps the most dangerous place on earth.
That was not supposed to be the theme of a meeting on February 19th-20th in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, between the prime ministers of North and South Korea. It was the sixth such meeting since September 1990, and marked the most significant step towards reconciliation since Korea was divided almost 50 years ago. Yet it left almost untouched the two greatest threats to stability on the peninsula: the North's nuclear-weapons programme and the impending struggle there to succeed the ""Great Leader"", Kim Il Sung.
There has been progress at all only because the fall of Soviet communism yanked the geopolitical rug from underneath the North, leaving it bereft of financial and military support. China's leaders still have a soft spot for their old comrade, Mr Kim; but these days they think more with their abacus than their hearts.
China's trade with South Korea last year was worth more than $2 billion, four or five times bigger than its trade with the North. China is not about to give diplomatic recognition to the South, but it has not hesitated to open air links, nor (late last month) to make a deal with the South for a big joint project to develop farming and mining in Manchuria, in northern China. To the South's annoyance, Japan has been talking to the North about normalising relations; but the Japanese would never go so far without America's agreement.
By December last year, the insular and rigid North had been forced to bend. Giving up its decades-long insistence that the South was a mere American puppet, it signed a non-aggression agreement on December 13th that implicitly recognised the South's legitimacy (as had the North's acceptance of separate seats at the UN in September). Then, on the last day of the year, the two Koreas signed an agreement to make their peninsula free from nuclear weapons.
The centrepiece of this week's meeting was an exchange of ratifications of these agreements. The South was hoping for more. President Roh Tae Woo, in his last year in office, has been longing for a summit with Mr Kim, both to secure his own place in history and to help his party in the parliamentary election in March and the presidential election late this year. As recently as February 5th, the president's men were hinting at a March summit. Just before this week's meeting they said the subject would not be brought up at all.
Other hopes also were disappointed. The South's businessmen have been eyeing the well-educated, disciplined and extremely low-wage workforce north of the armistice line. In January, Kim Woo Chong, the chairman of Daewoo, one of the South's big conglomerates, spent ten days in the North and agreed to consider investing in a textile plant there. Other southern conglomerates are interested in toys, oil, ship-repair and electronics assembly.
It is clear, after this week's deadlock in Pyongyang, that the South, for now, will no allow these plans to go forward. There was not even any progress on setting up the three North-South working groups--on political and economic co-operation and on military matters--that are supposed to put the December agreements into practice.
The reason is the North's nuclear-bomb programme. It is widely assumed that the North is preparing, at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, to reprocess weapons-grade plutonium. After coming under intense international pressure last autumn to open this and other plants for inspection, the North seemed to give way: first, by signing the December agreement with the South then in January (years late) a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The suspicion is that--despite a denial by the Great Leader in a 95-minute meeting with the South's prime minister on February 20th of any nuclear intent--the North is simply stalling. It now says that the IAEA agreement cannot be rubber-stamped by the North Korean parliament before April. A first inspection might come in October.
At this week's meeting the South pressed for earlier and tougher mutual inspections under the nuclear-renunciation agreement between the two countries. The North would agree only to meet again, in the border town of Panmunjom on February 27th, to talk about it. The South's prime minister said flatly that until there was progress on nuclear inspections the rest of the reconciliation package would not move forward ""even an inch"". Time is getting short. Within ""several months"", according to an American State Department official, the Yongbyon plant could be producing plutonium--and by next year the North could have a nuclear bomb or two.
If America and the South eventually decide they have to do something forceful to prevent this, they will have to reckon not just with the North's 1m-man army but with growing political instability there as well. Until recently, the assumption was that Kim Il Sung like all good communist dictators, would die with his jackboots on. But the evidence is mounting that he may hand over power early to his son, Kim Jong Il--perhaps as early as the elder Kim's 80th birthday, on April 15th.
In December, Kim the younger took over from his father as supreme commander of the armed forces. The preparations for young Kim's 50th birthday party, on February 16th, included tributes that were fawning even by North Korea's exceptional standards; a celebratory decree by his father raised everyone's wages by 43.4%. More tellingly, young Kim was once or twice referred to as ""Great Leader"", a title previously reserved for Kim Il Sung; and, for the first time ever, Kim Jong Il was given higher billing in a North Korean news item than his father was.
For all his faults, Kim Il Sung is a patriot whose revolutionary nationalism still commands respect in the party and army. Kim Jong Il, whose tastes are said to run more to terrorist bombs and film actresses, is thought to inspire no respect at all.
Resistance to him could be strengthened by economic hardship. In the late 1980s North Koreans visiting relations in Manchuria stared asking for food rather than radios and bicycles to take back home. Ethnic Koreans from China who have recently visited the North say it is close to famine. Not quite the kind of country you want to see with a finger on the nuclear trigger."

Already its reserves are the biggest of any country anywhere, let alone an island of only 20m people. But the money just keeps piling up, raked in by nearly 100,000 feverishly exporting Taiwanese companies. By the end of December it had reached $82.4 billion, up $4.36 billion from November.
The question is what to do with the money, apart from depositing it in different currencies and different banks around the world, or buying American debt. One answer is to flaunt it for reasons of foreign policy--using the promise of financial aid to pursuade small and indebted nations, such as Guinea-Bissau, to recognise Taiwan's government as the ""sole legitimate government of China"". Critics who say that this is silly can be reminded of the need to lessen Taiwan's diplomatic isolation in order to combat the threats of aggression from mainland China.
But other answers might still make more sense. On February 18th the central bank earmarked up to $10 billion for loans to local industry for a number of strategic applications. In the previous two years it had doled out less than $1 billion, through local banks, to help the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corporation buy a small American oil company and to help two computer manufacturers make foreign acquisitions.
Now, in addition to facilitating foreign mergers and acquisitions, the funds will help Taiwan towards a high-tech future, investing in advanced technology from opto-electronics, biotechnology and space-age materials to industrial robots. The money will also be available to invest in the government's colossal six-year plan, a $300 billion series of infrastructure, industrial and technology projects in which private industry has so far shown only lukewarm interest. There is talk, too, that $2 billion may be handed out to Taiwan Aerospace, the government-created fledgling aircraft-maker that is negotiating to buy a 40% stake in McDonnell Douglas's commercial aircraft business--precisely the kind of project that private banks might judge too risky.
None of this will turn the foreign reserves' mountain into a molehill. Booming exports and high interest rates are attracting a steady flow of ""hot money"" into Taiwan, which pushes up the New Taiwan dollar and attracts yet more money. The local currency has appreciated by 9% against the American dollar in the past six months alone. Pressed by influential industrialists, the central bank has been intervening massively in the Taipei foreign-exchange market to stop the NT dollar from rising to new highs. But, as incoming American dollars are converted to Taiwan dollars, so the money supply expands and inflation rises--to the impotent dismay of the central bank."

The latest, involving a firm called Sagawa Kyubin, is of this quality. Bribery on an unprecedented scale is being talked of. The careers of 100 politicians and more are said to be under threat.
Earlier scandals now seem likely to be eclipsed by Sagawa's, although they were important enough in their time. The Recruit scandal led to the downfall in 1989 of the then prime minister, Noboru Takeshita, ruined a dozen other leading figures in business and government, and cost the ruling Liberal Democrats the majority they had held in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) for 34 years. The Lockheed affair of 1976 culminated in a former prime minister, Kakuei Tanaka, being given a jail sentence. A scandal that emerged last month has still to run its course, but so far it has involved the arrest of a former cabinet minister, Fumio Abe, on charges of taking Y90m ($710,000) in bribes for favouring a steel-frame maker called Kyowa. The money involved in the Sagawa affair is more awesome--hundreds of billions of yen.
The company was started over 30 years ago in Kyoto with a handful of people and two bicycles. Today it is Japan's second largest parcel-delivery firm--with 25,000 employees, 14,000 lorries and sales last year of Y909 billion. The company's founder and chairman, Kiyoshi Sagawa, has the motto, ""Work twice as hard and get paid three times as much."" The company has been prosecuted frequently for breaking labour laws and transport regulations.
The police started to investigate the firm after a boardroom row last July became public. On February 13th investigators raided homes and offices and seized a mass of documents. Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of Sagawa's Tokyo subsidiary, and Jun Saotome, a former director, are accused of giving Y530 billion in loans and guarantees to a number of firms, with out seeking interest payments or collateral and knowing the money would never be repaid. Such ""gifts"" are illegal.
Several recipients of Sagawa's largesse were fronts for the Inagawa-kai, Japan's second largest crime syndicate. So far, Y114 billion of loans have been traced to gangland coffers. The generosity seems to have been for strong-arm favours that helped the delivery firm muscle into rival territory, acquire new routes and deal with uppity employees.
Having political friends seems to have helped Sagawa, too. Between them, they are said to have pocketed upwards of Y80 billion of Sagawa's cash. The firm lobbied to get the law on parcel delivery changed so it could operate nationally instead of just locally. The transport ministry liberalised the law in 1990. It is said that the firm was paying the salaries of several hundred personal assistants to members of the Diet. The police now have Mr Watanabe's diary, which apparently lists the various Diet offices on the payroll. Sagawa, it seems, used underworld friends to pay the politicians and keep the bribes secret. For the hapless, 14-week-old government of Kiichi Miyazawa this is yet another burden.
Shortly before his arrest, Mr Saotome claimed that politicians were coming to the firm's Tokyo offices ""almost every day"" to collect money. Yasuo Matsuzawa, the president of Heiwado Real Estate, who has been arrested for receiving illegal loans, says that some 130 Diet members were regular recipients of Sagawa's cash, and not all of them were from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Apparently, five senior politicians received more than Y5 billion apiece. Donations of more than Y1.5m a year are illegal, and anything more than Y1m has to be registered along with the contributor's name. Some of Japan's political bigwigs are about to be in hot water."

The Punjabis voted for a state legislature and for 13 seats in the national parliament. Counting of votes was still going on as The Economist went to press, but it was clear that in the villages, where most people live, the turnout had been poor. Millions of people locked themselves in their homes, refusing even to answer the door for far of being shot by Sikh separatists who had threatened to kill anyone who voted. Sikhs want an independent homeland called Khalistan, or Land of the Pure.
In the towns, where many Hindus live, there was a better turnout. All told, fewer than 30% of Punjab's 13m registered voters braved the militants and cast their ballots. In previous elections the turnout was more than 55%. An election official said that the figure was reasonable, as the electorate had been terrorised and all but one major Sikh party had boycotted the polls.
Apart from that party, the choices for the voters were the Congress Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which espouses Hindu nationalism, Janata Dal and the Bahujan Samaj Party, representing untouchables. On the eve of the poll, militants rounded up and shot 13 labourers as a warning to all. They had already shot several teachers and minor officials who normally man polling booths. No one bluffs in Punjab: more than 12,000 people have been killed there in the past five years.
Elections had been ordered in Punjab last June but were called off at the last minute after 24 candidates were gunned down. No candidate was killed this time. The government gave each two escort vehicles and 20 armed guards. Even so, many refused to campaign, leaving their supporters to put up a few posters here and there.
The Sikh party that did contest the election--a faction of the Akali Dal, once the most powerful political force in Punjab but now divided--is suspected of having a secret understanding with the Congress Party, which rules nationally. Its most prominent politician, a prince called Amarinder Singh, used to be in Congress and still has many friends there: His faction contested only three of the 13 parliamentary seats. As a result, and because its supporters came out in the towns, Congress was expected to do well when the vote was counted.
A substantial Congress success in the local legislature as well as for the parliamentary seats would be dismissed by some people as a nonsense in a state where the party is hated by most Sikhs. It was a Congress government that in 1984 Sent the army into the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' most holy place, to kill militants holed up there. Following Indira Gandhi's murder, the government was blamed for starting riots in which 3,000 Sikhs were killed in Delhi. Congress has never been forgiven by the Sikhs.
Has it been worth holding elections in Punjab if the results turn out to be unrepresentative? One answer is that the postponement of elections in Punjab did not solve anything either. Indeed, direct rule from Delhi has fuelled the claim that Punjabis are not allowed a fair say in their own affairs. No matter how unrepresentative the newly elected legislators may be, they will carry more moral authority than administrators from Delhi who have been helpless to stop the pillaging of Punjabi villages by both the militants and corrupt police. A flawed election, it is argued, is better than none."

Today they are backing the United Nations plan for a neutral Afghan government, and striving to develop economic ties with the newly independent secular governments of Central Asia.
All this is at speed. In December Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, sent his economics minister, Sardar Assef Ali, and a team of businessmen to examine the prospects for trade in Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kirgizia. Pakistan is planning to put ambassadors in all the Central Asian states. On February 16th and 17th, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan met his Iranian and Turkish counterparts in Tehran to invigorate the Economic Co-operation Organisation (ECO)--the sleepy association of the three countries formed 27 years ago--by inviting Azerbaijan, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kirgizia to join. Afghanistan, too, is a likely ECO member, once peace comes to that tortured land.
The diplomatic flurry is evidence that economics may have triumphed over ideology. General Zia ul Haq, who ruled Pakistan until his death in 1986, believed that the ""strategic depth"" his country needed in its confrontation with India was best achieved by building an Islamic block between the Arabian Sea and the Urals. But the resistance of Afghanistan's President Najibullah to the Pakistan-backed Afghan mujahideen, and the break-up of Soviet Central Asia into secular republics, have outdated Zia's policy. The men who now run Pakistan still believe in ""strategic depth"". But they have abandoned the idea of a block based on Islam for one based on trade.
At first glance its prospects look good. The Central Asian republics say that they want routes to the outside world via Pakistan. There is talk of Central Asian branches of Pakistani banks and hotels, of joint ventures in textiles and cement, of Pakistani help to develop tourism and English-language training, and of Tajikistan (which has a power surplus) selling electricity to power-hungry northern Pakistan. To get trade rolling, Mr Sardar Assef offered the republics long-term credits of between $10m and $30m each. Next month Pakistan International Airlines will fly once a week between Islamabad and Tashkent, the Uzbek capital just over an hour away.
But are Pakistan's businessmen right in seeing an historic opportunity to enter the markets of Central Asia and help build its infrastructure--much as they once did in the Arab states of the Gulf? They maybe too optimistic. For one thing, the Central Asians have little money. Their economies are still locked into Russia's; shifting the direction of trade from west to south would not be easy. Their language and history also incline them towards secular, pro-western Turkey (or in the case of Persian-speaking Tajikistan, to Iran) rather than Pakistan.
Moreover, Turkey and Iran, have already stolen a march on Pakistan. Richer Turkey is leading the field in deals with the Central Asian republics (and claims to have signed credit agreements with them worth $1 billion). Iran, which was quickest to open embassies in Central Asia, is making oil deals with Turkmenia and others, and is trying, through the newly founded Caspian Council (which links Iran, Turkmenia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia), to establish its hold on Central Asia. Meanwhile, Pakistan is effectively cut off from Central Asia by the instability in Afghanistan.
Pakistan's easiest access to Central Asia is across Afghanistan, either via Kabul and the Salang highway (a three-day drive) or via Kandahar and Herat. The easterly route up the Karakoram highway via Chinese Kashgar is mountainous; the westerly one through Iran is long. That is why Pakistan's hopes of competing with Turkey and Iran rest heavily upon peace in Afghanistan. The UN peace plan for Afghanistan is moving forward, but slowly. Should it fail, Afghanistan could descend into a Lebanon-like turmoil of drug barons, warlords and foreign mercenaries. That would dash Pakistan's Central Asian ambitions for years to come."

Paul Keating, who replaced Bob Hawke as prime minister in December, is well regarded by only 28% of voters, according to a recent poll. The government is 13 percentage points behind the opposition.
Mr Keating, the country's treasurer (finance minister) during most of Mr Hawke's eight years of office, was the architect of the deregulation of the economy. He was an impressive minister. But most Australians blame him for the present severity of Australia's recession rather than giving him credit for the government's achievements. He once said he could ""throw the switch to vaudeville"" if ever he wanted to win popular appeal, but such bits of song and dance as he has tried since his elevation have fallen flat. At a dinner for George Bush, soon after Mr Keating took over, he tripped over his jokes.
Australians do not anyway want a comedian. They want someone to make Australia feel rich again. His first test as a do-something prime minister will come on February 26th when he will present an economic statement to Parliament. He hopes to stimulate the economy enough to improve his chances in the general election that must be held by mid-1993, but without upsetting the currency market.
The signs are that he will aim for tax incentives for business investments, more industry reforms and perhaps personal tax cuts, but costing no more than A$2 billion ($1.5 billion). For all that they once lauded him, the markets are now more generous than they have been since Labor's early days, fearing Mr Keating will try to spend his way out of trouble.
He will certainly be tempted. Australia's two-year recession is the worst since the second world war, with real GDP tumbling by an estimated 1.4% in 1991. By contrast, output fell only 0.2% in the 1982 recession. The unemployment rate rose to a post-war high of 10.6% in December. Its drop in January, to 10.3%, may signal that e recession has bottomed, but businessmen are gloomy.
The recession has helped to squeeze inflation, to just 1.5%6 in the fourth quarter of 1991, and so has allowed the government to cut short-term interest rates to 7.5%, down from 18.4% in October 1989. But Mr Keating has little room for a big budget stimulus. The federal budget deficit is expected to reach A$6 billion (1.5% of GDP) in the year to June 1992. This may seem modest compared with many other economies, but it would be the first deficit, in five years. Moreover, Mr Keating is constrained by Australia's current-account deficit which continues to loom large (3.7% of GDP last year) despite the deep recession.
What of Mr Hawke, winner of four elections in a row? Mr Keating used to be his closest political friend. But, in his first television interview after becoming prime minister, Mr Keating said that Mr Hawke's consensual leadership style was the ""antithesis of leadership"". Mr Hawke was not pleased. He will get his chance for retribution. On February 20th he resigned from Parliament to become a television talk-show host. Mr Hawke had held his suburban Melbourne seat with a 7% majority. Labor in its present state will be hard put to retain it.
John Hewson, the opposition leader, could never be described as a crowd-puller, but he is performing with confidence. For the first time in a decade, the opposition's stars are in the ascendant. Mr Keating will have to strut his stuff better to win the voters and so justify his party's choice of leader."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224160396/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/20?accountid=14657,"Families in southern Lebanon are once more fleeing north; families in northern Israel once more cower in shelters. Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the leader of the Hezbollah (Party of God), was a dedicated enemy of Israel's. But now, after his killing, the two sides are engaged in an escalating trade of raiding, artillery and rocket fire.
The Israelis have been after Musawi for a long time. On February 16th two missile-firing Israeli helicopters swooped on him as he drove back to Beirut from a rally at Jibchit, the southern hometown of Sheikh Abdelkarim Obeid, the Hezbollah cleric whom the Israelis kidnapped in 1989. Musawi, his wife and his six-year-old son were burnt to death; five of his bodyguards were also killed. Shortly after he was buried in Nabichit, the village in the eastern Bekaa valley where he was born 38 years ago, Hezbollah's 11-man consultative council elected his successor, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah. The armed struggle with Israel, vowed Sheikh Nasrallah, would continue until the Jewish state had been ""wiped out"".
Such dire boasts have always been part of Hezbollah's exaggerated language; its actions have been aimed more modestly at getting Israel and its pro Lebanese militia out of the chunk of southern Lebanon that they control. Hezbollah does not accept the legitimacy of the state of Israel and allows no room for Israeli-Muslim coexistence. But changing this, it says, should be a lifelong struggle for all Muslims, not a cause that it can itself take on single-handedly. Far from following the Palestinian model of cross-border raids, Hezbollah militiamen concentrated their activities, keeping their shells, rockets and individuals on the Lebanese side of the border. That, at least, was the pattern until Musawi's killing.
Hezbollah was formed in the early 1980s by a group of Lebanese Shia inspired by the revolution in Iran. Shia Muslims are Lebanon's largest group, and also the country's poorest and most neglected people. In the 1970s, when they were struggling with Lebanon's establishment for a little justice, the Shia area in southern Lebanon came under the control of Palestinian guerrilla organisations.
Israel's invasion in 1982 brought relief from the Palestinian occupation, and many Shia Lebanese believed Israel's leaders when they said that their troops would soon withdraw. Ten years later, however, Israel still controls Lebanon's deep south. One small Shia group, including Musawi, argued from the beginning that the Israelis would never leave unless forced out; this group became the core of Hezbollah.
The group formed a militia and, partly under Musawi's direction took on the job of harassing Israel's own and proxy soldiers. Its operations have been precise and bloody, making Musawi a marked target for Israeli vengeance. Moreover, by brutal action against the Americans and French in 1983, Hezbollah guerrillas drove the multinational force out of Lebanon.
Iran's revolutionary guards were active at the founding of Hezbollah and the Iranian regime continues to direct many of its activities. Shia Muslims tend to look to Iran as the heartland of their faith and Musawi had been loyal to Ayatollah Khomeini since he studied at Najaf, a holy Shia city in Iraq. But he was a personal friend of Iran's President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani and became influenced by the president's more pragmatic way of thought.
Musawi took over Hezbollah after Khomeini's death in 1989, at a time when the group was involved in a struggle with the pro-Syrian Shia group, Amal, for the hearts and minds of Lebanon's Shias. He set about leading the organisation in a new direction, urging it to take a more constructive role in Lebanon's politics and even to think about participating in parliamentary elections.
He also tried to defuse tension between the Hezbollah militia and the Lebanese army when the regular soldiers began to move south. Other militias were made to disarm but Hezbollah, with Syrian approval, continued its lethal strikes at Israeli positions in the south. Musawi argued that the guerrillas would become part of the national army once Israel's occupation was brought to an end.
Hezbollah's attempts to distance itself from hostage-taking were implausible. The organisation was clearly responsible, though under a medley of cover names, for seizing and holding western hostages in Lebanon. But, in the past year or so, the policy was recognised by both Mr Rafsanjani and Musawi to be self-defeating. Under Musawi's stewardship, most of the western hostages were let go.
Musawi took part in negotiations for the release of Israeli prisoners-of-war and for the return of the remains of dead soldiers. Three bodies were returned, but the Israelis say that Musawi's policy was to play for time and to give little; while the westerners were being released, he is said to have threatened to abduct more Israelis (some 250 Shia Lebanese are still held captive in the Israeli zone, as well Sheikh Obeid in Israel itself). The Israelis discount reports from Lebanon that Ron Arad, the air-force navigator captured in 1986 and believed to be the one Israeli prisoner still alive, has already been killed in revenge for Musawi; they think Mr Arad is still in Iranian hands.
After initial confusion, the Israelis said that Musawi's killing was unrelated to the killing a couple of days earlier of three Israeli soldiers by Palestinians armed with knives and axes. Israel's immediate revenge for this was to bomb Palestinian refugee camps in south Lebanon, killing four people including a woman and two children.
Even if it were coincidental, the Musawi killing may have raised Israeli morale, reassuring people who had begun to doubt their army's skill and prowess. The question is, what next? Israeli tanks have made raids in Hezbollah villages. Two UN soldiers were shot during exchanges with Israelis. But the army, at least, after its bitter experiences when it invaded the country ten years ago, has no desire to move back into Lebanon in force."

Number 221 wears her number pinned on white cardboard to her shoulder. She has arrived, clutching her work papers, at Kuwait's newly refurbished international airport to join the 500,000 immigrant workers who have come to the country since the Iraqis were expelled a year ago.
The Kuwaiti government spoke, after the invasion, of replacing the country's immigrant workforce with homegrown Kuwaitis. But a year has passed and there is little sign that the Kuwaitis are any more prepared to do their own work than they used to be. Before the invasion Kuwaitis made up only 700,000 of the 2.3m population. Palestinians, Jordanians and Egyptians, all unentitled to citizenship, worked in the civil service, the banks and middle management. An army of Indians, Sri Lankans and Filipinos cleaned up after everybody else.
Nine out of ten Palestinians have now been driven from the country, all of them punished for Yasser Arafat's support for Saddam Hussein and for the collaboration charges against a few of their number. The embarrassing military tribunals that followed liberation have been dropped. Trials of collaborators scheduled for last September never materialised. Instead the Palestinians are being quietly sacked and deported (they cannot stay without a work permit). At a desolate border post the deportees arrive on Tuesday and Saturday afternoons under army escort. They drop their plastic Kuwaiti identity cards into a cardboard box as they cross; one card showed the lined face of a Palestinian born on January 10th 1890.
The immigrant workers now coming into the country are offered a different deal. it is specifically designed to encourage them to go home when their contracts, normally two years for unskilled labourers, are up. Educated Egyptians can expect no more than a seven-year contract. The Kuwaitis want no more full-timers who, they complain, were taking over the country.
At the lower end of the scale, Asian workers are forbidden to bring their families with them unless they are earning 650 Kuwaiti dinars ($2,200) a month. The average monthly wage of an Asian immigrant worker is about 40 dinars. Two years spent in an all-male work camp will probably be enough for most. Indian workers cleaning Kuwait city live in a desert camp, sleeping ten or 12 in a room the size of an average bedroom, sometimes three to a bed.
Despite talk of independence, there is little incentive for the Kuwaitis to do their own work. They can afford to go back to business as usual. True the bills are hefty: $22 billion to go to the allies in the Gulf war and an even larger sum to go to their own people to compensate for their suffering in the war. But this has not curbed spending in a country that still has at least 150 more years of oil in reserve. To tide it over, Kuwait has borrowed $5.5 billion from American, European and Japanese banks.
The harsh experience of war has not softened the way some Kuwaitis treat their foreign workers. In the Philippine embassy compound last week a 37-year-old woman lay bruised and beaten on the floor of a house that has been given over to run-away maids. More than 130 were in residence, reporting non-payment of wages, physical abuse and rape by their employers.
The government would like Kuwaitis to take over the better jobs but doubts whether the skills are yet available. Getting on in Kuwait has always depended more on clan connections than on ability or hard work. Many are finding that they miss their sharp competitive-minded Palestinian aides. Twenty years of nepotism has made for flabby work and inefficiency, scolds one bank director.
The psychological impact of the war has generated unprecedented difficulties at work. The usual pattern of worker-boss relations has been complicated by the ""those who stayed and those who went"" polarisation. A 45-year-old company employee who stayed, fought in the resistance, was tortured, and then killed Iraqi soldiers himself finds it hard to accept that he should be expected to ""take orders from some guy who ran away to London."" Instead he takes a monthly salary of $5,000 and just does not go to work.
Post-war worries about nationalism are troubling all levels of Kuwaiti society. The English-language newspaper, the Arab Times, published a debate this month on Kuwaiti men who married foreign women. Some Kuwaiti women argued on the letters page that marriage to foreign women was a plot by outside powers to undermine the social fabric of Kuwaiti society. The Ministry of Education has warned Kuwaiti students who are studying abroad that taking a foreign bride means forfeiting their substantial scholarships.
The Kuwaitis are about to shrink the number of Palestinians and Jordanians still in the country by a new re-registration policy. From now on resident foreigners will be required to apply again for residence visas; to start this cumbersome process they need five character references from Kuwaitis who stayed in the country throughout the occupation. Each case will then be individually considered. A 35-year-old Palestinian born in Kuwait and educated at the London School of Economics says he does not count on staying on."

But the conciliatory words in New York meant something else in Somalia. One of the chieftains, General Mohamed Farah Aydeed, exploited the distraction of the ceasefire talks to try to overrun his rival's positions in north Mogadishu. Somalia's ""interim president"", Ali Mahdi Mohamed, repelled the attack.
Civilians, once again, were the victims. More than 25,000 people have been killed or wounded in three months of fighting. No less than 250,000 Mogadishans--one in eight--have been forced from their homes. The city's port area is a scene of horror. Its Italianate buildings have been wrecked by artillery fire. Decomposing bodies lie unclaimed in the streets. Gangs of children scavenge through the ruins for anything of value overlooked in the looting which has continued since the overthrow of President Siad Barre in January 1991.
The war is between those who ousted Mr Barre's brutal 21-year regime and the city-based businessmen and politicians who won the spoils. General Aydeed is the leader of the United Somali Congress, one of several clan-based groups that opposed the Barre dictatorship. His men battled their way into Mogadishu a year ago, but the presidency was wangled for Mr Mahdi at a conference in Djibouti last July.
Mr Mahdi's brief is to prepare for elections in two years' time. He says, correctly, that General Aydeed has blocked his efforts. General Aydeed, who claims not to want the presidency for himself, accuses Mr Mahdi of filling his administration with ""four pockets"" (corrupt businessmen) and ""two shirts"" (former Barre loyalists). ""They are both mad dogs,"" said one long-suffering resident, ""We can't forgive either of them for destroying this city.""
The fight for power has become a clan feud. Mr Mahdi and General Aydeed belong to the same Hawiye tribe, but to rival sub-clans. General Aydeed belongs to the Habra Gadir, tough nomads from central Somalia who spearheaded the fight against Mr Barre; Mr Mahdi to the Abgal, farmers from the Mogadishu area who largely stayed out of the earlier fighting.
The city is split into armed camps. Boy warriors, stoned on mirah, the local narcotic, roam Mogadishu heavily armed. Their weapon of choice is a 106mm recoilless rifle mounted on the back of a jeep. Other favourites are rocket launchers and anti-aircraft guns. One group has the cannon and rocket pod from a jet fighter bolted to the floor of a truck. Somali children know as much about weapons as western children know about computer games. General Ibrahim Mohamed, who heads a peace committee of neutral clans, says the young fighters ""have no human feeling...there is complete anarchy, they are out of control.""
Unarmed civilians are at the mercy of marauding gangs, caught in the indiscriminate shelling and random gunfire. On a bad day, the three official hospitals in Mogadishu (which lie in General Aydeed's fief) take upwards of 250 casualties. In Mr Mahdi's area, similar numbers are treated in houses converted into emergency operating theatres, wards and dispensaries. Doctors work unpaid, on 24-hour shifts, patching up shattered bodies.
Hunger is universal. The war and the 1990 drought forced farmers to kill or sell their livestock and eat the seed grain needed for this year's sowing. The anarchy of the city makes it almost impossible for relief workers to hand out food; the most they can do is to distribute a little medicine, and fuel for the water pumps. Food in Mogadishu is priced beyond the reach of most families; they have had no wages coming in for over a year. Many make do with one meal every two days. Over half the children are malnourished. Outside the capital, some things are even worse; famine is already striking nomads in central Somalia. The Red Cross is preparing to deliver food to five towns along the coast. But while the mad dogs fight on, there little hope of relief."

His National Party, which had held the seat with a big majority in the 1989 general election, was decisively defeated on February 19th; the Conservative candidate, Andries Beyers, won by more than 2,000 votes out of the 17,000 all-white votes cast.
The swing was more than 11%--which gives Andries Treurnicht's right-wing Conservative Party a fair hope of winning either a referendum or a general election. It is enough to make the CP the largest party if an election were to be held under the present constitution. And Mr de Klerk may not win the white referendum that he has now confirmed will be held on whatever settlement proposals emerge from the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), at which all South Africa's groups are discussing the future.
The CP's victory at Potchefstroom is a high point in the rebellion that started more than ten years ago when the party was formed in reaction to the ""power-sharing"" programme of Mr de Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha. The CP grew steadily during Mr Botha's presidency. It is now surging ahead, winning converts as white South Africans grow ever more uneasy about their president's plans for their future.
For the National Party, the defeat is all the more mortifying for having taken place in Potchefstroom. A farming town in the arid Western Transvaal, Potchefstroom is the intellectual headquarters of the smallest of the three Dutch Reformed Churches and the one to which President de Klerk himself belongs. The Gereformeerde church, which is linked to the University of Potchefstroom for Higher Christian Education (where both Mr de Klerk and his wife, Marike, studied), is theologically conservative but, at least until now, has been radical in its criticism of apartheid.
The Dopper connection (members of the Gereformeerde church are known colloquially as Doppers) and the fact that university students accounted for nearly a quarter of the voters in the by-election makes Potchefstroom an unusual rural constituency, weighted in favour of Mr de Klerk. It was considered to be a National Party stronghold. When the Conservatives were gloating after their triumph at the Virginia by-election in November, the president was rash enough to say that Virginia was unrepresentative but that Potchefstroom would be the real test. Mr Treurnicht has turned Mr de Klerk's words back on him: ""Potchefstroom has spoken, Mr de Klerk...You no longer represent the white electorate.""
Both the NP and the African National Congress are doing what they can to play down the Potchefstroom result. The Nationalists try to attribute it to uncertainty about the negotiating process at Codesa, and argue that once the proposals become clearer, they will regain their lost support. That depends on what the proposals are. If whites believe that they give too much away to the ANC, their resistance could be fortified.
The ANC argues that Potchefstroom is insignificant in the broader context of a non-racial South Africa. Maybe. But Mr de Klerk has committed himself to getting white approval either through an election or a referendum. Zacharia Malekane, the ANC leader in Potchefstroom's black township of Ikageng, has pinpointed the reason for the president's humiliation: ""When Mr de Klerk crossed the bridge, he didn't cross it with the white community."" Mr de Klerk needs to convince a great many more whites that they have to cross the bridge, whether they like it or not."

The most recent dip, on February 13th, followed a report by a Brazilian news agency that Mr Collor had been packed off to hospital--even though at the time the president was swearing in the new health minister at a televised ceremony.
By the conventions of Brazil's presidency Mr Collor is not entitled to a holiday. He has lost weight steadily during his two busy years in office. He insists that his health is sound and, at 42, he maintains a rigorous exercise schedule. But his behaviour is often so quirky that it has left Brazilians uncertain about him.
At the start of the year Mr Collor changed his signature, dropping the ""de"" in his last name, reportedly on the advice of a numerologist. He bean to skip his Sunday jog at which he liked to wear a T-Shirt emblazoned with some political message. He cancelled his regular Tuesday ceremony of walking down the front ramp of the presidential palace with a crowd of beaming supporters. On Wednesday February 5th he stayed home from work.
None of these moves would have been in the least unsettling if Mr Collor had bothered to explain them in advance. Instead he left the Brazilian press to speculate.
In another evolutionary twist, Mr Collor now styles himself a philosopher statesman. He has written a series of broad-based articles in the national newspapers elaborating a social-liberal proposal for reform, a kind of tropical New Deal. It is a far cry from the man who won the election by impressing television audiences as a young and irreverent populist.
All this has highlighted his character as a loner, the chief executive whom almost nobody in the Brazilian capital knows or can communicate with well. Ironically, the president stole the stage from several long-awaited measures he had taken precisely to break his government's isolation. He had fired three ministers hobbled by charges of corruption or inefficiency and replaced them with veteran politicos expected to negotiate better with the Congress.
In addition, he has just had a bit of economic good news. On January 29th the International Monetary Fund approved a $2.1 billion standby loan. Since the agreement is based on the tenth letter of intent Brazil has presented to the IMF since 1983, what mattered was not the documents but the evidence of good relations. In Brazil, which had sparred with the IMF on and off three decades, the accord was widely welcomed as a sign of new financial maturity.
The steady orthodox methods of the finance minister, Marcilio Marques Moreira, have made businessmen feel comfortable. But Mr Moreira's success is by no means assured; the 26% inflation figure in January was the highest it has yet been in Mr Collor's presidency.
A tradition of idiosyncratic presidents is longstanding in Brazil, the product of a huge country with weak institutions and not much history of national consensus building. In some ways Mr Collor reminds Brazilians of one of their odder ex-presidents, the eccentric and mercurial Janio Quadros, who in 1961 resigned with no warning after barely six months in office. He died this month at the age of 75."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224170050/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/25?accountid=14657,"Communism, it used to be said, was a fine creed in theory, but too pure for human beings. Poland's politicians seem determined to prove this true of capitalism. In 1990 the Poles were the boldest reformers in Eastern Europe. Their finance minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, embraced the market with the zeal of Robespierre. Poland, unfortunately, did not embrace Mr Balcerowicz with the same enthusiasm.
The government to which he belonged fell after an election last November which returned to parliament 29 parties, none with more than 13% of the vote. A new government did eventually emerge from this muddle, led by Jan Olszewski, an intelligent and well-meaning man, though not the sort of politician to impose his will. Some colleagues told him to go on with reform, others that the pain was too great and popular resistance too strong.
Rather than explaining to a dazed electorate that, despite high unemployment and falling output, economic reform was beginning to show results, Mr Olszewski chose a plan drawn up by Jerzy Eysymontt, one of Mr Balcerowicz's main critics. At its core is a proposal to shore up jobs in lame-duck state industries, while dampening wage claims with an incomes policy. This sounded like voodoo economics to the finance minister, Karol Lutkowski, who resigned on February 17th. What Poland most needs, he believes, is new anti-inflation and privatisation plans.
Fragmented though it is, the parliament contains a theoretical majority for market reforms. But party friction and personal rivalries make it improbable that its different bits could agree long enough to support a government. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who headed Poland's first reform government (and who picked Mr Balcerowicz), has attacked Mr Olszewski for caving in to populist pressure. Mr Mazowiecki would like his party, the Democratic Union, to join a reform coalition with the liberals and the Centre Alliance, which, confusingly, supports Mr Olszewski.
A strong president might make a difference. But Lech Walesa has distinguished himself by his silence. As president, he has limited powers, the parliament having rebuffed his efforts to win the executive branch more room to govern. His moral authority is not what it was. He feels at sea with economics and is not sure what is right. Isolated in the Belvedere Palace, he gets advice, it is said, from his chauffeur.
The Solidarity union, which Mr Walesa once led against the communist government, is transforming itself into a powerful, national labour advocate. All this puts enormous pressure on Mr Olszewski, whose government can count on barely more than a fifth of the votes in parliament.
Whoever governs must face the dismal arithmetic of Poland's budget. Earlier this year the parliament approved a first-quarter budget with a deficit of 18 trillion zlotys (about $1.5 billion). That cannot be sustained over the year. When last summer the government overshot the target for the budget deficit negotiated with the IMF, the Fund said it would withhold the quarterly tranche of its lending until new targets were agreed and stuck to. Fulfilment of the April 1991-March 1994 stabilisation programme negotiated with the Fund is necessary for the completion of last year's agreement with creditor governments of the Paris Club to write off 50% of the $35 billion Poland owes them.
The government is having trouble from unexpected quarters. Poland's Constitutional Tribunal overruled a government attempt last year to roll back increases in pensions. If that decision is not overturned by a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the deficit will plunge even deeper.
Despite all this there is some good news. Poland's private sector has grown from about 29,000 companies to 50,000 in the past year. In the 18 months up to July 1991 it created 1m new jobs. Poland's drab cities suddenly look like black and white movies in the process of being colourised. Glittery new restaurants and shops--including an Italian boutique in Warsaw that proudly calls itself ""Snobissimo""--appeal to a new middle class.
But private entrepreneurs in Poland tend not to pay taxes, and tax collectors are not up to catching them. The government introduced a personal income tax beginning this year. But collecting it from the private sector is likely to be tricky. The government is modelling its collection system on Italy's Guardia Fiscale.
The main source of revenue for the Polish state budget is, or was, state-owned industry. Many of its companies now simply do not pay up. Though most of them have not yet adapted their products to the western market, they have already worked out how to cheat the Polish tax man. The managements of these companies, which can be dismissed by the elected workers' councils, now routinely pour all of their cash flow into employee salaries. This has produced a Polish conundrum: factories where productivity is falling drastically and wages are rising. Real wages rose 3% last year, the government reports, and pensions shot up 15%.
It was these outmoded factories that were the incubators of the Solidarity movement. Now the same workers, many of whom endured hunger strikes and imprisonment, are being asked to shoulder the load of lay-offs and painful restructuring. No wonder they are losing heart."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224160447/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/26?accountid=14657,"Regional elections in France have seldom seemed so gripping. On March 22nd voters will select new local councils for France's 22 regions. This will be the first real test of the nation's political mood since elections to the European Parliament three years ago. The result could bring to the boil a simmering political crisis. President Mitterrand may have to call for a new prime minister, call an early general election, or even (some hope) call it a day.
The opinion polls all agree that the ruling Socialist Party will take a drubbing next month, and that both the extremist right-wing National Front and the ecologists will see a surge in support. A by-election in Nice on February 16th for a seat on the departmental council provided a harbinger. The National Front candidate took a commanding lead in the first round with 38% of the vote, while the Socialist scraped only 12%, ten points down on the same cantonal election seven years earlier.
There is no suggestion that this pattern would be repeated on a national scale. The by-election took place in an area which had been a National Front stronghold for some time; the party won 30% of the vote in the previous cantonal election there in 1985. In fact the National Front polled fewer votes than last time. Nearly two-thirds of voters did not bother to go to the polls. The result nevertheless sent a shock through all three ""traditional"" parties--the neo-Gaullist Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR), the centre-right Union pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF), and the Socialists.
So certain are the Socialists of their defeat next month that a number of party heavyweights have refused to enter the fray. Laurent Fabius, the new party leader, has had the greatest difficulty dragooning his troops into service. Some government ministers (like Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, and Jack Lang, who is culture minister and government spokesman) have refused point blank to participate. This is scarcely encouraging for the already disillusioned rank and file. The Socialists' position is made more difficult by having some non-Socialist government ministers, such as the environment minister, Brice Lalonde, campaigning against them. Mr Lalonde will lead his own Generation Ecologie list in the elections.
At the previous regional elections in 1986, the ecologists barely existed as a political force in France, winning little more than 2% of the national vote. Now they are being credited with 15-17% support--as much as the National Front. However, their strength is divided between two rival movements, the Generation Ecologie and the longer-established Verts. They have no charismatic leader akin to the National Front's Jean-Marie Le Pen. Even so, they are potential allies for both the Socialists and the moderate right, and are being heavily wooed (unsuccessfully) by both.
The two moderate right parties, the RPR and the UDF, are going into the elections under a single banner. They hold power in 20 of the 22 regions. However, in seven they depend on the support of the National Front; and, in four of these, semi-secret formal alliances have been set up. After March the National Front could hold the balance of power in at least 16 regions. The leaders of both the RPR and the UDF have ruled out future pacts with the extreme right, whether at national or local level. That may not stick if an alliance with the National Front is the only way of shutting out the left.
At local level the Socialists have little to lose in the forthcoming elections. They control only two regions (the Limousin and the Nord-Pas de Calais). Under new voting rules for regional elections, which replace the traditional two-round first-past-the-post system with proportional representation, they could conceivably win one or two more regions. They are more likely to lose one or even both of those they now have. This would be humiliating, but not a disaster. What the Socialists really fear is seeing their vote drop below that of the National Front. This could happen on a low turn-out, because the National Front has its support better mobilised.
This would be a great embarrassment for the socialists, who already lack an overall majority in the National Assembly. To win back public confidence, Mr Mitterrand would probably change the government. The opposition would demand an early general election (the next one is not due until 1993). Mr Mitterrand would seek to avoid that at all costs, fearing that it would result in a landslide for the right.
Just possibly, Mr Mitterrand could make a dignified exit by holding a referendum to reduce the present seven-year presidential term to five years. Applying its provisions to himself, he could bow out gracefully, allowing a more popular Socialist leader, such as Jacques Delors or Michel Rocard, a chance to revive the dispirited troops. But Mr Mitterrand still has three more years to go in an office he waited decades for. He may simply choose to revel in it to the end."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224167112/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/27?accountid=14657,"Of all the problems that the former Soviet Union bequeathed to the Commonwealth of Independent States, the most intractable is what to do about the army. Dividing it up will prove difficult, so difficult that it may yet tear the Commonwealth apart. But so long as it is not divided up, and remains subordinate to the loosely organised Commonwealth, it is not under tight political control, raisin fears that it might emerge as a 12th member of the Commonwealth, threatening all the others.
At their summit meeting in Minsk on February 14th, eight ex-Soviet republics decided that it would be harder to split up the armed forces than to keep them under some sort of unified political control. Six agreed to maintain a single command over conventional forces on their territories for the next couple of years. Two others, Belorussia and Uzbekistan, went along, but with reservations. For them, the Commonwealth remains a useful vehicle for managing the dissolution of the Soviet state.
But three republics--Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldavia--confirmed that they will set up their own armies (apart from strategic forces, which remain under unified command). Thus the Soviet army will be dismembered. Even the prime advocate of a united army, the commander-in-chief, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, left the summit admitting that in two years' time the army would split into national units.
The summit bought some time to sort out some formidable problems. For example, by not establishing its own army immediately, Russia has avoided agitating its neighbours. The Central Asian states, which provided 50% of the army's new recruits in 1991, have more time to find housing and employment for returning soldiers. Moreover, the Central Asian states can ill afford to provide for their own defence. For the time being Russia will defend them, which is better, probably, than Iran or Turkey offering to do so.
Nevertheless, dismemberment will be on the agenda of the next summit; in Kiev on March 20th. The Commonwealth has to decide which military assets should go to Ukraine, Moldavia and Azerbaijan. All of the new states have declared that, except for strategic weapons, all the military stuff that happens to be on their soil is under their control. The three states which want their own armies will want to keep those parts of the old Soviet army that they now have. But Russia objects; It argues that the army's present dispositions reflect the way the former Soviet Union was defended. In order to repel an attack, men and equipment were deployed more heavily in the border republics, especially Ukraine and Belorussia, than in Russia proper.
Then there is the problem of how large future national armies should eventually be, regardless of their current size. If Ukraine took over all the main battle tanks on its territory, it would end up with more than 7,000, which is certainly more than it needs (the French army has 1,350). The Commonwealth states say that this does not matter, because in the long run they will jointly accomplish the reductions promised by the Soviet Union under the treaty governing Coventional Forces in Europe (CFE). But what defence cuts need to be made to reach those targets?
If the formula used in the CFE negotiations were used to divide up the Soviet army, Ukraine would end up with 4,000 tanks west of the Urals, Belorussia would get 2,400 and European Russia 6,000. General Konstantin Kobets, Russia's defence chief, prefers to apply a formula once used by Warsaw Pact countries to establish the size of their armies. This formula, based on territory, population and the length of boarders, yields quite different results. Russia would get 7,100 tanks west of the Urals, Ukraine would get only 2,900 and Belorussia 900.
It seems likely, judging from Ukraine's demand for a large share of the Black Sea fleet, that Ukraine and Belorussia will want to keep as much equipment as possible and will want to stick with the CFE formula. NATO states would also prefer to avoid renegotiating the hugely complex treaty.
Meanwhile, perplexed units of the armed forces are beginning to take matters into their own hands. While the Minsk summit was in progress, pilots unwilling to swear an oath of allegiance to Ukraine flew six aircraft to a base in Russia. In retaliation, Ukraine took over a long-range bomber division after the commander swore an oath of loyalty to Ukraine (the bombers can carry nuclear weapons and therefore ought to be under Commonwealth command). Breaking up is hard to do."

Now the nightmare feared by those who opposed the provision has come to pass. A 14-year-old girl, pregnant as a result of an alleged rape, has been prevented by the High Court in Dublin from travelling to London to have an abortion. The girl, who is said to have been sexually abused for the past two years by a friend of her middle-class family, and is now 11 weeks pregnant, is not only prevented by the courts from seeking an abortion abroad, but even from travelling abroad for nine months. The court insists that she must go through with the pregnancy. If she defies the court, she could be fined or imprisoned.
The case came to the attention of the legal authorities in Dublin when her parents asked the Gardai, the Irish police, if DNA samples from the aborted fetus would be needed in the case they were preparing against the alleged rapist. The address of the London clinic was given, so that the Gardai could collect the tissue samples. When police officers sought instruction from the attorney-general's office they were told not only that DNA tissue would not be admissible in evidence (it would be the product of an illegal act), but also that the attorney-general would be seeking an injunction preventing the child from having the abortion.
Although legal proceedings to prevent the abortion were conducted in closed court, details were leaked in the Irish Times. Meanwhile, the girl, who returned from London on the advice of lawyers, has threatened to commit suicide.
The case has provoked uproar in Ireland and public protests outside parliament. Opposition leaders called for the resignation of the attorney-general, though he was merely upholding the law as it stands. Most people had assumed that the law would be used only to prevent abortions being offered in Ireland, not to take action against individual women. More than 4,000 Irish women come to Britain each year to have abortions. There is now a fear that more of those who do will find themselves denounced and facing legal proceedings. It is also argued that victims of rape may be reluctant to report the crime to the police for fear that, if they became pregnant, they would subsequently be prevented from terminating the pregnancy.
Beset by economic problems, a row over the abortion issue is the last thing Ireland's new prime minister, Albert Reynolds, needs. The 1983 debate on the pro-life amendment to the constitution was the most bitter in recent Irish history. In some Dublin constituencies there was a clear majority opposed to the pro-life clause. Now that the issue is no longer an abstract one of moral argument, but has found expression in a court injunction against a 14-year-old rape victim, opposition to the clause is bound to grow.
The progressive Democrats, junior partners in Mr Reynolds's coalition, want another referendum to strike down the pro-life clause. The pressure for the government to act is immense, and growing. The Irish Times asked in an editorial if the Republic of Ireland was now to be compared to the Iran of the ayatollahs or Ceausescu's Romania. The case, it said, represented a ""descent into cruelty""."

Hence the call by the Scottish National Party for an independent Scotland in Europe. The party, and the increasing numbers of Scots who now say they want independence are willing to exchange subservience to London and a small say in British affairs for a wee but independent voice in the affairs of Europe.
If ""independence"" simply meant home rule, and a Scottish parliament within Britain, with the power to raise taxes, there would be no problem for the Community. Scotland would no doubt expect a more direct say in Brussels on issues affecting its taxation powers, just as the German Lander have. But on most issues, under this model, the Scots would still deal through London, just as the Lander deal through Bonn.
Full independence, in contrast, would cause all sorts of complications. Seen from Edinburgh, the great advantage would be that Scotland would have its own seat in the Council of Ministers, with the right to veto some legislation, and its own European commissioner. Ireland, with only 70% of Scotland's population, and Denmark, which matches its 5m, already have these rights. They also have twice as many Euro-MPs as Westminster-ruled Scotland.
But could Scotland automatically continue to be part of the Community after independence? Scottish nationalists argue that voluntary dissolution of the 1707 Act of Union would create two successor states to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the actual signatory of the Rome Treaty. These would be Scotland and a United Kingdom of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Both should therefore be treated equally. If one stays in, so should the other. If membership has to be renegotiated, both should be required to do so.
Constitutional buffs in Brussels are not so sure. The rump United Kingdom could just as easily tell its EC partners that it was the same country as before, minus a bit of territory. Would Scotland then have to leave the Community and reapply for membership? Probably not. Although the Rome Treaty gives little guidance, it does say that membership is for ever; there is no provision for withdrawal. When Greenland decided to leave the Community in 1984, after winning home rule from Denmark, the French insisted that it could do so only if Denmark's partners agreed (which they promptly did).
Thus an independent Scotland would probably be allowed to stay and make the necessary adjustments from inside. There is another partial precedent here. When East Germany became part of the Community after unification with West Germany in 1990, EC rules were adjusted after the fact. But Germany took care not to seek changes that would require ratification by its partners, such as asking for more Euro-MPs, or an extra commissioner, or changes in the voting system in the Council of Ministers.
The Scots would be asking for all of these. That would give the other EC members a veto. But they would be unlikely to use it. France and Spain might be unhappy at creating a precedent that would appear attractive to Corsicans, Basques, Catalans and their like. But Germany, which has championed self-determination from the Baltic states to Croatia, would hardly stand in the way of a nation that is already part of the Community.
In the end, it would be up to the British. If London and Edinburgh could agree on an amicable parting, their European partners would surely have to accept it."

As the fighting winds dawn and the United Nations struggles to sort out which bits of territory its troops are to protect, both sides in the conflict are getting ready to exploit more than 600,000 registered refugees, to stake out rival claims.
Take Ilok, Croatia's easternmost town. Before the war it had a mere 500 Serb inhabitants. When it surrendered to the Yugoslav army its 3,000 Croats fled. Now their homes are full again, with more than 3,000 Serbs, moved in by the Yugoslav army. An overwhelmingly Croatian town is becoming an overwhelmingly Serbian one. When the Serb-run Yugoslav army leaves, as it must under the terms of the UN peace plan, the new Serb local authority is supposed to stay, but the Croatian refugees are supposed to return to their homes. Yet the newly resident Serbs will not move out if their homes lie outside a UN-protected zone.
The Serb authorities say that housing Serb refugees in Croatian homes is a temporary measure. In fact catch-all regulations, for example requiring former owners to reclaim their property by an unmeetable deadline, aim to help consolidate Serbian-held areas which never had majority Serb populations. UN officials admit that they do not know how to sort out such problems and will have to make up the rules as they go along.
""Our main concern is that the refugees are not pressured into doing things against their will,"" says Judith Kumin, who heads the mission of the UN High Commission for Refugees. But both sides are doing just that. Many homes belonging to Serb refugees in Croatian cities also have new residents. Serbs claim that the Croats have destroyed Serbian houses to prevent their people returning--and so decrease the amount of territory Croatia is likely to lose in any political settlement.
Meanwhile the misery continues. A family of 15, who used to have six houses in their village in central Croatia, is now living in one in Ilok built for five. ""I don't care whose flag flies there,"" said one, ""I just want to go home.""
Whatever the final settlement, tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people will never go back to their homes. Tragically the game being played by Serbs and Croats now has been played in these lands for generations. Sixty years ago much of Ilok's population was German and Jewish. Even today there are 1,900 Slovaks who migrated there in the 18th century. Under the Turks, Ilok was a Muslim settlement. Before that it was Catholic. Nobody is talking about a new Europe here."

The economy slumped, democracy failed, hatreds started two world wars. The second half, by contrast, has been an astonishing success, at least in the western bit of Europe lucky enough to have been liberated (or defeated) by the Americans.
Since 1945 Europeans have had 47 years of peace with each other--a respite unmatched since the emergence of modern states in the 16th century. The average West European's income (at 1990 prices) has risen more than 300%, from $4,860 a year in 1950 to $20,880 in 1990. Life expectancy for West Europeans went up in that time from 67 to 76 years. Between 1960 and 1990 a West European schoolchild's chance of going on to higher education more than tripled.
In these years West Europeans grew more alike--in how many children they had; in where they worked; in how they voted, saved and invested. Their governments were able to take more and more economic decisions in common. Rising incomes and increasing co-operation reinforced each other in a virtuous circle.
The institutional framework for this was the European Community. It has steadily grown in power and numbers. It already accounts for 69% of Europe's population and 81% of its GNP. Between 1958 and 1986 the Community doubled its membership. Success seems magnetic. To judge by the queue of plausible applicants, it could now double again in half that time.
Given pre-war failure, a natural question is whether Western Europe's post-war success was a temporary freak or something durable in which East Europeans can now expect to share. Though favouring the optimistic view, these briefs have also stressed how much the Soviet-American struggle known as the cold war sheltered Western Europe. Its passing raises three questions that West Europeans, in their modern greenhouse, have not really had to think about.
THE EASTERN QUESTION
The first is the unfreezing of their eastern border. If Europe is no longer divided at the Elbe, where to the east does Europe stop? At Poland's eastern frontier? Which of the westernmost states of the ex-Soviet Union--Belorussia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia and Ukraine--are in Europe?
This is more than a geographers' puzzle. Poverty and turmoil, with their threat of unwanted migrants, now loom in western politicians' minds as an eastern threat to be feared almost as much as Soviet missiles once were. A common first reaction was to offer advice and some aid, but otherwise to keep the easterners and their problems at arm's length until westerners could think through the upheavals of the past two years and sort out where they wished to go.
Economic aid and advice, though welcome, are not substitutes for market access and, eventually, membership of the EC. In December 1991 Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland signed association agreements with the EC, which opened western markets only somewhat. In keeping East European exports out, the EC is being short-sighted. Letting in farm goods (in particular) could do two things. Not only would it be one of the best ways to help East European economies. It might also help wreck the EC's wasteful farm policy.
Westerners have a range of discouraging arguments against easterners asking to join the EC. Their heavy punch is that the difference in wealth is simply too large. This is not the knock-out it sounds. Ireland's GDP per head in 1990 (using purchasing-power parities) was 63% of the EC average, Greece's 58% and Portugal's 53%. Comparable figures for Czechoslovakia were 66% and for Hungary 53%.
Opinion in the West is shifting. The ""wideners"", who want to enlarge the Community, seem to be winning. Enlargement appeals to anti-federalists who think that widening the EC means weakening its supra-national drive. Enlargement is gaining a more general appeal among those who see it, despite the costs, as the safest and tidiest way to meet the eastern problem.
A boost to the wideners is that it is almost certain that the EC will open its doors soon to countries from the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Austria and Sweden have applied. Finland intends to soon. Switzerland, chaperoning tiny Liechtenstein, and Norway are likely to apply later this year. (Iceland says it does not want to join.)
Entry talks would be swift. The hard work was done in an EC-EFTA agreement initialled in February 1992. This was to create a common market between the two. EFTA countries would not pay EC taxes or get more than a minor say in EC decisions affecting them--in effect, a B-grade membership. If entry talks started this year or next, up to six EFTA countries could be grade-A members by January 1995.
That date matters. In 1996 the Twelve are to have another go at institutional reform. The EC summit at Maastricht in December 1991 was in a sense the closing of an old agenda. The next set of internal changes must almost certainly make adjustments for an expanded Community.
Not long after that, the EC could be in position to consider poor easterners. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, the three Baltic states and Slovenia look the most likely. If these are politically stable and press on with economic reform, they could be rich enough to join by, say, the year 2000. Hungary hopes, optimistically, to join by 1996. Exact timing matters less than the final goal. Confidence in eventual EC membership helped steady democracy in Spain and Portugal, even though it took them almost ten years to get it.
Enlargement raises an invidious question: who to leave out. Turkey has already been rebuffed once. Cyprus and Malta, who have applied, may also be asked to come back later. It is not only to the east that Europe's borders grow fuzzy. The Mediterranean helps, but where, to the south, does Europe stop?
The countries that are likely to join pose problems of neutrality, institutional clogging and budgetary overload. None looks insurmountable.
The end of the cold war makes neutrality less of an issue than it was. Norway and Iceland belong to NATO and most easterners want to join it. Austria's and Finland's neutrality--nonmembership in either cold-war camp--was imposed on them. Sweden's and Switzerland's neutralism--no military alliances in peace, keeping out of others' wars--is a deliberate and longheld policy. Neutralism could still clash with EC membership as it develops common foreign and defence policies. (This is theoretically a problem for Ireland, which is not in NATO.)
To stop an enlarged Community from clogging up, it is likely that it would have to:
* Cut the ratio of commissioners to countries, currently 17 to 12.
* Lower the number of official languages (nine) to three or four.
* Make debate in the Council of Ministers more parliamentary: at the moment all 12 ministers speak in turn, however little they have to say.
* Keep the parliament's size (now 518 members) below 700-750.
* Reallocate the votes in the council and, for some issues, lower the majority required.
Adding poorer countries means more revenue-sharing or regional spending. That risks budgetary overload. To some extent rich countries would merely be passing through the EC budget money otherwise spent as aid to the newcomers. The balance of poor and rich countries in the council would, all the same, shift dramatically: from four out of 12 now to 11 out of 25.
Some say that a Community that worked at six and again at 12 will work at 18 or 25. Deals can be made in an expanded council, just as they are now. Others say that 18 or so is a maximum beyond which the Community would lose its character as a tight-knit group of nations with common positions on world trade and foreign policy.
Neither view is right. With 18 or 25 members, the EC will not be able to go on as before. But nor will it seize up or collapse back into a collection of individual sovereignties. As it grows, members will sign up for different things at different times. This is known as a ""variable-geometry"" or ""many-speed"" Europe. Though federalists do not always like it, such a Europe is already taking shape.
THE GERMAN QUESTION
German nationalism started or helped start three European wars between 1870 and 1945. Defeat in the last one cost Germany full nationhood. Now it has it back, the rest of Europe wants to know how it will be used. Most Europeans would prefer, as a trio of world powers, America, Japan and the Community to America, Japan and Germany. So probably would most Germans. The question is not ""Germany in the EC or out?"" but how Germany will it use its weight within.
Germany can be awkward if it chooses. It has the same number of seats in the parliament as Britain, France and Italy. But its population is almost half as big again and it wants more seats. Germany is the largest net contributor to the EC budget, to the tune of 9 billion ecus ($11.3 billion) a year. It is busy absorbing eastern Germany and in no mood to be so generous. Its push for European recognition of the breakaway Yugoslav republics, Croatia and Slovenia, showed a readiness to brush aside British and French pretensions to run Europe's foreign policy.
It is, though, historical fatalism to think that modern, democratic Germany must repeat its non-democratic past. Geography, certainly, gives it a special interest and a privileged position in the east. Yet for the foreseeable future Germany will have a much bigger trade and investment stake in Western Europe.
Germany's weight in the EC is known. What is not known (most of all, it seems, by the Germans themselves) is how they are to use it. Will Germany nudge Europe towards a more dirigiste (French) or more free-market (British) capitalism? Will it push for an open trading block or a closed one which shuns investment from non-European multinationals? Will it continue to favour an Atlantic alliance linked to America or a more continental-minded Europe?
Though Germany will often be the deciding vote, on many of these points German opinion is divided. That leaves its smaller partners room to bargain and argue. As sumo wrestlers know, weight is not everything.
THE WESTERN QUESTION
Western policy during the cold war was to contain the Soviet Union. But cold-war containment worked in a less expected way as well, by keeping economic friction between America, Europe and Japan within reasonable limits. Now that they are no longer united as anti-communists, might these three compete ever more aggressively among themselves as regional power blocks? And in that three-cornered fight, might a European patriotism be born?
Extrapolating the past suggests that, without a common enemy, the western powers could slip from being allies to being antagonists. But extrapolationism is dangerous. Shared interests can override economic conflicts. It is too soon to talk of world economic government. But the GATT, the IMF and the G7 all work so as to lessen economic frictions.
The metaphor of ""power blocks"" is itself misleading. Only America currently has the combination of wealth, military strength and political cohesion to make it a world power. Japan lacks the military strength, Europe the political cohesion. In terms of social and economic indicators (see charts), the countries of Europe add up to a large and growing presence in the world. (Charts omitted) As a world power, though, Europe does not yet exist.
The optimum unit of economic government is now larger than the European nation-state. For that reason alone, the European Community is likely to endure and prosper. There are other reasons for confidence in its future. Compared with other options, it still offers Germany and its neighbours the internal balance that Europe needs. Its economic work is far from done. There is almost a decade of change ahead to get Europe a single currency, and perhaps 20 years to complete the single market (1992 was just a beginning).
Despite common interests and shared views, many European states are hesitant about pooling diplomatic and military sovereignty. A benchmark of progress in this direction would be the EC's readiness to take a single seat on the Security Council at the United Nations. That still looks some way off.
The Community of the future will most probably remain a flexible hybrid with federal and inter-governmental features. it is a novel creature in world politics that could in time be imitated in Africa, America and Asia.
A leap from this sort of EC to a United States of Europe looks less probable. The pressures on European governments to pool economic sovereignty are different from those that produced modern nation-states. There is no urge for unification (19th-century Germany and Italy), no drive for separation (Muslim India in 1947; the Soviet republics in 1991), no desire for independence (decolonisation).
Two other things can help forge a sense of nationhood. One is democracy. Citizens, after all, have to be citizens of something. European voters do seem to want more control over the EC: they want their voice represented at the European level. But it is not clear they want a European authority to command their chief loyalty as citizens.
Outside pressure is another nation-former. Some Europeans see their continent as a 19th-century nation writ large, with interests to defend against all sorts of external threat, real or imagined: not just economic encroachment by Japan or America, but immigration from the east or the spread of Islam from the south. Yet these dangers do not look real enough to create Europeans. Where believed in, they seem to be fostering bitter nationalism more than Europeanism.
What is Europe? Who is a European? Herodotus thought that, scattered as they were, Greeks were one people because they spoke Greek and had distinctive common values. By that test, Europeans are not a people. No sane European speaks Esperanto or Volapuk. Europe's political values--democracy and human rights--are not Europe's alone. Even if race, religion or colour did define Europeans, they would be tests used by bigots.
An Italian patriot, Massimo d'Azeglio, said, ""We have made Italy; now we must make Italians."" Treating Europe as whatever Europeans believe it to be seems equally circular. Is Europe, then, a cultural area where musicians use the diatonic scale? or a geographic one bounded by southern olive groves and northem beech forests?
The fact is that Europe does not need to be defined. It is by its nature open-ended. Whatever 21st-century Europe proves to be, it will not be a 19th-century nation-state built on a continental scale."

There is no urge for unification (19th-century Germany and Italy), no drive for separation (Muslim India in 1947; the Soviet republics in 1991), no desire for independence (decolonisation).
Two other things can help forge a sense of nationhood. One is democracy. Citizens, after all, have to be citizens of something. European voters do seem to want more control over the EC: they want their voice represented at the European level. But it is not clear they want a European authority to command their chief loyalty as citizens.
Outside pressure is another nation-former. Some Europeans see their continent as a 19th-century nation writ large, with interests to defend against all sorts of external threat, real or imagined: not just economic encroachment by Japan or America, but immigration from the east or the spread of Islam from the south. Yet these dangers do not look real enough to create Europeans. Where believed in, they seem to be fostering bitter nationalism more than Europeanism.
What is Europe? Who is a European? Herodotus thought that, scattered as they were, Greeks were one people because they spoke Greek and had distinctive common values. By that test, Europeans are not a people. No sane European speaks Esperanto or Volapuk. Europe's political values--democracy and human rights--are not Europe's alone. Even if race, religion or colour did define Europeans, they would be tests used by bigots.
An Italian patriot, Massimo d'Azeglio, said, ""We have made Italy; now we must make Italians."" Treating Europe as whatever Europeans believe it to be seems equally circular. Is Europe, then, a cultural area where musicians use the diatonic scale? or a geographic one bounded by southern olive groves and northem beech forests?
The fact is that Europe does not need to be defined. It is by its nature open-ended. Whatever 21st-century Europe proves to be, it will not be a 19th-century nation-state built on a continental scale."

They have prospered under the Tories, and Labour is convinced it can get a better deal out of them for the consumer. So managers who thought they had seen the last of politicians bent on imposing Whitehall's fiat could find themselves fighting a fresh battle--against politicians using regulation to worm their way into their businesses and determined to assault prices, profits, salaries and much else besides.
Neil Kinnock's new model Labour Party plans to renationalise only the national electricity grid and the water companies--and these only when they could be easily afforded. Partly, the change of heart is due to financial realities. Buying a controlling 51% stake in BT, British Gas, and the electricity and water companies would cost some L14 billion ($24.5 billion) at current market prices. Probably just as important, though, is the enthusiasm with which Labour's advisers are eyeing the regulatory machinery set up by the Tories.
Seeing the success of regulators like Oftel and Ofgas in getting BT and British Gas to cut their costs and prices and to raise the quality of their services, Labour has realised that not only is nationalisation unaffordable, it is unnecessary. Why buy a firm when you can boss it around for free?
Not that Labour thinks highly of the Tories' regulatory system. Shadow ministers plan to shake things up. Today's Of-squad--Oftel, Ofgas, Offelect and Ofwat--would be consolidated into one Consumer Protection Commission, and given more money. This, says Labour, would mean a bigger and beefier regulator, less likely to be ""captured"" by the regulated firms. Maybe. On the other hand, a single regulator might be a lot easier than half-a-dozen small ones for an interfering government to capture.
Labour's main aim is to win lower prices for customers--and that means for householders, not just large business customers. The utilities' profits, says Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, are excessive. Labour would consider insisting on one-off price cuts, and would review present price controls.
Many of Labour's complaints are fair: there is growing evidence that Britain's utilities are earning too high a rate of return. For instance, BT's operating margin--26.5%--is higher than that enjoyed by any of the American regional telephone companies. But Labour is ignoring the virtues of the current regulatory set-up. Regulators review price formulae only every few years, so firms can plan investment well ahead. And since they keep whatever profits they make, they have incentives to be as efficient as possible. If firms believed that any profits achieved through cost-cutting would be regulated away, the incentives would vanish.
Another big Labour theme is quality regulation. New rules might range from setting tougher quality targets--on things like energy conservation for the electricity companies, or the speed of line repair for BT--to a price formula that would lower prices if quality were deemed too poor.
Labour's Big Regulator would also control top salaries. Little more than a populist gesture, this could do much harm. Utility bosses are not highly paid compared with their private-sector peers. The inability of state-owned firms to hire the best managers, because they could only offer civil-service salaries, was always a debilitating weakness of the old nationalised industries in the 1970s.
Labour's regulatory proposals might not be too worrying were it not also for the party's attitude to competition. Unlike the Liberal Democrats, Labour sees regulation as a surrogate for competition--unless competition can be shown to be ""in the public interest"". When pressed, Labour spokesmen struggle to find examples of where this might apply. A Labour government would not even contemplate breaking up British Gas or BT, nor would it proceed with Tory plans to reduce the Post Office's monopoly on carrying letters (even though the Post Office's chairman accepts that diluting the monopoly would be reasonable). All Whitehall's work on privatising the railways would be shelved.
The Opposition's proposals for the electricity-supply industry are particularly flawed. Where most critics of electricity's privatisation attack the absence of competition between the two generating firms, National Power and Powergen, and call for them to be broken up, Labour takes the opposite line. It rejects the idea of having more generators; instead, it plans to return the national grid (currently owned by the 12 regional distribution companies) to public ownership--possibly by giving the government's remaining 40% stake in the generators to the distribution companies in exchange for their shares in the grid. This would, in effect, remove the existing element of competition between generators and distributors, widely welcomed at the time of their sell-off.
Once nationalised, the grid would have a new ""strategic role"". Three aspects of the grid's putative role are worth describing in detail:
* The grid would be given powers to dictate to the generators a need for ""security of supply""--Labour-speak for using coal mined in Britain, rather than cheaper foreign coal. According to Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, imported coal cannot be relied on--Islamic fundamentalists and restless Russians, he says, may cause trouble--whereas British coal (Arthur Scargill notwithstanding) can.
* The grid must ""husband Britain's indigenous fuel reserves""--ie, the country's gas reserves are smaller than its coal reserves, so burn less gas and more coal.
* The grid must help the balance of trade. Britain, points out Mr Dobson, imports more fuel than it exports, which harms the balance of trade. The answer, he suggests, is to import less fuel and use more British fuel, blithely ignoring the fact that British fuel is more costly, and would hence raise electricity prices--increasing manufacturers' costs and, oops, hitting exports.
If Labour is to persuade the electorate that its regulation policies are not nationalisation in disguise, it should reject woolly thinking like Mr Dobson's and explain, in detail, exactly what its reformed stance towards competition would mean in practice."

The city eats up a disproportionate share of NHS resources. Yet Londoners receive some of the worst health care in the country. The King's Fund, an independent think-tank, has been trying to explain this problem (among others) since 1897. On February 19th it published its latest thinking in a series of reports*.
The genesis of the London problem is clear. London built a large number of hospitals in the late 19th century, when it was the capital of a world empire. Then the population of its inner boroughs began to slide. To offset the loss of local customers, London turned itself into a net exporter of health care. Today about a quarter of patients in inner-London hospitals are nonresidents.
Most are attracted by London's offer of the best high-tech medicine. But this has left the capital with two big weaknesses. First, Londoners have lost out as their health authorities have invested in high-tech hospitals at the expense of primary care. This imbalance has been getting worse for 30 years. Health ministers since the early 1970s have been trying to shift resources from inner London to the rest of the country. But the capital's hospitals have been stout defenders of their glamorous specialist services.
The second snag is that London hospitals have for years pursued their export role with a blithe disregard for costs. The result: they are less cost-effective than their counterparts in the rest of the country. London hospitals have lower patient throughputs (to use the jargon of health economists) and higher staffing levels than their rivals elsewhere: staff costs per head of local population are a whopping 80% higher than in the rest of the country.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the former health minister who introduced the current reforms, used to argue that the internal market would solve the problem. Health authorities around the country would concentrate on costs rather than cossetting London's hospitals. The latter would fend for themselves in a national market-place--or go under. But the mere thought of one of them going under in the run-up to an election appalled the government. So William Waldegrave, Mr Clarke's successor, appointed a formal inquiry in October 1991 to sideline the problem.
Support for solution-by-inquiry is one bit of health policy on which the Tories now see eye-to-eye with the Labour Party and independent organisations such as the King's Fund. For Tories this is both inconsistent--how can you combine a market-driven system in the rest of the country with protectionism in the capital?--and naive.
Bureaucratic solutions have singularly failed to balance supply and demand in the capital. The government is right to suspect that the internal market will shake up London health care and infuriate the medical establishment. The alternative is to go on with a service that shortchanges Londoners--and will provide ample material for critical reports by the King's Fund well into the 21st century.

They are making up their minds whether or not to order 48 Tornado fighters and 60 Hawk trainers. With that order, the British aerospace industry (the largest in Europe, and the biggest chunk of Britain's defence industry) will have a couple of years' respite before the next bout of trouble. Without it, the industry's troubles will grow.
The announcement on February 19th of pre-tax losses of L81m ($142m) at British Aerospace (BAe) for 1991 (see page 62) (article, page 62 omitted) was the culmination of a burst of bad news over the past couple of months--only marginally offset by fresh orders for the RAF worth L500m on February 19th. A week earlier, BAe itself announced 2,350 redundancies. Other contractors are shrinking, too. Some 2,000 jobs are to go at Ferranti, 540 at Dowty, several hundred at Vosper Thorneycroft, 600 at VSEL.
The big names hit the headlines, but the ripple effect among hundreds of sub-contractors goes largely unremarked. Overall, probably 400,000 people were employed in defence-equipment manufacturing a couple of years ago; Keith Hodgkinson, a defence-industry analyst at Lehman Brothers International, a City stockbroker, reckons a fifth of those defence-industry jobs have since disappeared.
Jobs are going in regions that initially seemed to be weathering the recession relatively well. The military aerospace industry is based mostly around Bristol in the south-west and Preston in the north-west; ships and submarines are centered on Newcastle, Barrow and Glasgow, armoured vehicles on Leeds and Telford. Some of the worst afflicted localities have an uncomfortable political dimension for the government: the south-west and north-west, in particular, have a concentration of marginal seats--including that of the Tory party chairman (C. Patten, Bath, majority 1,412).
To make things worse for the Tories, the severity of the cuts is tied directly to government policy. Privatisation and truly competitive tendering by Whitehall have left contractors more vulnerable to falling demand than in countries where defence work is state-owned or heavily subsidised. But privatisation has also helped sharpen up the industry. Vickers bought a Royal Ordnance factory from the government, knocked buildings down and cut the workforce by 40%. Vickers's managing director, Sir Colin Chandler, also cites ""the government's taut approach to competition"" as a catalyst of greater efficiency--and better prospects, perhaps, in world markets.
The government's most handsome legacy to the industry, though, remains a longstanding contract with Saudi Arabia for aircraft, maintenance and the construction of military buildings. Over the past five years it has brought in annual payments that have risen from L500m ($875m) to L2 billion last year. BAe is the main contractor; but the deal involves most of the industry. The order for another batch of aircraft could mean a further Ll billion a year, helping to plug the hole left by NATO cutbacks. But financing the deal is proving a problem. Even Saudi Arabia is feeling the pinch after the Gulf war--and cannot sell as much oil as it likes.
So British companies are scouting around for other markets--as are all their competitors. East Asia is currently the favourite target. But even where there are buyers, competition is tough, particularly from the French. While the British benefit from their relative efficiency, dirigisme helps the French: British companies are more likely to compete with each other than are the French giants. And the British argue that their political principles put them at a commercial disadvantage. ""Supergun aside,"" says Sir Colin robustly, ""we are much more rigorous in assessing who we will sell to. The French supplied Iraq all the way through the Iran-Iraq war.""
Increasingly, competition will come not just from other countries, but also from a growing second-hand market. Ex-Soviet T-72 tanks are said to be on the market for $75,000 (against $2m for a new one), MIG29s for half the price of a Tornado.
Some of Britain's products are not holding up well in the face of all this. According to Peter Kenyon, managing director of the privatised Royal Ordnance, a subsidiary of BAe, ""the Ministry of Defence's requirements do not necessarily gel with the demands of export markets."" The Tornado, after its initial success in Saudi Arabia, has failed to sell. The aircraft is fine as a bomber, but is not a fighter; and world demand, increasingly, is for light fighters. The Tornado's production will stop in the middle of this year unless a new deal materialises. Other products, like Hunting's JP233 airstrip-disabling bomb which was used to good effect in the Gulf war, are designed specifically for the Tornado.
In several markets, the West's more sophisticated hardware is increasingly under suspicion as too costly and too hard to use. Places like Jordan and Malaysia are showing a preference for lower-tech equipment, to the detriment of sales in state-of-the-art weaponry. Royal Ordnance, for instance, has not been able to sell its SA80 rifle abroad. It is a sophisticated weapon which is extremely accurate in the right hands; but it has failed to catch on against established alternatives.
All these changes look certain to reduce the number of defence companies in Britain over the next five years. The struggle to survive will push many managers to look harder at international collaboration as a way of reducing costs. The brightest beacon on this front is still the European Fighter Aircraft, a German-Italian-British-Spanish venture; and there were reports this week that BAe and Dassault Aviation of France may be offered joint finance by their two governments, to look into fresh work on the next generation of fighter aircraft.
But more collaboration will bring its own difficulties. Growing links between the French and German defence industries--over projects like Eurocopter, a Franco-German helicopter venture launched last year--have been nurtured by governments that see robust defence companies as a strategic need. Squaring this with Britain's competitive approach is going to require a special industriesoverprojects like Eurocopter, a kind of guidance system."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224137205/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/36?accountid=14657,"It will be, the nation is informed, the most ""presidential"" election in British history. Aeroplanes with silly names like Blue Leader have been hired. Conservative Central Office has copied the 1987 Labour campaign's broadcast about the Kinnocks by commissioning an arty film about the Majors. Spin-doctors and policy-surgeons on both sides concur that the personalities of John Major and Neil Kinnock will be an--even the--issue.
It is all nonsense, and the whistle should be blown before it gets out of hand. Mr Major and Mr Kinnock, both perfectly nice and decent men, are by now followers. They follow the polls. They follow the policy consensus. They even follow newspaper editorials. Leaders, by contrast, have a compelling vision of the country they want to create, and seem to know how to go about it; they have the force of personality and of language to persuade large numbers of people to get off their bottoms and follow them, with at least a little enthusiasm.
By these strict but not unreasonable lights, neither Mr Major nor Mr Kinnock is a leader, in the way that William Gladstone, Nye Bevan, Harold Macmillan or Margaret Thatcher were peacetime British leaders. That is not surprising: leaders are not perpetually available in a bottom drawer for party managers to rummage in. They are a rare commodity. It ought, though, to expose the big lie behind any attempt to sell the 1992 general election as presidential.
Neither Mr Major nor Mr Kinnock would like to be called just followers. Not that any political commentator will ever put it to them directly (""Ahem, you are not really much of a leader, are you?"") But the response would be wholly predictable. After all, both men chair meetings, speak to rallies and have a mutual interest in persuading the rest of us that their personal contest is a battle of titans.
Thus, in the Commons this week, Mr Kinnock was attempting to portray Mr Major as a heartless, Thatcherite stage-villain. He tried to tag him with the unattractive phrase used by his chancellor, Norman Lamont, that rising unemployment and the recession added up to a price ""well worth paying"" for lower inflation. Mr Major said Mr Kinnock should withdraw the charge. Rightly. Mr Major never said it. He refused to repudiate the phrase, but that is not quite the same as uttering it. On the other hand, Mr Major told MPS that ""in context"" Mr Lamont had never said such a thing either--which is nonsense. Reports have it that Mr Kinnock told his backbenchers after the exchanges that the prime minister had proved himself to be ""Mrs Thatcher in drag"".
In his turn, Mr. Major was trying to paint Mr Kinnock as a wild, foaming lefty who wanted to ""cripple British industry by bringing back flying pickets, by encouraging mass pickets"". Major the reincarnation of Thatcher; Kinnock the militant in a donkey-jacket. Crude and silly abuse--or subtle mutual flattery? To everyone else, they looked like slightly flushed men in suits.
They are not the same, however. Their attitudes to leadership have been shaped by their careers and are worth recapping, since the leadership issue will dominate over the next several weeks. Mr Major is a naturally self-effacing executive who emerged, blinking, into the daylight at the top of the skyscraper after years of smooth upward movement on a hidden elevator. This elevator stopped at offices marked obscurely ""junior whip"", ""social security under-secretary"". Only latterly did he get offices with windows through which he could be glimpsed, as chief secretary to the Treasury, and then chancellor. Mrs Thatcher was in charge of the lift and the offices were in her gift but she relied on the murmured advice of other executives. Mr Major got on as an insider, part of a management elite--not as a leader.
Mr Kinnock, on the other hand, got his job on platforms. But not national platforms, party ones. His gifts for witty, ex tempore speechifying to bands of the party faithful were what made him indispensable in the early 1980s to an organisation rapidly losing faith in itself. The Labour Party is, like all parties, a sect; and Mr Kinnock was crowned for giving it that old-fashioned religion. Once the leader, he scrapped the old rituals, doused Hellfire and introduced a trendy new prayer-book.
But he never quite made the transition to TV-evangelist. He reformed the sect, but he stayed (in a non-pejorative sense) a sectarian. It is, contrary to its image, a warm and relatively happy sect. Anyone who has been inside the Labour family knows the mutual support and friendship that the party in the constituencies (as opposed to the hothouse of Westminster) gives insiders. It can be as nourishing as any church or clan. Yet, as with all sects, its internal strengths can appear baffling and even threatening to outsiders. Mr Kinnock is a Labour man in every muscle and synapse. That gives him a hidden strength and it will not be surprising if he outcampaigns Mr Major in the weeks ahead. But it explains a hidden weakness: for many uncommitted voters, he remains somehow alien--not quite ""one of us"".
What does this mean for the election? It suggests that neither Mr Major nor Mr Kinnock will ever wholly satisfy as a national leader. This may not matter: it can be argued that Britain has become a grown-up place in which citizens no longer look to politicians for miraculous cures, but merely expect them to get on competently with the business of adjusting tax rates and servicing creaky legislation. A country where they go to their priests for morals, not to their MPs. A place, in short, where old-style leadership is obsolete.
Alternatively, those who view Britain as a society still in decline, and deeply unsure of its place in the world, might fairly conclude that leadership is still needed--and might rue the lack of it. (The Liberal Democrats' Paddy Ashdown has qualities to consider; but he is not about to become the prime minister.)
There is a second, more immediate, conclusion for election-watchers. They should reject the notion that Mr Major and Mr Kinnock are the two most significant points in the coming campaign. Their leading cabinet and shadow-cabinet members are, collectively, just as important--and the party policies on education, tax and industry will matter far more than either. This time, a ""presidential election"" would be a cheap evasion. Voters should refuse to tolerate it."

American pop stars might dominate the airwaves, but the gadgets they appear on--television sets, compact-disc (CD) players, games machines and video cassette recorders (VCRs)--are mostly made by Japanese firms. But if they can exploit their well-honed skills in software and digital technology, American firms now have a chance to recapture a big slice of the market.
Consider this recent reversal of fortunes. On February 19th Japan's Sony announced a 17% fall in operating profits for the third quarter--and forecast an overall 45% plunge for the year ending March 1992. Also on February 19th Japan's personal-computer industry reported a 17% drop in sales between October and December; revenue for the whole year, it gloomily predicted, would be down for the first time ever. The same day, Apple Computer of California welcomed 120,000 paying visitors to its MacWorld exhibition in Tokyo. Among Japanese computer users, Apple's brand awareness now ranks second only to NEC's. Since 1987 Apple has seen its annual sales in Japan soar from $20m to $400m.
Apple's genius lies in the software that makes its computers easy to use. Back in the early 1980s it pioneered a way of operating a computer by using graphical icons on the screen instead of typed instructions. Apple's Macintosh is the computer for people who don't care about computers. ""We're a right-brain company (ie, graphical) in a left-brain (ie, letter-and-number) industry,"" jokes Apple's chairman, John Sculley. ""Fortunately, the Japanese seem to be more comfortable with graphics than words.""
Not only the Japanese. All computer makers--IBM included--are now aping Apple's graphical ways. And the trend is not restricted to the computer industry. With most people unable even to operate their video recorders properly, Japan's consumer-electronics industry is desperate to emulate Apple, too. All the more so now the next generation of consumer gadgets--so-called ""multimedia"" devices that merge words, photos, video, data and music--will be even more mind-boggling than today's.
Last month Apple said it was entering the consumer-electronics business--and was looking for Japanese partners. Its strategy is built around devices called Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Unlike personal computers, PDAs will perform specific tasks--as electronic diaries, multimedia players, personal communicators and the like. All will be hand-held, and will allow a user to look up information or communicate with others--either via the telephone line or through wireless telephones. Apple expects to introduce its first PDAs in 1993.
The one thing they all have in common is ease of use. This is because PDAs are digital--and therefore programmable like a computer. Clever software can then be used to take the complexity and drudgery out of getting them to work properly.
BYE BYE, MR BELL
CD players and digital-audio-tape (DAT) recorders apart, most consumer-electronics products on the market today are analogue--a technology, dating back to Alexander Graham Bell, which mimics sound or light with changes in voltage ""analogous"" to the waves it is evoking. This is one reason why the profit margins of Japan's consumer-electronics firms have become so thin. The quality of such analogies depends upon the quality of the electronic parts--the latter cannot shrink in price anything like as fast as digital ones when their production volumes are cranked up.
Making matters worse, Japanese consumer-electronics firms have failed to come up with any new hit products to wow the public. Nothing has come along in more than a decade to match the success of the VCR, whose sales are now tailing off. The new, pin-sharp high-definition television (HDTV) Sets will be big business once their price is slashed from today's $25,000. In the meantime Japan's consumer-electronics firms are pinning their hopes on a bunch of multimedia products to bridge the ""digital gap"" (see chart on next page). (Chart omitted)
The consumer-electronics industry is going digital for reasons of cheapness and flexibility as well as higher fidelity. In some applications, digital is the only way to handle the vast amounts of information involved--as in the case of the next generation of HDTV sets. Digital processing also allows the information to be conveyed in pristine condition, banishing squeaks and flashes. From America's point of view, the dash for digital plays to one of its more successful industries. It also plays to one of America's talents--writing innovative software.
Take Apple's latest software wizardry, called QuickTime. This lets a Macintosh synchronise up to 24 different channels of information--be they voice, video, data, fax or whatever--into a single recording or message. Imagine mentioning your new pet dog in a letter to a friend. QuickTime would let you call up a video of the pet in action, insert a sequence into the letter, and then dispatch the document electronically. It is the software tool that multimedia authors everywhere have been praying for.
The biggest prize in the burgeoning multimedia world looks like being interactive video, where the viewer can manipulate what he sees. Andrew Kessler, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says the combined world market for TV hardware, video programming, personal computers and video games is now over $150 billion. He guesses that by the late 1990s a third of this market will be dominated by interactive video.
There are only two big technological barriers for interactive video to cross. One is how to compress a digital signal to a level where it does not need 18 gigabytes of computer memory (enough to hold a library of 30,000 novels) just to store 30 minutes of television sitcom. That means compression--pruning out needless repetition. The standards for doing this already exist, and American firms are well ahead in building the special microchips to do all the work. Intel is out front with its DVI (Digital Video Interactive) devices. These are good at decompressing, but need a huge supercomputer to perform the compression part of the process. Several smaller Silicon Valley companies are also pursuing the same goal.
Apart from the special chips for doing the digital processing, America seems set to clear the other big hurdle in interactive video. It has an armlock on the software needed to keep everything neatly under control. Even Hollywood has a toe in the business--both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are involved in developing software programs for the interactive video market. Interactive Home Systems, a private company owned by Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has been buying up the licensing rights to paintings and art objects from museums. So has Eastman Kodak.
Nothing exemplifies the convergence of the American computer industry and the Japanese consumer-electronics industry as clearly as the co-operation between Apple and Sony. The two firms are the most innovative in their respective countries and fields and have worked together for several years. Though Sony has failed repeatedly to make it big in the computer business, it happily makes components for Apple--including a laptop version of the Macintosh called the Powerbook 100.
Two months ago Sony reportedly took a 5-6% stake in an Apple spin-off called General Magic; so apparently did Motorola, an American telecoms and electronics firm. General Magic is developing a ""personal communicator"" that combines the functions of a personal computer with those of a cellular telephone. This pocket-sized PDA will send and receive audio, video and text transmissions. Motorola is to supply the telecoms know-how, Sony the manufacturing skills and Apple some of the software that makes the device simple to use.
If collaboration between Japan's consumer-electronics firms and America's software and digital-processing wizards becomes important, who will be in charge? As more and more of the added value in consumer-electronics products shifts from hardware to software, pundits on both sides of the Pacific guess it will be the Americans. The number of Japanese electronics firms buzzing around Silicon Valley suggests that this may indeed be the case. ""They're scared,"" crows one Silicon Valleyite.
Perhaps. But one thing is worth remembering. The Japanese did not invent the VCR--Ampex, a Californian firm, did so in 1961. Yet Matsushita, JVC, Sony, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Sharp and half a dozen others simply out-developed, out-produced, out-marketed and finally out-lasted their American rivals. They could do it again."

With most people unable even to operate their video recorders properly, Japan's consumer-electronics industry is desperate to emulate Apple, too. All the more so now the next generation of consumer gadgets--so-called ""multimedia"" devices that merge words, photos, video, data and music--will be even more mind-boggling than today's.
Last month Apple said it was entering the consumer-electronics business--and was looking for Japanese partners. Its strategy is built around devices called Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Unlike personal computers, PDAs will perform specific tasks--as electronic diaries, multimedia players, personal communicators and the like. All will be hand-held, and will allow a user to look up information or communicate with others--either via the telephone line or through wireless telephones. Apple expects to introduce its first PDAs in 1993.
The one thing they all have in common is ease of use. This is because PDAs are digital--and therefore programmable like a computer. Clever software can then be used to take the complexity and drudgery out of getting them to work properly.
BYE BYE, MR BELL
CD players and digital-audio-tape (DAT) recorders apart, most consumer-electronics products on the market today are analogue--a technology, dating back to Alexander Graham Bell, which mimics sound or light with changes in voltage ""analogous"" to the waves it is evoking. This is one reason why the profit margins of Japan's consumer-electronics firms have become so thin. The quality of such analogies depends upon the quality of the electronic parts--the latter cannot shrink in price anything like as fast as digital ones when their production volumes are cranked up.
Making matters worse, Japanese consumer-electronics firms have failed to come up with any new hit products to wow the public. Nothing has come along in more than a decade to match the success of the VCR, whose sales are now tailing off. The new, pin-sharp high-definition television (HDTV) Sets will be big business once their price is slashed from today's $25,000. In the meantime Japan's consumer-electronics firms are pinning their hopes on a bunch of multimedia products to bridge the ""digital gap"" (see chart on next page). (Chart omitted)
The consumer-electronics industry is going digital for reasons of cheapness and flexibility as well as higher fidelity. In some applications, digital is the only way to handle the vast amounts of information involved--as in the case of the next generation of HDTV sets. Digital processing also allows the information to be conveyed in pristine condition, banishing squeaks and flashes. From America's point of view, the dash for digital plays to one of its more successful industries. It also plays to one of America's talents--writing innovative software.
Take Apple's latest software wizardry, called QuickTime. This lets a Macintosh synchronise up to 24 different channels of information--be they voice, video, data, fax or whatever--into a single recording or message. Imagine mentioning your new pet dog in a letter to a friend. QuickTime would let you call up a video of the pet in action, insert a sequence into the letter, and then dispatch the document electronically. It is the software tool that multimedia authors everywhere have been praying for.
The biggest prize in the burgeoning multimedia world looks like being interactive video, where the viewer can manipulate what he sees. Andrew Kessler, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says the combined world market for TV hardware, video programming, personal computers and video games is now over $150 billion. He guesses that by the late 1990s a third of this market will be dominated by interactive video.
There are only two big technological barriers for interactive video to cross. One is how to compress a digital signal to a level where it does not need 18 gigabytes of computer memory (enough to hold a library of 30,000 novels) just to store 30 minutes of television sitcom. That means compression--pruning out needless repetition. The standards for doing this already exist, and American firms are well ahead in building the special microchips to do all the work. Intel is out front with its DVI (Digital Video Interactive) devices. These are good at decompressing, but need a huge supercomputer to perform the compression part of the process. Several smaller Silicon Valley companies are also pursuing the same goal.
Apart from the special chips for doing the digital processing, America seems set to clear the other big hurdle in interactive video. It has an armlock on the software needed to keep everything neatly under control. Even Hollywood has a toe in the business--both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are involved in developing software programs for the interactive video market. Interactive Home Systems, a private company owned by Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has been buying up the licensing rights to paintings and art objects from museums. So has Eastman Kodak.
Nothing exemplifies the convergence of the American computer industry and the Japanese consumer-electronics industry as clearly as the co-operation between Apple and Sony. The two firms are the most innovative in their respective countries and fields and have worked together for several years. Though Sony has failed repeatedly to make it big in the computer business, it happily makes components for Apple--including a laptop version of the Macintosh called the Powerbook 100.
Two months ago Sony reportedly took a 5-6% stake in an Apple spin-off called General Magic; so apparently did Motorola, an American telecoms and electronics firm. General Magic is developing a ""personal communicator"" that combines the functions of a personal computer with those of a cellular telephone. This pocket-sized PDA will send and receive audio, video and text transmissions. Motorola is to supply the telecoms know-how, Sony the manufacturing skills and Apple some of the software that makes the device simple to use.
If collaboration between Japan's consumer-electronics firms and America's software and digital-processing wizards becomes important, who will be in charge? As more and more of the added value in consumer-electronics products shifts from hardware to software, pundits on both sides of the Pacific guess it will be the Americans. The number of Japanese electronics firms buzzing around Silicon Valley suggests that this may indeed be the case. ""They're scared,"" crows one Silicon Valleyite.
Perhaps. But one thing is worth remembering. The Japanese did not invent the VCR--Ampex, a Californian firm, did so in 1961. Yet Matsushita, JVC, Sony, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Sharp and half a dozen others simply out-developed, out-produced, out-marketed and finally out-lasted their American rivals. They could do it again."

Daimler-Benz took over most of Germany's aerospace industry; America's General Motors bought Hughes Aircraft. The idea was that snazzy aircraft technology could help make cars. It didn't. Fed up with waiting, some car makers have shed their wings. Ford and Chrysler sold their aerospace divisions in 1990. But in one case synergy has borne fruit. British Aerospace (BAe) bought a car company--and now it is the car men who are having to save the aircraft maker.
BAe has been having a tough time. Although its defence businesses remain profitable, its commercial aircraft, cars and property divisions have plunged into loss. On February 19th the company announced an L81m ($143m) loss on sales of L10.6 billion, compared with a pre-tax profit of L376m in 1990. That was grim, but within City expectations. It was just as well, because BAe is anxious to avoid any more nasty surprises--like its botched L432m rights issue last September which halved its share price and resulted in Sir Roland Smith being ousted as chairman; or the unexpected L79m which only last week BAe agreed to fork out to resolve a disputed property deal.
Sir Graham Day is confident the company is on top of its problems. Sir Graham was boss of Rover Group when BAe bought the car company for a subsidised song from a grateful British government in 1988. He is now chairman of Cadbury-Schweppes, a British foods group, but has stepped into Sir Roland's shoes as BAe's caretaker chairman until a new boss is appointed in the spring.
It is not the only vacant job at British Aerospace. Dudley Eustace, its finance director, has resigned. The future of Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, depends on successfully negotiating a multi-billion-dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia (see page 52). (Page 52 omitted). The management team has been further bolstered (or ""Roverised"", as some in the firm call it) by the appointment of George Simpson, chairman of Rover Group, to a new post as BAe's deputy chief executive.
Yet it is not just in the board room that the car makers have been giving their parent a helping hand. Staff from Rover have also been teaching their aerospace colleagues the secrets of so-called ""lean"" manufacturing techniques, which they have been using to transform some of the most notorious production lines in the car industry. Rover learnt those skills from Honda, the Japanese car company which owns 20% of the British firm's car-making operations.
Though Rover Group lost L52m before interest last year (compared with a L65m profit in 1990), Sir Graham maintains the car maker ""does not represent a serious downside for BAe"". Indeed, the profits from the firm's defence business added to the cash generated by Rover in the second half of the year helped greatly to improve BAe's liquidity. Some people in the industry expect that Honda will ultimately absorb Rover completely. The two firms recently strengthened their links and now plan to design three new models together.
Honda and others have also cast their eyes over BAe's profitable executive-jet business. Mr Evans says no offers have been made because ""it is not on the market"". Not yet, maybe. But BAe is planning to sell some businesses and hopes to find partners for others. It is talking to rivals, including Holland's Fokker and France's Aerospatiale, about collaborating with its loss-making regional aircraft operations, which include the 146 jet. Without a partner, BAe would have to quit the business. That would leave it building wings for Europe's Airbus Industrie, which is heavily subsidised and says it is profitable.
If the car makers cannot stage a rescue, BAe is unlikely to retain its independence. Lord Weinstock is watching and waiting. He is boss of GEC, and contemplated buying a stake in BAe at the time of the rights-issue fiasco. As a man with a military-industrial complex, Lord Weinstock's interest is BAe's defence businesses, which are big customers of GEC. The rest, apart from Rover, might have to seek their own salvation."

If true, these charges would amount to a formidable condemnation. Are they?
Russian prices increased 3-1/2-fold in the month after liberalisation on January 2nd. This figure--from the State Statistical Service--is lower than the guesses of most commentators, which range from a fivefold to a tenfold increase. The official figure understates the rise in the price of goods now being produced because much of what was sold in January came from existing stocks, prices of which merely doubled. Prices of newly produced goods rose by perhaps 400%.
Whatever the exact figure, it was greater than the Russian government had expected. It has not--yet--been so bad as to provoke any serious civil disobedience. But is it, as critics argue, ""too much""?
That depends, of course, on what ""too much"" means. In relation to wages, the rise has been dramatic. Average wages have doubled and, according to the Minister of Social Affairs, 80% of all Russians are now living below the poverty line.
But is price reform itself to blame? The cut in living standards had happened already, from 1985 to 1991. During that time, however, it showed up as ever-increasing shortages. Inflation was disguised by price controls while excess demand, created by large wage rises, ended up as a ""monetary overhang""--that is, the cash that would be spent on consumption if goods were freely available. Price liberalisation has simply ripped the veil from long-repressed excess demand. If there is any justification for this, it must be that the overhang is one of the main obstacles to reform. While it remains, macroeconomic stability cannot be achieved and ""structural"" reforms--privatisation and the rest--will fail.
So it is vital to ask whether the Russians have rid themselves of it. They have. On the eve of price liberalisation, the total monetary stock in Russia was around 730 billion roubles ($6.4 billion). GNP was then 1.4 trillion roubles. This ratio of money to GNP is an important indicator of an economy's financial stability. In the Soviet Union, it has been 1:2 or higher since 1985. A ""normal"" ratio in low-inflation, middle-income countries is about 1:3. So Russian levels have long been too high. To achieve a ratio of 1:3, prices would have needed only to double. As it is, the 3-1/2-fold increase reduced the monetary stock to 10% of GNP--a ratio of 1:10.
On this measure, critics are right that prices have risen ""too much"". But they are wrong to forget that the monetary overhang has been wiped out. Prices could now stabilise or even fall. Encouragingly, savings at Sberbank, the main savings bank, rose by 8 billion roubles in January, suggesting consumers, far from gitting rid of cash, are expecting lower inflation.
But prices can stabilise only if monetary and fiscal policies are tight. Here, the signs look less promising. On January 24th the Russian Parliament passed what was virtually a balanced budget for the first quarter of the year. Ten days later, it nearly halved the value-added tax (VAT), which is supposed to raise over half of government revenues, on a range of basic goods; it also raised pensions. On February 19th Boris Yeltsin announced further small increases in some pensions, student grants and military pay. All this has been interpreted as a decisive retreat from the government's stabilisation plans.
That is too gloomy. The increase in pensions, financed out of the emergency reserves, did not increase the deficit. The loss of revenue from VAT did--by some 2-3% of GNP. As a result, on pessimistic estimates, the deficit for the first quarter is likely to be around 7-8% of GNP. That still represents a tightening of fiscal policy compared with 1991's 17%.
Nor is monetary policy as loose as it seems. True, Russia displays the curious phenomenon of a government full of monetarists and a central bank full of Keynesians. But the growth in money supply did not soar in January as might have been expected; in fact it slowed down. And after decades of providing free finance to enterprises, the central bank has raised interest rates to 35-40%--lower than inflation, but the increase may help to restrain demand for credit.
It is too early to pronounce the reforms a success. But evidence does suggest that the Russian government has at least begun the immense task of stabilising a chaotic and inflationary economy in transition to capitalism, while at the same time opening it up to competition and private ownership. Whether the government can build on this over the coming months will depend on its ability to maintain monetary and fiscal controls in the face of several problems.
Reform is bound to reduce output by even more than it has fallen already, as loss-making firms close. This will cause further discontent, reduce tax revenues, increase social-security payments and put more pressure on fiscal policy. Strikes have barely begun. But if wage rises out-strip inflation, enterprises will either have to close yet more loss-making plants or be bailed out by the central bank.
In many developing countries, the inability to raise revenue has been as big a cause of budget deficits as profligate spending has. Russia faces this problem. Its tax system is primitive. In January, it collected only 20 billion of the 60 billion roubles it should have collected through VAT. Admittedly, no VAT at all was collected in the first two weeks, so, as the tax system began to gear up in the second half of the month, it did manage to meet two-thirds of its target. But it needs 100%.
Russia also faces the problem of whether price liberalisation can be achieved in a heavily monopolised economy. In November a parliamentary committee was given the power to approve in advance any price rises by monopoly enterprises from the beginning of January, or to limit the profitability of such firms. So far it has not used its power, but only because it is still working on a list of which companies count as monopolies. This list--which already contains nearly 2,000 names, accounting for an estimated 70% of industrial production--will be ready in March. That is when reformers will face the threat of the committee reimposing wholesale price controls."

They groan about being virtually doomed in advance by legal tangles, clapped-out plant, rotten infrastructure and wages soaring ahead of productivity. Not so, argues Reiner Pilz, an Ossi (eastern German) building engineer who fled west in 1961 and later made a fortune by diversifying into, among other thing, the compact-disc (CD) business.
Mr Pilz advises would-be investors to follow a couple of simple rules. First, forget the idea of picking up a bargain from the Treuhand, the body charged with privatising the east's former state-owned firms. What may seem a cheap buy can later prove ruinous if it means taking on antique factories and giving job guarantees. Instead, analyse the potential eastern market, build new plant, train your own workers and be prepared to pay them western rates from the start. Second, avoid setting up in or close to the main eastern cities, where land is costly and bureaucracy endemic. Choose a smaller spot and get the locals on your side.
That goes a long way to explain why Mr Pilz decided to build an ultra-modern CD factory at Albrechts, a village on the edge of the Thuringian forest, one of the east's wildest areas. Drawn by the prospect of jobs and a hefty injection of tax revenue, Albrechts's mayor pledged to take care of any local snags. That meant chasing up around 60 entities which had potential claims on the land where Mr Pilz aimed to build. It also involved bending rules, for instance to make sure the site quickly got a feeder-road.
The upshot is that the factory, with a projected annual output of 30m CDs, should be complete by the end of 1992 at a cost of nearly DM300m ($190m). It will employ around 300 people, 160 of them now under training at the Pilz headquarters in Kranzberg, north of Munich. They will be just as productive as their western counterparts, Mr Pilz says, when they adapt to the new technology and a non-communist rhythm of shorter hours but tougher work.
Does a Pilz-type plan ensure success? Despite its logic, not necessarily. For one thing, it is now harder to give bureaucrats the slip than it was amid the legal and administrative chaos of the early days of reunification. For another, the CD-factory scheme swiftly won political backing because it emerged from the first-ever joint venture between the two Germanies. Despite this, Mr Pilz had trouble drumming up enough finance for the Albrechts project, and scorns the play-safe attitude of the western German banks--a big hindrance, he reckons, to greater investment in the east by medium-sized firms such as his.
Mr Pilz made his way with a company called Pilz Metall + Glas, building the facades of ultra-modern buildings like the royal palace in Jeddah. Armed with expertise in combining coatings of different materials, he decided in the mid-1980s to get into the booming business of compact discs. His Kranzberg plant is now producing at its full capacity of 50m discs a year; hence the factory going up at Albrechts, as well as another, with an annual capacity of 100m, planned at Avila in Spain. Mr Pilz is also thinking about setting up in America.
Is Mr Pilz in danger of overreaching himself, or being squeezed out by larger CD-makers? The big firms tried to crush him before but now several are customers--because, Mr Pilz argues, he keeps his technological edge with constantly updated robotic production. To avoid dependence on outside orders, he also has his own labels, such as a ""Vienna Masters"" series, accounting for a quarter of production.
Analysts agree that the strategy has worked so far, but wonder whether the group, which is privately held by the Pilz family, will be able to generate enough capital to keep ahead of the giants. Mr Pilz seems to have been struck by the same thought: he is pondering going to the stockmarket in a couple of years."

Columbia signed up its first customer a few weeks ago, nearly three years after it first tried to launch a service. The process took that long not because of lack of demand for Columbia's wares, nor because of a lack of satellite capacity, but because of an endless tangle of red tape and the opposition of Intelsat, the consortium of 121 national telephone companies that clings to a virtual monopoly of the transmission of satellite signals between continents.
Originally, Columbia planned to buy and launch its own satellite. The market-minded Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the firm permission to do so in 1986. Then, in 1989, a cheaper opportunity appeared. Under pressure from the FCC, America's NASA decided to auction spare capacity on two of its own satellites for commercial use.
The result of the auction gave NASA a shock. Offering $61m for a six-year lease on the 24 transponders--12 on a NASA satellite over the Atlantic, 12 on another over the Pacific--Columbia topped the next-largest bid by $10m. But NASA preferred to do business with the loser of the auction, Intelsat, one of the biggest customers for NASA's space shuttle. Undaunted, Columbia took NASA to court. In January 1990 Columbia won its case, and NASA duly signed the lease.
That was not the end of Columbia's woes. Under treaty rules, Intelsat has the right to vet potential competitors. If it decides that a new rival might do it ""significant"" economic harm, or interfere with Intelsat's own broadcasts, it can refuse the firm permission to go into business. Unsurprisingly, Columbia got the thumbs down. Intelsat's official complaint was that it already had plans to locate a satellite of its own near NASA's Atlantic satellite, and that Columbia's service would interfere with it. In reality, Intelsat was probably more worried that Columbia would make it lower its prices. Intelsat charges $2,000-2,500 for an hour's worth of television transmission between Europe and America. Columbia plans to charge only $1,500.
In September 1991 the American government sided with Columbia, scotching Intelsat's objection. In January Columbia sold the use of some Pacific transponders to TRW, a defence firm that wants to get into satellite transmission. Now Columbia is busy looking for customers for its remaining capacity.
Given Columbia's story, it is unsurprising that few other firms have tried to break Intelsat's grip. Only one other independent satellite company, Alpha Lyracom, transmits signals across the Atlantic, and nobody but Intelsat and Columbia has a trans-Pacific service. Alpha Lyracom is still locked in lawsuits with Comsat, the company that markets Intelsat's satellite capacity to American firms. Orion, a privately-owned consortium planning to launch a satellite over the Atlantic in 1994, took four years to win the necessary permission. Anyone planning to follow in Columbia's footsteps had better call his lawyer first."

Two years ago it did the same for information services delivered over the telephone wires. This year the liberalisers are creeping up on the telecoms industry's innermost citadel--ordinary voice telephony. Expect a battle royal.
Today, in every EC country except Britain, basic voice telephony remains the monopoly of a single government-owned national carrier. Though other firms may run mobile services or build computer networks, the carriage of ordinary voice calls--97% of the $31 billion market in European telecoms services--is barred.
The charge for change is being led by Sir Leon Brittan, head of the competition directorate. As he may leave his job at the end of the year, he would like telephony deregulation to be his triumphant finale. In recent speeches he has castigated telephone companies for overpricing international calls. An inquiry into the matter, launched by Sir Leon two years ago, should report soon.
The commissioner in charge of the telecoms industry, Filippo Maria Pandolfi, may be less keen on change. In the past his department has been more sympathetic to producer interests than to consumer ones (as in last year's HDTV debacle). He also has the reputation of being more interested in research than in policy-making. With Sir Leon currently stealing the show, that may change. In a forthcoming reorganisation, Mr Pandolfi will move most of his researchers to another department, freeing up jobs for more regulatory experts.
To push through his new directive, Sir Leon needs to beat a squad of heavyweight vested interests. Telephone firms argue that they need their monopolies to fulfil public-service duties. To strengthen their moral position, many have slashed international call prices. In January Deutsche Telekom said it would cut transatlantic call prices by 20-40%. France Telecom has cut the price of peak-time calls to Asia and America by 18%. Equipment-makers like Alcatel and Siemens lobby on the telephone companies' side. Although liberalisation would expand the industry by letting foreign carriers into Europe, it would also give foreign equipment-makers a foot in the door.
Worried about manufacturing jobs, many governments sympathise. Although member governments will not technically have a say in the new directive, they can, if they wish, make a lot of fuss. When 1988's equipment law was passed, France took the commission to court over its use of Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome, which allow the commission to make legislation without a vote in the Council of Ministers. Though the case was settled in the commission's favour two years later, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Greece brought a similar suit over 1990's information-services directive. First hearings are not due until March.
To placate everybody, the commission is looking for a compromise. Preliminary hints are that new competitors will be allowed to carry only international, not domestic, calls and will have to rent lines from the national carrier, rather than being allowed to lay lines of their own.
It may take years for new rules to bite. Neither Greece, Italy or Ireland has yet turned 1990's information-services directive into law. Though 1988's equipment directive has brought about a fall in prices, lots of restrictive business practices--like complicated standards tests--persist. Sir Leon's successor will have plenty of work left to do."

His old Renault is on its last wheels and he wanted to benefit from Belgium's cheap car prices before returning to Britain next year. He found that Renault dealers were selling Clio RT hatchbacks for BFr341,400, before tax. That is the equivalent of L5,750 ($10,070), compared with a pre-tax price of L7,519 in Britain.
The smile was wiped off your correspondent's face when he tried to order a right-hand-drive Clio. Renault said that the only right-hand-drive model it could supply in Belgium was one destined for the British market--at the British price.
Recital of a ruling by the European Court of Justice in 1985 failed to move Renault. This ruling came about when Ford refused to supply its German dealers with right-hand-drive vehicles. The court compelled it to do so, opening the way (in theory) for cross-Channel shoppers to buy right-hand-drive cars at prices close to those charged for left-hand-drive versions.
Renault argues that its right-hand-drive Clio RT includes features--fuel injection, tinted windows, a sun roof and so on--that are optional on left-hand-drive models. Frills like these do not begin to justify such a vast price differential.
Some manufacturers are less openly contemptuous of European law. Hatchbacks like Volkswagen's Polo or Peugeot's 106XT, for instance, cost about L2,000 less in Brussels than in London, before tax. To that, Belgian Volkswagen dealers then add on only BFr25,000 (L420) for the inconvenience of supplying a right-hand-drive car; Peugeot dealers add BFr35,000.
The manufacturers may be about to suffer a rude shock. In 1985 the European Commission allowed them to retain their system of exclusive dealerships which, according to consumer groups, helps to maintain cross-border price differentials. In return, the car makers had to promise that this system would not lead to cross-border price differences of more than 12%--and that they would not impede individuals seeking cross-border purchases.
The European Bureau of Consumers Unions (BEUC, by its French initials), an EC consumer lobby, has repeatedly complained that car companies have abused this agreement. So the commission's competition directorate decided to investigate EC car prices. Its report has just reached Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner--and reveals starker price differences than did the lame report earlier this month from Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the same subject.
A mighty row is brewing. Sir Leon is mulling over the report and will probably publish it next month. Consumer groups hope that he will take that opportunity to propose an end to exclusive car dealerships. But Jacques Delors, the commission president, and Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, would probably resist such a move on the grounds that it would cut into the profits of an already troubled industry.
Renault and Peugeot-Citroen are lobbying for the commission to make it harder for consumers to import new cars from another EC country. Otherwise, they fear, the Community's complex deal with Japan--involving national import quotas for Japanese cars--would become unworkable.
The French car companies are already smarting from Sir Leon's first blow to the dealership system. A Rouen-based firm called Ecosystem had bought Peugeots in Belgium and Luxembourg and sold them in France through the Carrefour supermarket chain. Peugeot had banned its dealers from selling to Ecosystem. Last July the European Court ruled against Peugeot, and in December Sir Leon issued new rules: intermediaries may buy specific cars for named clients across EC borders as long as they do not act like dealers. Sir Leon now needs to deliver his knock-out punch, preferably before this correspondent leaves Brussels."

For years he spurned a long line of suitors keen for the hand of his record company, Virgin Music. Their proposals were enticing--and generous. As recently as last summer Mr Branson turned up his nose at offers of $500m for the group, which made pre-tax profits in 1990 (the last year it published results) of L23m ($38m) on sales of L309m. But as bidders became more indulgent, Mr Branson became more flirtatious, nearly selling the firm late last year for $750m to one of the big six ""major"" record companies that together account for 80% of the $22 billion global music market.
Now the serious courtship has begun. in January Mr Branson started negotiating with two potential buyers, both of which own ""majors"": Germany's Berteismann, the world's second-biggest media conglomerate (after Time Warner), and Britain's Thorn EMI, a records-to-lighting group. Berteismann and Thorn EMI will neither confirm nor deny it, but somebody close to the talks says both companies are drafting formal proposals and contracts to submit to Mr Branson. What's more, the same person says that one of the two Japanese companies that own big record companies--Sony or Matsushita--recently joined the bidding. Industry gossips whisper it is Matsushita.
All three bidders are offering more than $1 billion. But the structures of the proposals differ--one close to a traditional takeover, the others more like joint ventures. Each would include a big chunk of cash (or a mixture of cash and shares) up front, plus a multiple of future earnings. Ideally, however, Mr Branson wants to keep a stake in the company, at least for a time; he also wants its top management to stay in place. Indeed, insiders say Mr Branson might turn away the highest bid in favour of a lower one that allows him to hang on to some control.
Who has the most to gain from the deal, whatever its form? Mr Branson, surely: if he gets his price he will have seen the value of Virgin Music almost double since he sold a 25% stake in 1989 to Fujisankei, a Japanese media group, for $170m. Nonetheless, $1 billion is well below the $1.8 billion tag he recently put on his music business. But Mr Branson needs money for his airline, Virgin Atlantic. An infusion of cash from the music deal and a planned sale of a 20% stake in Virgin Atlantic will help Mr Branson add routes and pay down debts.
Virgin's mooted buyers need Mr Branson as much as he needs them. Since 1988 the music industry has seen a dramatic consolidation, as the big six record companies have gobbled up every independent label in sight (see table). As competition among them has grown more intense, some of the big firms have paid exaggerated prices to maintain market share. Matsushita's entertainment arm, MCA, bought Geffen Records for $545m; Thorn EMI paid $150m for Chrysalis and $285m for SBK; Polygram, the music wing of Philips, a Dutch electronics firm, devoured A&M and Island for a total of $750m.
Virgin is the last dish left--though as the world's seventh-biggest record company (with 6% of the market), it is no mere canape. Its artist roster--Phil Collins, Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson and (starting next year) the Rolling Stones--makes it appealing to all the bidders. Each has other reasons, too:
* BERTELSMANN MUSIC GROUP (BMG) is perhaps the most desperate. Its purchase of RCA Records in 1986 has gone badly and BMG's once-hot Arista label has gone cold. Though strong in Europe, BMG'S American market share has slid to 10%, and the firm has fallen from third to fifth among the big six. ""They're getting slaughtered for lack of English-language hits,"" says Emanuel Gerard, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison, a New York stockbroker. ""They need a deal like they need life itself.""
* For THORN EMI, buying Virgin would catapult the group into the industry's top tier, alongside Time Warner and Sony. The company's market share has gone from 9% to 14% in the past three years on the back of successes such as Hammer, a rap artist, Garth Brooks, a country crooner, and Wilson Phillips, a Californian girl group. Julie Farrar, an analyst at County NatWest in London, reckons pre-tax profits for Thorn's music division in the year to March will be L124m, a 15% rise. The company has been sniffing round Virgin for some time and would probably be amenable to a joint venture; it may have the inside track.
* MATSUSHITA'S MCA, if it is a bidder, is the smallest of the big six, with under 10% of the market. Unlike BMG, however, it is strong in America and weak abroad. Virgin, which gets most of its sales from Europe and Japan, would help rectify that.
Like all the independent record companies bought before it, Virgin is attractive for another reason: it has no manufacturing plants or distribution network. The big six do; thus any buyer would simply push Virgin's products through its own system. That explains why independent labels routinely fetch sums as high as 30 times earnings. Once taken over by a major, their profit margins should, in theory, nearly double.
In practice, however, things have gone rather differently. Instead of streamlining their operations as they grew, the majors got bloated, keeping too many staff and signing too many artists. Then recession hit. After growing by more than 10% a year since the introduction of compact discs in 1983, sales were flat in the first half of last year. As a result, gloom shrouds hitsville. Scores of employees have been sacked by the big record companies. At EMI Records a plan to combine the marketing, promotions and sales operations of the firm's three main labels means that 150 of its 350 staff will have to go. This makes sense. But it does nothing about an even more irrational cost: the soaring price of top talent. A slew of long-term mega-deals last year--Michael Jackson ($100m), sister Janet ($30m), Aerosmith ($35m), Motley Crue ($25m)--is evidence that the music business is becoming more like its celluloid sister, Hollywood. Instead of investing modestly and hoping unknowns will ""break big"", record companies are pouring resources into superstars. Given pop fans' fickle taste, that is an even bigger gamble than it has proved in Tinseltown.

To put this another way, the dollar is today worth only 10 cents in 1933 money, and the pound is really worth a paltry 2-1/2p. Even the supposedly cast-iron D-mark has lost two-thirds of its value since it replaced the worthless Reichsmark in 1948.
Since prices have risen almost continuously since 1933, most people today expect that prices will continue to rise every year. In fact history shows that inflation is far from ""normal"".
The charts show consumer prices from 1661 in Britain and from 1820 in America and Germany. Official figures do not exist that far back, but various series (of admittedly varying quality) can be linked together to give a broad picture of price movements over the centuries. Typically, the older indices covered only food and housing, and excluded services.
In the years before 1933, prices fell in Britain and America in more years than they rose. The longest unbroken period of rising prices in both America and Britain lasted only six years. Germany's hyperinflation in 1922-23 (when the inflation rate was over 1 billion %) is well known. More interesting is the fact that unlike America and Britain, where prices drifted downwards during the 19th century, in Germany prices doubled.
After falling by 40% between 1820 and 1900, American prices more than doubled during the first world war. But by the early 1930s the average price-level had fallen back to its level in 1820.
The British figures, covering the longest period, are the most revealing. During the three centuries to 1933, there were only six occasions when prices increased for more than three years in a row, mostly during wars, when government borrowing soared. Prices peaked in 1813, during the Napoleonic wars, but by the end of the 19th century had more than halved again. As in America, prices surged during 1914-20 but then fell back. By 1933 prices in Britain were hardly changed from their 1660s levels.
Although it is true to say that Britain's general price level was broadly stable over the three centuries as a whole, the annual inflation rate was highly volatile from one year to another, with rates of plus or minus 10% quite common. Today, when economists talk about price stability being the only sensible goal for central banks, they mean that the price level should be stable from one year to the next, not just over a decade or so.
So far as economic growth is concerned, the volatility of inflation matters as much as its level. An inflation rate which averages 0%, but which swings from plus to minus 10%, is as damaging as one that swings between 10% and 30%--the more volatile inflation is, the more uncertainty it creates, and this discourages investment. Moreover, even if prices are broadly stable over a period as a whole, falling prices are bad for investment and growth. Nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero, so falling prices result in painfully high real interest rates.
Price stability, however, is not necessarily the same as zero inflation as measured by consumer-price indices. These indices, which measure the weighted average of price changes for a fixed basket of goods and services, tend to overstate the true rate of inflation for two reasons.
* First, they do not adjust fully for improvements over time in the quality of goods and services. Some of the rise in a price index may reflect better-quality hi-fi equipment, say, rather than general cost pressures.
* Second, in many countries the weights used to combine the different goods are often out of date. Britain updates its weights every year, but in America they are revised only every ten years (the current index is based on 1982-84); Germany's index is based on 1985. This exaggerates price rises over time, as it does not allow for changes in consumption patterns in response to changes in prices--consumers shift away from goods that are becoming comparatively more expensive towards cheaper alternatives.
So would you recognise price stability today if you saw it? Central banks, such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, define price stability as 0-2% inflation. A zero inflation rate reported by officialdom may in fact imply falling prices."

Main Street has much to teach Manhattan, claim Andersen Consulting, Coopers & Lybrand and IBM. To improve productivity, profitability and quality in a fundamental way, companies must strip out underlying operating inefficiencies, not just sack the odd employee. This means redesigning completely the way work flows through an organisation: in a word, ""re-engineering"" the business.
Wall Street is listening, and well it might. Repeated attempts to cut costs since the stockmarket crash in 1987 have reduced the number of employees in the securities business by 17% but made little impact on operating costs. Moody's, a rating agency, reckons that these are still more than three times as high in real terms as in 1980.
The heart of the task is to reorganise information systems. The increase in computing power over the past ten years created new products and markets by the bucketful. These prompted huge increases in investment in computer systems and supporting infrastructure.
Wall Street's spending on technology grew by almost 20% a year through the 1980s, to an estimated $7.5 billion last year. That is more than the combined pre-tax profits of securities firms in any year. Costs and systems spiralled without providing commensurate productivity gains. Re-engineering promises to impose order on both.
For securities firms, it means integrating front and back offices (rather as car makers have tried to bring design and assembly closer together). It also implies lowering processing costs by eliminating repetitive paper-based tasks. The result: getting closer to customers, the biggest of whom will otherwise be increasingly inclined to bypass securities firms, investing directly or through electronic off-exchange networks.
Investment banks like Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars to integrate their diversified, far-flung businesses, and still have much to do. Only then will it be clear whether the money was well spent.
At the big retail brokerages, where margins are under pressure and there are heavy processing costs to attack, the benefits of reengineering are likely to be seen first. Merrill Lynch, Kidder Peabody, PaineWebber and Shearson Lehman Brothers are all overhauling their operations. None dares hang back, lest it be left at a permanent cost disadvantage to its rivals. Nor can discount brokers like Charles Schwab (one-third of the way through a six-year project), if they want to stay competitive.
Merrill Lynch has stolen a technological march on the others with its Advanced Order Entry (AOE) system, which went on stream in November. All the firm's 10,500 American brokers can now enter orders for listed stocks directly from their workstations. Brokers used to pass a ticket to a wire operator, who keyed in the order to the processing system that sent it to an exchange. Instead, AOE now sends the order directly to the exchange and brings it back once it is executed.
This achievement has big implications. The one the customer sees is better service. A Merrill broker can execute and confirm a trade in the course of a telephone call: a deal which used to take up to ten minutes, during which time prices could move, can now be processed in less than one. While rivals like Shearson and PaineWebber rush to catch up, Merrill is preparing to extend its system to over-the-counter stocks and derivatives. Kidder Peabody, too, has started to automate over-the-counter deals. Meanwhile, the electronic exchange NASDAQ is redesigning its software to help firms enter orders automatically.
The new systems should reduce not only the time but the cost of trading. Merrill Lynch spent $200m over three years developing AOE, and predicts that it will start to pay for itself within another two.
Some of the savings will come from eliminating back-office jobs. Merrill got rid of 500 wire-room clerks, and broke with Wall Street tradition by requiring brokers to do the clerical work themselves. More savings should stem ftom another idea borrowed from manufacturing: ""zero-defect"" production. The software behind the screens will be able to check for entry mistakes, like mistyped account numbers. It can also be made to run compliance checks, to verify that a transaction meets investor protection rules. Real-time risk-management measures could be run on individual traders. All this should weed out much duff, illegal and unnecessarily risky business.
Opening new accounts is in for the same speedy face-lift. At Merrill Lynch, a salesman enters the necessary information into a workstation. This transmits the data to a processing centre, where an ""expert system"" draws up a document sent to the client to sign and return. The signed form is scanned and stored in an electronic archive; the paper is thrown away. What used to take a week can now be handled overnight.
Merrill Lynch has secured a competitive advantage that rivals have no choice but to try to duplicate. Charles Schwab is one that is exploring another avenue: standardising systems that have developed over the years but cannot talk to each other, and extracting advantage from it once they can.
It was common in the 1980s for firms to build separate back-office systems for, say, futures and options. Re-engineering removes duplicated costs. The application of new technologies like relational databases makes it possible to extract information from customers' accounts, real-time pricing feeds and firms' inventories, for example, to create new reporting and risk-management tools. Schwab is now able to check in the course of the day on the collateral positions of customers who are trading on margin, for example, thus reducing the risks it runs.
Tomorrow's technology promises even more. Improved versions of computer-aided software engineering (CASE), for example, which can help applications to improve themselves automatically, are starting to appear. Wall Street's seers also expect artificial intelligence to start making the inroads in their industry that it has already made in insurance and manufacturing.

Another Phillips & Drew employee, Christopher Stainforth, was found not guilty.

Four other defendants face a second trial, but the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) may well scrap that.
When summing up, the judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, directed the jury to strike out most of the charges brought by the SFO and concentrate solely on the conclusion to Blue Arrow's rights issue. That issue, worth L837m ($1.4 billion), was Britain's largest ever at the time. On the evening of September 28th 1987, directors of County and Phillips & Drew met to consider the results. Institutions had taken up only 38% of the rights. If County were to require sub-underwriters to buy the remainder, its reputation would suffer enormously.
So the advisers bought some of the unsold shares themselves. They announced that 49% of the issue had been taken up and the rest successfully sold in a placing. The advisers ended up, in fact, with about 13.5% of Blue Arrow's capital (worth about L150m). County NatWest and its market maker, County NatWest Securities, each took just under 5% of Blue Arrow. Phillips & Drew took about 4%, covered by an indemnity from County against potential losses. The firms thought they had got round the Companies Act requirement that any corporate stake of more than 5% be disclosed.
The judge told the jury to consider whether, by buying shares after the closure of the rights issue, the defendants had intentionally misled the markets. The defence had argued that this share buying was not a conspiracy; that it had not been for personal gain but for the support of a client; and that such practice was common in the City. The judge hinted that he thought the defendants innocent. The jury, however, accepted the prosecution's argument that the defendants had rigged the market.
The judge gave the guilty suspended sentences and said that the year-long trial had put an unacceptable strain on the jury, the defendants, their families and himself. ""Many lessons have to be learnt if trial by jury is to survive in a case like this,"" he said, echoing the grumbles a week earlier of Mr Justice Henry, to whose lot the Guinness trials had fallen.
Mr Justice McKinnon clearly felt--and he was not alone--that the prosecution deserved some of the blame for the length of the trial. The SFO tabled a large number of charges against more defendants than was necessary. The prosecution spun out its case in elaborate detail, calling on 92 witnesses. They might have done better to concentrate on the essential issues of market manipulation and lack of disclosure; in the event, the prosecution made a hash of the latter and stirred the judge to strike off charges relating to the Phillips & Drew indemnity and the market maker's holding.
Other charges fell interestingly wide of the mark. The defendants were accused, for instance, of withholding information from the Bank of England and from Natwest. But it emerged during the trial that directors of both NatWest and the Bank of England had known about the secret parcelling-up of Blue Arrow shares from the start.
The long, expensive messiness of the Blue Arrow case has fuelled criticism of the way in which fraud is prosecuted in Britain, leading some to conclude that criminal trial by jury is inappropriate. That is to misread its lessons. Fraud poses a serious threat to the reputation of the City of London. To protect that reputation, those who treat the rules in a cavalier manner should--if the offence is grave enough--face the deterrent of a criminal trial by jury. The SFO will learn from experience to simplify its prosecutions. The Blue Arrow jury acquitted itself admirably, even if it had to give up an amazing amount of time to do so."

Ten years ago Lloyd's seemed riddled with crooks, yet the ""names"" who provide its capital complained little--because most were making profits. Now that many face huge losses, cries of skulduggery have multiplied. Yet reforms in the 1980s mean that Lloyd's is much cleaner than it was.
Some of the loudest moaners are among the 50-odd Conservative members of Parliament who are names. They are wailing for better investor protection or market management. So where were they in the 1980s? Many were fighting (successfully) to preserve Lloyd's tradition of self-rulation and give it immunity from most lawsuits. It would be hard to find a clearer case of people being hoist with their own petards.
The MPs' agitation has produced three related chunks of bad publicity for Lloyd's:
* INSIDERS V OUTSIDERS. The claim that names who work in the market do better than those outside it is ages old--which does not mean it is untrue. It would be troubling if those who worked in insurance never knew more than those who did not.
Yet there is no hard evidence that ""baby syndicates"", for which underwriters creamed off the best of their business, have returned after being banned in the early 1980s. An analysis in the recent Rowland report on Lloyd's future showed that in two of the three most recent years to have reported, from 1986 to 1988, working names actually did worse than outsiders. Not all accept those numbers, however, and Lloyd's may find it hard to avoid an inquiry into the insider issue, partly because of
* THE EXCESS OF LOSS SPIRAL. One lot of syndicates that insiders avoided was the excess-of-loss set, notably Feltrim, Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire. They offered high-risk catastrophe reinsurance that proved hugely expensive when disasters like the Piper Alpha explosion and Hurricane Hugo struck. Worse, the risks were repeatedly reinsured within Lloyd's in a spiral that gave big commissions to brokers but little protection to names.
Many of these names are planning to sue, alleging either negligence, or that the reinsurance contracts were invalid, or both. They hope for useful ammunition from a report on Feltrim's losses that is due shortly. They were heartened when names won much of what they wanted in the recent Outhwaite settlement. Perhaps most troubling for Lloyd's, a number are now refusing to pay cash calls to meet losses, creating
* THE LIQUIDITY PROBLEM. Claims that Lloyd's is running out of cash are exaggerated. Its bosses say it is better-reserved than most insurance companies. Yet there have been contacts between names (and perhaps other market figures) and the Bank of England, which wants to avoid any risk of a Lloyd's syndicate failing to meet its claims.
If names do not pay losses, or if they win an injunction on February 24th to stop Lloyd's drawing down 600 names' deposits, syndicates will turn to the market's L500m ($875m) central fund. But total losses for the next two years could be five times that. Some names will have to cough up if Lloyd's is to pay all its policy-holders.
To the market's management, the bad publicity must seem an annoying distraction from the task of implementing the important and complex changes recommended by the Rowland report. But dealing with the issues that moaning MPs have (rightly or wrongly) raised is in fact far more pressing. Should Lloyd's ever lose the world's confidence that it will pay up no matter what, its future could fade altogether."

In theory, investors buy equity to have a share in companies' earnings. Companies either pass these on directly in the form of dividends; or, if firms retain earnings to invest in new projects, shareholders take their rewards indirectly in the form of capital gains. The challenge for investors is to judge what firms are really earning.
Even within the accounting rules of one country, companies find plenty of ways to adjust their earnings up or down--which is why both America and Britain have tightened their rules recently. International comparisons are even harder. Untroubled by the threat of takeover, German and Japanese companies tend to understate profits and so escape taxes; British and American firms are sufficiently nervous of their shareholders to prefer the opposite approach. Some recent work by Smithers & Co, a London research boutique, attempts to tackle these distortions.
Andrew Smithers begins this labour with Japan. Despite the recent fall in Tokyo's market, investors are still willing to pay much more for a given stream of Japanese earnings than for the same stream in other big economies: Tokyo's market sells on a price/earnings ratio of 36.7, compared with 25.6 for Wall Street's S&P industrial index and 15.5 for London's FT-A 500 index. The most obvious justification is that Japanese earnings are expected to grow faster than those of other companies, so bringing temporarily high ratios down. Yet the p/e ratios still seem astronomical: the growth in Japan's corporate earnings, though high, has been less remarkable than the growth of its economy.
Mr Smithers sets out to explain Japan's p/e ratios by adjusting them for the effect of cross-shareholdings. On his reckoning, 45% of the shares in Tokyo's market are beneficially owned by another quoted company. To own the entire market, therefore, an investor needs only to buy 55% of it: Tokyo is really 45% cheaper than its market capitalisation.
This affects Japan's p/e ratios, because the overstatement of the market's price is not matched by an equivalent overstatement of earnings. As in most countries, Japanese companies do not consolidate earnings of subsidiaries of which they own less than 20%. Mr Smithers therefore calculates that Tokyo's true p/e is 57% of the stated one.
This adjustment helps make Japanese p/e ratios comparable with those of other markets. To build on this start, Mr Smithers considers the different accounting procedures by which firms calculate their profits. One big variable is the rate at which capital is depreciated. Many German firms write off their capital quickly, during which time their profits are misleadingly small; subsequently they are artificially inflated. In America and Britain firms tend to mislead in the opposite direction.
To get round these problems, Mr Smithers turns to national accounts. These show rates of capital consumption: for Japan it is around 14.5% of GDP, for America it is 10.5%. These numbers reflect unquoted companies as well as quoted ones; but at least national statisticians are impartial. Besides, national accounts reduce the distortions of inflation. They record the cost of replacing exhausted capital, whereas company accounts amortise the original cost of installing it. Company practice therefore conceals the weakness of firms in high-inflation countries, whose replacement cost of capital rises faster than that of their low-inflation rivals.
Inflation also bedevils international comparison by boosting the value of inventories (stocks). Companies often enter such boosts as profit. Yet the cost of replacing stocks rises too, so these ""profits"" are illusory. Since inflation varies across countries, this artificial boost varies as well. But national accounts quantify stock appreciation, so Mr Smithers is able to measure this distortion.
Taking capital depreciation and stock appreciation together, Mr Smithers arrives at a factor by which company earnings should be adjusted to make them comparable from country to country. In Germany no adjustment is needed. In Britain, by contrast, reported profits should be multiplied by a factor of 0.75, because of inventive accountants and a history of inflation.
The last step towards internationally comparable ratios is to reflect economic cycles. Investors naturally pay more for shares at the start of a recovery, when they expect company earnings to grow faster. Mr Smithers adjusts the profits of companies in each market to compensate for this cyclical bias.
The results are summarised in the table. They make the discrepancies between market valuations look less alarming: the ratio between the highest and lowest p/e comes down by nearly half. They also make most markets look overvalued. Investors have historically expected total real returns of 6% a year from equities. Since returns, whether derived ftom dividends or capital gains, stem from earnings, investors should expect earnings per share to be 6% of the share's value too. That implies a p/e of 16.7. On this measure, France is the only big market that looks worth buying.
FUTURE LABOURS
Mr Smithers admits that his work is unfinished. It is not just Japan's market that is inflated by crossholdings; Germany's is probably 20-25% smaller than it appears to be. German p/e multiples may be less distorted, partly because subsidiaries' earnings are more often consolidated, and partly because Germany's modest dividend payouts are nonetheless more generous than Japan's minuscule ones. The bigger the dividend, the more the double counting of market price that results from cross-shareholdings is matched by double counting of earnings, since dividends boost the parent company's revenues.
As long as the Smithers recalculation is incomplete, most investment managers will carry on happily without him. County Natwest Investment Management, for example, says it prefers history to comparison: the past behaviour of a market illuminates its future more than cross-border accounting. Yet investors are growing more international, markets more intertwined. Increasingly, genuine differences in p/e ratios will be seized upon by arbitragers. There should be plenty of appetite for theories that distinguish genuine differences from accounting ones."

Finance-ministry officials have begun a special audit of the country's eight specialist housing-loan companies. These were set up in the 1960s to provide mortgages to individuals at a time when banks were not interested. When the banks changed their minds during the credit boom of the late 1980s, the housing-loan companies began to lend heavily to property developers and the like. Graeme McDonald, a Tokyo-based property analyst at James Capel, estimates that at least 50% of their outstanding loans are to property companies.
Some Y200 billion ($1.6 billion), or 1.6% of the housing-loan companies' total loans of Y12.6 trillion, are reckoned to be non-performing by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily. If the definition of non-performing is reduced from 12 months without payment of interest to six, the dodgy debt doubles to Y400 billion. James Capel reckons the true figure is closer to Y1 trillion. But even if only 1.6% of their loans are in trouble, that is still far more than the 0.3% (excluding third-world debt) of bad debts to which the city (big commercial) banks have admitted.
One of the worst hit of the housing-loan companies is Juso. Originally set up by the seven top trust banks with capital of Y800 billion, it too began a few years ago to lend heavily to property developers. By late last year its financial problems had become acute. The company demanded that its trust-bank owners reduce its interest payments and forgive some of its Y2 trillion of debt. Since the trust banks' investment in Juso is equivalent to 23% of their total capital, they had little option but to agree.
Juso is one of the four main creditors of Sueno Kosan, an Osaka property company that was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy earlier this month. Two others are also housing-loan companies: Nippon Jutaku Kinyu, a public company owned by several city banks, and Japan Housing Loan, a private company whose main bank is the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).
Sueno Kosan had group debts of Y650 billion at the end of last May. Because the company could not sell any of its properties to repay its borrowings, its four main creditors agreed this month to take property worth 100 billion instead. That the main creditors preferred to take collateral rather than have Sueno Kosan dump assets in a distress sale shows how terrified everyone is to rock the property market, a process from which the banks would be the biggest losers.
A hint of just how bad the portfolios of the housing-loan companies may be is provided by the results recently announced by Nichiei Finance, a Tokyo mortgage-guarantee company. Nichiei Finance became a public company in January last year and shocked investors in December when it decided to make a virtue of honesty. It announced an addition to loan-loss reserves of Y4.5 billion to guard against bad debts to property companies. The news caused the company's share price to plunge by 75%.
The shares of Nichiei Finance now sell for less than their net asset value--still a rare occurrence in Japan, despite the stockmarket crash. Investors fear the company will go bankrupt; yet this seems unfair. Its problem loans account for less than 5% of assets; a miffed Nichiei Finance has been telling securities analysts that it knows of non-bank competitors where problem loans are more than 40%. In fact, the only difference between Nichiei Finance and other financial institutions may be that it has--perhaps naively--admitted its problems.
Ultimately, the bad debts of the housing-loan companies (as of other non-banks, equally dependent on banks for their financing) will become the problem of their main banks. Where there is no clear main bank, the major shareholders or business associates will be made to take responsibility. The main shareholders of Nippon Jutaku Kinyu are Sanwa Bank and Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank. They had each lent more than Y200 billion to the company at the end of September. IBJ had lent it another Y140 billion.
These liabilities simply add to the banks' own mounting debt troubles. Despite the lack of loan-loss reserves and of reliable data, investors are at last waking up to the problem. Bank shares have fallen by about a third since the end of September."

That loyalty, plus independence of government secured by law, guaranteed the German central bank much of its authority for nearly four decades. Not any more--to judge from Helmut Schlesinger's bumpy first half-year as Bundesbank president.
Part of the trouble is that Mr Schlesinger is only an interim boss. He took over last August from Karl Otto Pohl (who fled to a possibly less gruelling and undoubtedly better paid job in private banking) and is due to hand over next year to his deputy, Hans Tietmeyer. That alone tends to give him less clout than other Bundesbank chiefs, who are normally appointed for eight years. Still, most pundits expected Mr Schlesinger to run a tight ship. He has been an insider at the Bundesbank (and at its predecessor, the Bank Deutscher Lander) since 1950, and is a hawkish monetarist who has rarely ducked a scrap with spendthrift governments in Bonn.
The first sign the pundits were wrong was the decision by the Bundesbank council in December to raise the key discount and Lombard rates by a full half-point--a move widely interpreted at the time as evidence that the new boss was indeed tough. Typical of Mr Schlesinger, many argued, to risk over-killing inflation (hovering around 4%) despite squawks at home and abroad that German interest rates were already too high. In fact, Mr Schlesinger had pleaded during the secret council meeting for a smaller rise in the Lombard rate, but he and his allies were narrowly outvoted. No great drama to outsiders, perhaps: the council had agreed that a rise was needed, and differed only on how by a rise it should be. But to insiders, a president who finds himself on the losing side in a council vote is bound to suffer a serious, possibly fatal, loss of authority. The wily Mr Pohl, half-admiringly called by a colleague ""as slippery as a Japanese westler"", was generally able to make sure that no vote would be taken if he was in any danger of losing it.
It is odd, you might think, that a man who has been at the Bundesbank for decades should misjudge the balance of power on the policy-making council. Not really. Mr Schlesinger is a respected economist and administrator who has made his career at central-bank headquarters. But the council comprises members of the bank's permanent directorate plus the heads of the Bundesbank's offshoots in the Lander, the regional states. Forming a consensus among that politically and intellectually diverse bunch was never easy. Mr Pohl did it better than most, thanks to long experience on the political treadmill in Bonn before he went to the Bundesbank in the 1970s. Nowadays it is tougher than ever. The make-up of the council has gradually been shifting more to the Lander's advantage (there are now only five directors to 11 regional ""princes""); and the Lander themselves are agonising over what German and European unity will mean for their long-cherished powers.
This helps to explain the revolt against the Bundesbank leadership over the European Union treaties agreed to in Maastricht in December. Both Mr Schlesinger and Mr Tietmeyer were quick to welcome the monetary side of the agreements. They said that the essential elements of an independent, inflation-fighting European central bank had been included. Bundesbank officials privately went further, arguing that more of Germany's stringent demands had been accepted in Maastricht than they had thought possible. But provincial chieftains like Lothar Muller of Bavaria, Wilhelm Nolling of Hamburg and Reimur Jochimsen of North Rhine-Westphalia beg to differ.
They are livid about what Helmut Kohl, the chancellor; calls the ""irreversibility"" of the monetary-union schedule. Many of them also reckon Mr Kohl took the Bundesbank (especially its president) for a ride, pretending to consult it but really putting it into a position where it could hardly say no to the results. Mr Kohl's men do not deny there is something in that, but argue that the Bundesbank got what it said it wanted all the same.
Faced with these charges, the Bundesbank's leaders decided after all to make public an unfriendly appraisal of the Maastricht accords--albeit discreetly buried in the regular monthly report for February. Discretion proved impossible when word got around that a Bundesbank bombshell might be in the offing. To try to head off more speculation, Mr Schlesinger presented the appraisal himself at a press conference. That guaranteed wide coverage for what turned out to be a dullish document, only hinting at the main arguments already made both publicly and privately by the provincial critics. Its chief moan is that the political accords at Maastricht fell far behind the monetary ones. But, as one of Mr Kohl's aides says, ""the chancellor does not need the Bundesbank to tell him that.""
The end of the affair? Hardly. Once the Bundesbankers would have rallied round their leader after a joint statement had been agreed, whatever their personal views. Now it looks more likely that the Maastricht critics will keep up their sniping regardless. That may not bother Mr Kohl, who is still determined to see the accords ratified on schedule this year. But it may further undermine Mr Schlesinger's authority and, by implication, that of the Bundesbank itself. Remembering that the Bundesbank's ability to talk German wage-settlements and inflation down depends on its credibility in financial markets and beyond, that is no small matter."

At one time, it was popular to blame pollution, but scientists have not been able to show a clear association between dirt and the disease.
Whatever the cause, there is a sinister suspicion that, in some circumstances, some treatments may be exacerbating it. A study of beta-agonists--drugs used to relieve the symptoms of asthma--was published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. It tracked more than 12,000 asthma sufferers in Saskatchewan, Canada between 1980 and 1987. Beta-agonists, which serve to relax smooth-muscle fibres, are administered by inhaler. A typical sufferer uses between one and two inhalers a month. The study suggested that the (small) risk of dying from asthma increased 2-1/2-fold for every additional beta-agonist inhaler used per month. This result prompted Boehringer Ingelheim, the German firm that sponsored the study and manufactures fenoterol, one of the beta-agonists examined, to release some of the Saskatchewan data last October so that they could be discussed at a meeting of the European Respiratory Society. The results caused much alarm and medical debate.
Asthma is a common disease in which the airways lining the lung become inflamed. As a result the airways are ""twitchy""; they contract in response to all sorts of stimuli, from cats to milk. That leads to difficulties in breathing, and to other problems. An attack can occur minutes after exposure to a stimulus, and last for several days. Beta-agonists relieve symptoms during and after attacks by relaxing the muscles and thus making the airways dilate. If attacks persist, or occur frequently, the beta-agonists may be taken as a regular treatment, rather than just when needed. It is regular use that is causing most concern.
Questions over the safety of beta-agonists have cropped up sporadically since the drugs became available in the 1960S. There is a lot at stake, not only for the patients, but also for the drug companies. As well as Boehringer Ingelheim, other manufacturers include Britain's Glaxo and Sweden's Astra, whose combined yearly sales of salbutamol and terbutaline, the top-selling beta-agonists, approach $1 billion.
In the 1960s an asthma epidemic swept parts of the world. It was the worst ever recorded; in Britain deaths due to asthma doubled to 2,000 a year, making it a major cause of death among under-35s. Isoprenaline, a beta-agonist, had been launched shortly before the onset of the epidemic, so it was naturally cross-examined in the medical dock. Many now think that doctors were more to blame than drugs--they thought that the new drugs would be sufficient in themselves, so severe problems went undiagnosed and patients who should have been hospitalised were not. After the alarm bells rang, the epidemic subsided. Hospital admissions went up, suggesting that patients were now getting treatment in time. Asthma deaths more than halved in the early 1970s, and sales of isoprenaline also fell. Some doubts lingered.
In the late 1970s a second epidemic of asthma deaths began in New Zealand. This time, the case against a particular drug--fenoterol--seemed stronger. Two studies published last year may prove to be definitive. One showed that in New Zealand fenoterol was sold in much higher doses than other beta-agonists. The other, a study by Malcolm Sears and his colleagues at the University of Otago Medical School in Dunedin, looked at the fortunes of 64 patients either given fenoterol on a regular basis, or just when attacks occurred, or received a placebo. During the 24 weeks of the trial all received all forms of treatment at one time or another. While on regular fenoterol people suffered worse asthma than they did when they were taking the drug less frequently.
Dr Sears's data suggested that steady use was to blame. It is accepted that patients adapt to drugs. It may be that if, after adapting, they cease treatment for some reason, the adaptation makes them unusually sensitive to whatever triggers their asthma--something known as a rebound effect. Alternatively, a beta-agonist might be too potent for its own good, relieving symptoms while the underlying conditions of the disease become worse, but stay unnoticed. Whatever the explanation, it was unlikely that fenoterol alone had problems. Other beta-agonists might well suffer from the same untoward effects. The Canadian study just published seems to bear this out, though it looks at deaths, not sickness. It is the first to study all beta-agonists, including salbutamol and terbutaline.
Yet after reviewing all the information before them, America's Food and Drug Administration, last December, and Britain's Committee on Safety of Medicines, on February 18th, came to the conclusion that there was not enough evidence to condemn beta-agonists--at least not enough to require a change in doctors' prescribing habits. One piece of evidence stressed by the CSM is that, although the number of prescriptions for inhaled beta-agonists trebled in the 1980s, the incidence of deaths due to asthma in Britain is still about the same as it was a decade ago. That hardly makes them seem dangerous. Though there is not much hard data, the sufferers' quality of life seems clearly improved by the drugs.
Dr Sears's study was fairly small and has yet to be repeated, and the effects of other anti-asthma drugs the patients were taking are hard to isolate among the data. As for the Saskatchewan study, even the authors point out that their finding only demonstrates a correlation between beta-agonist dosage and the severity of asthma. Among the 12,000-plus asthma cases investigated, 44 died and 85 nearly did so. These unfortunates were defined as the ""cases"". Then 655 other asthmatics in the study were chosen as controls; in their ages, the places where they lived, their wealth and other factors they matched the 129 cases. The drug dosages of the cases and the controls were then compared; the cases took more beta-agonists than the controls.
The comparisons were then put through more statistical hoops, in order to take into account the fact that people with worse asthma are likely to take more drugs. There was still a difference between the cases and the controls--but the fact that the unwell take more drugs cannot be eliminated entirely.
A few weeks ago companies and scientific experts met in Florida to discuss their next steps. Last year Glaxo and Ciba-Geigy launched longer-acting versions of their beta-agonists, which they hope will prove to be big sellers. Glaxo says its studies (yet to be published) with beta-agonists show that control of asthma improves rather than degenerates with long-term use of the drug. But the drug's effects normally last only six hours or less. The new longer-acting drugs promise to protect asthma patients for up to 12 hours, so that they can sleep better at night. As long as there are worries about beta-agonists, though, that sleep may not be easy."

However, links with the continent could bring about other, less frightening but still threatening problems for livestock of all sorts--as the island's 30,000 beekeepers are now discovering.
Varroa jacobsoni is a mite that is little bigger than this full stop. It sucks the bodily fluids of bees. In India--its original home--bees groom each other fastidiously to get rid of it, and it seems harmless. In the last few decades, though, Varroa has come to Europe, and here--perhaps because of a lack of grooming--it is lethal. European honeybee colonies collapse about three years after they become infected with Varroa.
Exactly why the hives die is a mystery worthy of that noted apiarist, Sherlock Holmes. Some suggest that the mite has a viral accomplice. But the same viruses are present in hives without Varroa, and seem never to do any harm. Brenda Ball, a bee pathologist at the Agriculture and Food Research Council's experimental station in Rothamsted, says that the mite may make the virus multiply, and thus kill the bees.
This story does not convince Don Griffiths, a former chief acarolist (a mite-watchman) for the Ministry of Agriculture. He notes that in a strong hive--the type worst hit--the mites can breed quickly on the plentiful larvae, and then attack the workers en masse. Robert Paxton, a bee researcher at the University of Wales in Cardiff, has a slightly different explanation. Worker bees do different jobs as they age. They work as cleaners first, then as nurses to growing larvae, next as construction workers, and finally as foragers seeking nectar and pollen. Varroa-infested bees simply laze around the hive and then fly off. That would explain why dead colonies often contain few dead workers.
In continental Europe, beekeepers are more interested in stopping Varroa than understanding its modus operandi. They dose every hive with pesticides at least once every two years to keep the colony alive. In Greece and Turkey the chemicals are only slightly more toxic to the mites than to the bees. More selective compounds like those used in Germany are kinder, but could still be accumulating in the wax and honey. That possibility has not been investigated, according to Ingrid Williams, another entomologist at Rothamsted. In any case, none of these chemicals is currently permitted in Britain.
So far, quarantine laws and the Channel have kept Varroa out of Britain. But the European single market defines quarantine laws as a barrier to trade. European beekeepers would welcome the opportunity to hire out their hives to pollinate orchards in Britain. As drafted, the single-market legislation would allow even infested bees free access.
It may be amended. David Curry, a junior agriculture minister, described the original EC proposals as ""far from satisfactory"" and wants new safeguards. And bees are not the only ones at risk. According to the British ministry, regulations that currently keep at bay such diseases as avian influenza and even rabies could, technically, be seen as restraints on competition. Negotiators are trying to keep the barriers up, but a spokeswoman for the ministry was not optimistic. ""The attitude in Brussels seems to be 'We have to live with it, and so should you'."" However that does not seem to apply to British exports of mad cow disease."

Some Americans still say they do not want a car assembled on a Friday or a Monday, fearing--without hard evidence--that anticipation of the weekend and recovery from it make workers more slipshod. Something similar may be happening at sea. Oil tankers, it appears, suffer a quarter of their major spills on Saturdays--well over the seventh one might expect, Nearly all the ""extra"" spills are due to human error.
This insight was unearthed serendipitously by an environmental economist, Eban Goodstein of Skidmore College in Saratoga Spring, New York. He wanted to find out how the stockmarket punishes sloppy oil companies. However, he found that spills were clumped together on Saturdays, when the markets are not open to mete out such punishment. Turning a setback into an opportunity, he switched projects.
Just how and why do tankers go wrong at the weekend? Mr Goodstein describes how; the exact why is still a mystery. Data from the Oil Spill Intelligence Report and the OECD make it clear that most of the extra Saturday spills can be put down to steering accidents: ships collide, ram something, or run aground. Because such accidents tend to happen in or near harbours, where more obstacles lurk to ram or collide with, the extra 163,000 gallons spilled in a year of Saturdays can make a nasty mess.
Why Saturdays? Ships are no more likely to enter or leave harbours on Saturdays than on other days. There are more recreational boats sailing and putt-putting about, but tankers seem as likely to be distracted by them as whales by minnows. Sunday, moreover, which probably sees as much recreational seamanship, is as quiet and clean as any other day of the week; it gets 9% of tanker traffic and 11% of spills.
One clue to the Saturday surplus is that the extra mishaps are not distributed evenly around the world. They happen in North America, Europe, and countries whose population is mainly Christian. Some murky aspect of the psychology of the weekend seems responsible. Why Sunday is spared might best be researched by sociologists or anthropologists tailing crew members on shore leave.
Whatever the cause is, it would be a good effect to stop. Some of the 1.8m gallons of oil spilled each year because of ramming, collisions and similar mistakes is clearly the inevitable price of moving the stuff around. The Saturday effect, though, should be remediable. Insurers could, in principle, force tanker crews to change their ways by imposing a penalty for a Saturday spill. Whether they will or not is unclear; they still charge the same premiums for single-hulled and double-hulled vessels.
If the industry will not act, government could. Goodstein calculates that a tax on Saturday tanker movements into or out of harbours of $780 for a 20m gallon cargo would shift the right amount of traffic to other days of the week. At that level of tax, the cost of preventing an additional gallon of spilled oil equals the additional environmental benefit from not spilling the last gallon. Harbour authorities can spend the revenue as they please, be it on prettification, bird sanctuaries, or contests of dexterity to lure sailors away from the bottle."

On February 10th President Bush asked Admiral Richard Truly, who runs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), for his resignation. He got what he wanted; the resignation was announced two days later. But while the White House was saying what a fine public servant the admiral had been, he was telling reporters that he had been fired.
An embarrassing end to a job that, by some lights, Mr Truly performed quite well. When President Bush chose him for the top job at NASA in 1989, he had just nursed the space-shuttle programme out of its post-Challenger malaise and back into orbit. As administrator, he saw to it that the shuttle got about as close to routine operation as it is ever likely to get. He also presided over a real increase of 25% in NASA'S budget, from $10.4 billion in 1989 to $14.3 billion this year, and spent much of that money on the grand space station the agency has been designing since the mid-1980s.
This growth, though, is not a tribute to Mr Truly's salesmanship. He is not a particularly charismatic or expansive man, nor is he overburdened with vision. He has reaped the benefits of running NASA at a time when the president, the vice-president and the director of the budget are all keen on spaceflight. Such benefits carry a cost: true believers, in space as on earth, are apt to try to shake things up. Mr Truly is a spaceflight enthusiast, too. He has experienced its realities as a shuttle astronaut. However, like many others in NASA, he sees little if any difference between a commitment to space travel and a commitment to NASA's space shuttle and space station. In the eyes of other believers, most notably those of the National Space Council, a policy body run by Dan Quayle, things look less straightforward. To the space council, NASA is a tool with which to execute the president's policy--a sometimes clumsy tool.
The space council saw a clear distinction between the bureaucracy's interests and the national interest, and felt that Mr Truly did not. Its main complaint was that whenever NASA was asked to do something--like prepare plans for a retum to the moon and a trip to Mars--it would come back with a set of projects it already had going or in a file, rather than with fresh ideas. The council tried various ways of chivvying NASA, the most public of which was a commission to ponder the agency's future. This reported a little over a year ago.
The situation got worse, and more personal, when Mr Truly's deputy, J.R. Thompson, resigned last year because of family problems. Mr Truly wanted to appoint a replacement from within NASA. The space council wanted an outsider who might see things differently. There was no shortage of names, but none of them was willing to take the number two job. So thoughts turned to removing the admiral. According to council sources, last December Mr Quayle suggested other jobs that Mr Truly might take, but the admiral appeared not to respond. From then on, apparently, it was only a matter of time until his resignation was demanded.
The manner of Mr Truly's going has made the differences between the administration and NASA quite public. Now the gap will have to be closed--and the movement will likely come from NASA. The new administrator and his or her new deputy may shake NASA up quite thoroughly. As Mr Thompson pointed out in a report just before he retired--a report that Mr Truly appeared to be about to act on--NASA'S research centres duplicate each other's work. Some should be reorganised, merged or closed. New procurement practices are under discussion, though despite reports to the contrary they seem not to have played a crucial part in Mr Truly's departure. There is always the possibility of staff cuts--made easier by the fact that a lot of NASA management is nearing retirement. Some senior staff may leave in Mr Truly's wake, anyway.
Perhaps the most intriguing of the mooted new brooms is James Abrahamson, who ran the shuttle programme in the early 1980s. As the first head of the Strategic Defence Initiative Organisation, General Abrahamson proved himself good at selling ideas. The SDIO has a reputation for coming up with clever, even whacky, notions in abundance, though as yet it has no record of turning them into full scale programmes. A former SDIO man, Michael Griffin, recently took over NASA'S tiny manned-exploration office, and is making gratifyingly innovative noises. General Abrahamson is now with Hughes, an aerospace company, where he might have hoped to succeed the current chief executive, Malcolm Currie. That now appears unlikely, so he might take the NASA job if offered it. That offer might not come, though; some say he would have a hard time getting confirmed by the Senate.
There are doubtless many other people on the list--but whether they would want the job is another question. Aerospace industry leaders lose a lot of money by choosing public service; why should they do so for an unpleasant job? NASA'S budget is unlikely to grow much, so to get exciting new things done the new chief will have to cut others. At present, the administration supports the space station and the shuttle; their budgets may be hard to trim. So the new head might well end up unable to do much more than Mr Truly did, while making himself unpopular by cutting many smaller programmes. The smart thing for a candidate to do would be to take the job provided he be allowed to rethink the space station from scratch, an offer the administration would be wise to accept. Whether such wisdom will prevail is anyone's guess."

Faber and Faber; 208 pages; L17.99. SPANISH JOURNEYS: A PORTRAIT OF SPAIN. By Adam Hopkins. Viking; 396 pages; L16.99. CITIES OF SPAIN: By David Gilmour. Published next month by John Murray; 214 pages; L17.95.
""You can be fooled very easily by surfaces in Spain, all is so rich in appearance, so intensely dramatic,"" writes Adam Hopkins. The urge to understand Spain's passionate complexities has pulled forth fine writing from foreigners as diverse as George Borrow, George Orwell and Gerald Brenan. The crossroads of Moor, Jew and Christian; the cradle of conquistadores; the battleground of enlightenment and reaction; fascism's last western stronghold: vivid Spain has often seemed the world in microcosm, exerting a fascination beyond its strictly Iberian due.
Democratic, fairly prosperous, nestling in the bosom of the European Community, does Spain now have a world role to play that is significantly different from, say, Denmark's? Is its own rich mixture of social, religious and regional peculiarities headed for pasteurised extinction? Some answers should come from the vast quantity of books on Spain this year, as the country commemorates the 500th anniversary of its ""discovery"" of America, hosts the Olympic Games and holds a world's fair.
One early entrant in Spanish-book year, by Ian Gibson, starts from the premise that Spain may now rediscover its true civilising mission: to foster understanding among the three cultures that coexisted fruitfully there in medieval times. That was before a new militancy replaced tolerance, and the Christians kicked out those Jews and Moors whom they had not already killed.
He sees grounds for hope in Spain's new liberalism, but fears official failure to debunk the Francoist myths of an heroic Reconquista, to set up cross-cultural studies in schools and universities, to resolve Spain's contested mastery of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa, and to put the desires of its Muslim neighbours ahead of those of its nervous allies in northern Europe and the United States. Other obstacles include a growing backlash in Spain against North African immigrants, and the fact that Spain competes economically with, for example, Morocco.
The idea that Spain is especially well placed to be a bridge between Islam and anything else, though dear to many Spaniards, is a fairly fanciful one, and Mr Gibson wisely does not linger. Nor does he have much time for Hispanidad--the ties that bind the Spanish-speaking world--which he correctly calls ""little more than an alloy of sentimentalism and rhetoric"".
Of greater moment, he says, is Spain's future in Europe. It is thus unfortunate that his canter through Spanish history leaps vertiginously from the launching of the Armada in 1588 to the loss of Cuba in 1898, as Spanish attitudes to Europe are grounded in the three progressively-less-glorious centuries that he omits. So too are the patterns of political strife, corruption and alienation against which Spain's present relative harmony looks the more miraculous.
Intended to complement an undemanding BBC series on Spain, Mr Gibson's book usefully draws attention to the threat that unregulated development has posed to Europe's biggest concentration of natural riches. It also conveys a sense of what it is to be Spanish today: the new freedoms, the old resentments, the growing materialism, noise, traffic. Otherwise, it says little that is challenging or new. Political judgments are timid. The people it hates are so very safe to hate (Franco, Torquemada); the kin is wall-to-wall wonderful; Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, is at worst ""pragmatic"". It seems hastily written: public figures are much-respected (by whom?), demonstrations deeply moving, Basques proud and hard-working. The author of two good books on the poet Federico Garcia Lorca, Mr Gibson knows much more about Spain than this.
Adam Hopkins's more interesting book may reach fewer people, without the BBC wind to help it. A journalist and travel writer with a keen sense of history, art, architecture and the telling human detail, he sweeps around Spain in a style that will be familiar to fans of H.V. Morton's 1955 masterpiece, ""A Stranger in Spain"". Advancing no global political theories, he manages nonetheless to ponder the cost of Castilian centralisation, or the roots of Catalan anarchism, between appreciations of Velazquez and Barcelona's modernista architects.
In similarly unpretentious vein, David Gilmour sets out to describe nine of Spain's most important cities, and ends by saying quite a lot about Spain through the ages. An earlier book by Mr Gilmour, ""The Transformation of Spain"", was the best of the easily accessible accounts of Spain's recent transition to democracy. He shows in his latest offering a breadth of historical perspective and familiarity with others' writing on Spain through the ages that will open generous doors to those who wish to deepen their knowledge.
He, like Mr Hopkins, has got beneath most of the surfaces that both evoke vividly and often beautifully. If Mr Gibson delivers rather less than he promises, Mr Hopkins and Mr Gilmour deliver rather more."

Say this for Michael Crichton: the man has timing. His latest novel--a murder mystery in which a ruthless corporate Japan and a spineless America are the villains--reached American bookshops just as some Japanese politicians said some silly thing about the United States. A country outraged at being told that its workers are lazy, illiterate and can't make anything on Mondays and Fridays is fertile ground for a Japan-bashing thriller full of bromide about how America is going to hell in a handbasket.
The book has already hit the best-seller lists and is soon to be made into a film. Its message has prompted one reviewer, in the New York Times, to liken its potential impact to that of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". It is surely only a matter of time before one of the more protectionist presidential candidates begins recommending it to voters.
Why the fuss? As a thriller, ""Rising Sun"" is an entertaining enough read. It begins with the murder of a beautiful woman of questionable morals on a conference table in Nakamoto Tower in Los Angeles. Local and national glitterati dazzle themselves on a floor below. Two detectives from the city's Special Services Division--which specialises in smoothing ruffled Japanese fathers--are called to the scene.
The two solve the crime, but only after following a trail involving cover-ups, bribery, blackmail, suicide and attempted murder, all perpetrated in a vast conspiracy to let a large Japanese company keep face and grab yet another chunk of the American high-technology market. The reader gets a crash course on Japanese culture, business ethics (or lack of them) and a raft of factual titbits about how America lost the VCR market and so on.
Yet this is no potboiler, aimed simply at cashing in on America's paranoia of the month. The author is a true believer in America's decline at the hands of Japan. And if page after page of anti-Japanese invective, references to unbridled Japanese control over American institutions and scorn about America's response are not enough to prove it, Mr Crichton provides a bibliography of articles and books on the subject and an afterword in which he calls on America to heed the warning.
Americans must come to grips with the fact that Japan has become the leading industrial nation in the world, he says (wrongly), and with the realisation that America is blind to the business-as-war, adversarial-trade philosophy used against it. He rightly says that it is absurd to blame Japan for its success, but the tale he tells makes that proposition ring somewhat hollow.
Mr Crichton cudgels the reader about a Japanese takeover, on more than one occasion becoming outright absurd. Japan may indeed make most of the television sets in America, but even the most passionate American protectionist would not argue that there is a single sleazy bar in the United States that does not serve Budweiser, only Asahi. Nor could anyone who has seen American television accept that an evening-news crew would ignore a murder at a party at which Madonna was a guest because reporting it would be unfair to the Japanese owner of the building.
Moreover, Mr Crichton undermines what he wants to say with a drumbeat of generalities about Japanese behaviour. The book is full of stereotypes, most of them unflattering. If it had been written about Jewish businessmen, it would never have seen the light of day. (Mr Crichton tries to cover himself by having a character say that any criticism of Japan is always deemed racist.)
He does have useful thing to say (notably about American short-termism and management greed), and he says it in a presentable format. But he hugely over-does it. His conclusion, that America should learn to act more like Japan, putting up barriers, favouring home-grown firms and practising other retaliatory nonsenses, will regrettably bring some meaningful nods from many American readers and from politicians who know a popular issue when they see one. Pity free trade isn't as good for fiction as protectionism."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136207/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/63?accountid=14657,"People curious to get some idea of what it is like to be black in a country run by whites need look no further than ""Crossover"". It helps that Dennis Williams is apparently not attempting the thing called a political statement. In some ways it hardly matters that his main character, Richard (Ike) Isaac, is black.
Like other sensitive, well-meaning American students in the late 1960s and early 1970s, young Isaac is often bewildered and hurt as he struggles to keep his balance at an Ivy League college rocked by the movements for civil rights and against the war in Vietnam. It helps that Isaac and the man he looks up to, an elderly uncle-figure in his hometown, have a great sense of fun. Both at times provoke loud laughter.
In other ways, Isaac's colour matters a lot. His forceful mother disapproves of his girlfriend just because she is white. So do ""the brothers"" on campus--the freshmen in their denim caps and sneakers as much as the upper-classmen with dashikis, braids and large lumps of jewellery. When a white youngster is shot at a demonstration led by black radicals, Isaac's skin is suddenly noticed by his previously colour-blind college room-mate, Art Rosen. ""I'm just tryin to go to school, you know"", says Rosen angrily, ""tryin to be a regular guy...Why can't you stop it, man? Why can't somebody stop all this bullshit?""
Isaac sees everyday things differently from his white contemporaries. He is intrigued by a bus depot tarted up to resemble an old railway station. Pew-like benches line walls decorated in elaborate tiles beneath a stamped tin ceiling that is holding a large, lazy fan. The ticket counter is an old-fashioned bank-teller's window. Perhaps, Isaac thinks, this quaintness is typical of those places where white people, and not just poor ones, still ride the bus.
The bus depot is in stark contrast to the inner-city area were Isaac grew up. It is old and crumbly now, like Depression pictures of southern poverty. ""The stores didn't have real signs and the homes left standing had no people or too many.""
Isaac's eye is as acute at a graduation ceremony at college. He notices that people who wear suits and ties all week look ordinary on special occasions. It is the others, including the relative handful of black parents, who look as if they are going somewhere. Isaac describes it as the janitor-as-deacon phenomenon: black people doing menial jobs all week but able to shine at church on Sunday.
""Crossover"" is at times a hard read. This is Mr Williams's first novel and he is not yet a fluent writer. He battles to find the right words. But what he has to say is sincere and original."
22-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224170300/fulltext/966F49E0EC774A94PQ/64?accountid=14657,"It is roughly ten years since AIDS caught the world's attention. That is not a long time in the span of the arts; but the suffering AIDS has caused makes it an issue many artists feel they must not shirk. When Spike Lee omitted any reference to the epidemic in a film script set in today's Brooklyn, he was taken to task for escapism. The director's retort, perhaps well-founded, was that to bring in such a subject would have ruined the balance of his film. If any conclusion can be drawn from the mass of novels, poems, films and other works that now refer to AIDS, it is about this risk of imbalance.
Some of the first and best works on the subject came from French writers, whose Cartesian prose avoided hysteria. In those days, the early 1980s, the afflicted had a brief lease on life indeed; some barely had time for a tentative account of what had hit them. Historical comparisons are risky, yet one writer stricken with AIDS, a young French sociologist, Alain-Emanuel Dreuilhe, in his ""Body to Body: A Journal of AIDS"" (Gallimard, 1987), described his work as a ""war diary"" and his struggle as a ""third world war"". To this day, readers of the New York Times obituary columns, scanning the daily casualty-list of AIDS, can see how Dreuilhe came upon his metaphor.
The American stage offered a more aggressive approach. Larry Kramer wrote an outspoken play about AIDS, ""The Normal Heart"", when the illness was otherwise hardly being talked about. Another Broadway drama, William Hoffmann's prizewinning ""As Is"", was less strident. Yet, for most American plays on the subject, stridency appeared to be almost a duty.
This was not the case in poetry. There, given the devastating nature of the illness, it seemed understandable that more and more works should be created not by those directly hit, but by mourning bystanders. James Merrill offered some gentle elegies for friends who had disappeared in their prime. In his collection ""The Inner Room"" (Knopf, 1988), Mr Merrill avoided uncontrolled wailings in the poems he dedicated to a friend, David Kalstone, whose ashes he had scattered from a rowing-boat into Long Island Sound:
You are gone. You'd caught like a cold their airy lust for essence. Now, in the furnace parched to ten or twelve light handfuls, a mortal gravel sifted through fingers, coarse yet grayly glimmering sublimate of palace days...
Another welcome exception to the American tendency to shrillness is Armistead Maupin, particularly his latest novel, ""Sure of You"" (Corgi Books, 1991). Although Mr Maupin has lost several friends to AIDS, he has managed to create a light and airy book. ""Sure of You"" has characters who would not be out of place in a pleasant film comedy. Yet the author finds room to express some home truths about the epidemic. Mr Maupin seems to have integrated AIDS into his creative work better than some more ""serious"" writers.
Elsewhere, other difficulties have shown themselves. Derek Jarman, a British film director who was one of the first artists to admit in public that he was HIV-positive, has done some admirable work to make people aware of the disaster. Yet, for many Britons, it seems too direct, too American to address the subject in a work of art. When two artists, Gilbert and George, generously offered all receipts from a London gallery show last May to a charity, CRUSAID, they admitted that the works on show were ""not specifically related to AIDS."" Elton John's large donation of song royalties to another AIDS charity, the Terrence Higgins Trust, is based on songs that promote sympathy for the afflicted in general.
It is France that seems to be leading the way. A French novelist called Herve Guibert attracted nationwide attention when he disclosed on television that he had AIDS. His work, which had previously dealt rather ponderously with themes like blindness, sadomasochism and hatred of parents, then centred on himself and his illness. ""To the Friend Who Did Not Save My Life"" (Gallimard Publishers, 1990; English translation from Quarto Books, London) describes the sadomasochistic tastes of Guibert's friend, an historian called Michel Foucault, one of the first French intellectuals to be a victim of AIDS. Guibert suggested that his own illness, by becoming the focus of his creative life was a sort of gift.
One of his posthumous works has just appeared in France from Les Editions du Seuil. ""Cytomegalovirus"" (named after a medical problem that affected his sight) is an astonishingly acute and even humorous account of a stay in a typically inhuman French hospital. When a nurse offered him a skimpy see-through plastic blue gown to wear, Guibert told her: ""The only way you'll get me to cross the hospital in that get-up is if you wear one too, and we'll go hand in hand."" A more sombre documentary of Guibert's last year is soon to be shown on French television, under the title ""Modesty and Immodesty"".
Maybe, at the moment, the most useful thing artists can say is that grief for AIDS should be a part of a wider grief for all suffering. It is possible that the finest work of fiction for understanding AIDS was written a century before the epidemic: Tolstoy's ""Death of Ivan Ilych"". That account of compassion for another's fatal pain has not been surpassed, because there has been no greater novelist than Tolstoy. The comfort that Tolstoy's suffering Ivan Ilych feels when his feet are held by his good-natured servant Gerasim seems entirely pertinent to what Elton John and others are saying today.
With less than perfect support from politicians and churches, the arts have assumed part of the burden of consolation. Victims like Guibert and Dreuilhe, sympathetic onlookers like James Merrill and Armistead Maupin, pop artists like Elton John, all show that art can take the responsibility. Guibert gave the writer's ideal response: ""It is when I am writing that I am most alive, words are beautiful, words are right, words are victorious."" Even Tolstoy might not have put it better."

The disease is often linked to homosexuality, so physical affliction has been compounded by a particular mental anguish. It seems inevitable for plays about AIDS to become polemics, attacking critics of homosexuality and veering into a defiant sentimentality.
All of which is cause to welcome ""Angels in America"", by Tony Kushner. His is a two-part play, the first part of which, ""Millennium Approaches"", had its British premiere last month at the National Theatre. The play itself, with its mixture of individual cases and national issues, the cosmic and the contemporary, gravitas and the light touch, is as bold as was its genesis. Mr Kushner told the San Francisco theatre company which commissioned the play that he wanted to write about AIDS, Mormons and Senator Joseph McCarthy's notorious assistant, Roy Cohn. At the time he had no idea what those ill-assorted elements had in common. In writing ""Angels in America"" he produced the links, with a fine freshness.
The play explores AIDS through a homosexual couple whose relationship is put under pressure when one of them contracts the disease. The physical effect of the illness is unflinchingly presented. The crisis comes with the reaction of the unaffected partner, who cannot cope with his lover's condition. His glib, politicised view of the world masks an inability to respond to individual need, to acknowledge what a homosexual friend calls ""the hard law of love"".
Equally under pressure is the marriage of a young Mormon couple. The wife is an agoraphobic who talks to herself, swallows Valium and hears men with knives in the next room. Her husband's determination to carry on in the cheery, forthright manner expected of Mormons is increasingly undermined by his awareness of his repressed homosexuality. He is a protege of a sinister, manic power-broker, Roy Cohn, also a homosexual, who has plans for him as part of Cohn's covert Washington operations.
The play cuts back and forth between these characters; sometimes it presents them in simultaneous scenes. Their various predicaments, it becomes clear, are emotionally linked. Other people have depicted AIDS as a gay plague, a punishment for unnatural conduct. In ""Angels in America"" it takes on deeper implications, rather like Albert Camus's "" La Peste""; it becomes a test of how the basic facts of life are confronted.
Mr Kushner is not afraid to pursue the facts of life beyond the limits of realism: not for nothing is the play called ""Angels in America"". After the AIDS victim has been abandoned by his lover, he begins to hear a heavenly voice telling him to ""prepare the way"". The Mormon wife's hallucinations expand to include an imaginary travel agent, who blithely volunteers to whisk her away from irksome reality to any destination she wishes, and forthwith translates her to a surreal Antarctica. And at the play's climax an angel does appear, clothed in shining white and suspended improbably from above, to announce that ""the messenger has arrived"".
For Mr Kushner, these intrusions of the magical and the mystical are part of the consciousness of his characters and of the possibilities of the world, just as much as politics is. AIDS, he has said, ""reminds us that compassion has to do with passion"", and that people's lives are not circumscribed by logic and laws, accusation and polemic. Beneath the play lies his conviction that ""progressive ideologies maintain their divorce from the ineffable, the mysterious, the spiritual"", and that ""this is a blindness we can no loner afford."" ""Angels in America"", ingenious, tender and high-spirited, exuberantly shows that the terrors of AIDS are part of a web of experience everybody shares."

Both had distinctive styles. Mr Gunn, although a somewhat cerebral writer with a fondness for traditional forms, was a celebrator of the pop heroes of those times: James Dean, Elvis Presley and the bikers whose brash, virile posturing seemed to be a celebration of toughness for its own sake. Mr Hughes, on the other hand, was already writing the poems by which his reputation will stand or fall, formless creations with a rough physical energy, written ostensibly in homage to birds and animals, so admirably indifferent to the murderous consequences of their actions.
Their ways soon diverged. Mr Hughes stayed in England, digging ever deeper into the same kind of material, around which he later began to weave webs of private mythology. Mr Gunn went off to America's West Coast, to study under Yvor Winters, a poet and critic. He made San Francisco his home, and has stayed there, learning over the years to write in a freer, looser, franker manner--and to be more open about his homosexuality, a subject impossible to write about in England in the 1950s.
It is ten years since his previous book of poems, ""Passages of Joy"", was published. That deals with homosexuality happily: indeed, one might almost say uncomplicatedly, if that word were possible in so terribly tangled a subject. His new book*, on the other hand, published this month, is overshadowed by the AIDS crisis, which has devastated the homosexuals in San Francisco.
The earlier sections of the book still deal with the pleasures of the hedonistic body--those marvels of self-display that can be glimpsed on street corners and beaches and in the launderettes--much as his earlier works had done. But the concluding section, the most important one, consists of a sequence of elegies to his dead friends, men whom he names in the notes at the back because, as he tells us, ""they were not famous"".
The longest of these poems (the longest Mr Gunn has ever written) is called ""Lament"", and relates all the small, harrowing incidents in those final hours before death comes to numb the pain of a body that has survived too long. The account is terrible. Other, much shorter, poems are equally affecting: ""Still Life"", for example, in which the stillness is not that of inanimate objects but of a dying face locked into immobility.
In the past, Mr Gunn's poetry has often seemed to lack warmth; his intellect has been in control. Now the close witnessing of that ""difficult, tedious, painful enterprise of dying"" has given his poetry more life and more raw human vigour than it has ever had before.

The parallels between F.W. de Klerk and those two great reformers-who-came-unstuck seem horribly close. All those who want a peaceful and democratic future for South Africa must hope that appearances deceive, and that Mr de Klerk will turn out to be neither.
It was the collapse of communism in 1989 that persuaded Mr de Klerk to send his country hurtling down the road to reform. Almost overnight, it seems, the African National Congress ceased in his mind to be a terrorist organisation controlled by the Kremlin; equally suddenly, democracy came to be seen by him as an unstoppable idea. The erstwhile right-winger of one of the world's most right-wing parties became the man who is now doing his best to turn the land of apartheid into a non-racial democracy.
But, while the world applauds, his own people, the whites--like Mikhail Gorbachev's Communists when his reforms gathered pace--are apprehensive; some are aghast. After his party's loss of the Potchefstroom by-election on February 19th, it seems possible that Mr de Klerk, like Mr Gorbachev, will lose control of the beast he has unleashed, plunging South Africa into chaos. In an effort to see off his opponents and regain control, he has now called a referendum--which conjures up memories of Charles de Gaulle. It was de Gaulle's attempt to reassert his leadership in 1969 by holding a yes-or-no vote on his constitutional reforms that led to the blowing of a big framboise and his consequent resignation. If South Africa's whites follow the example of France's voters in 1969, Mr de Klerk has said he too will resign.
That would be bad news for South Africa. It is possible that Mr de Klerk would come back and lead his party to victory in the ensuing general election. It is possible that he would be replaced by another reformer. That no reforming successor is obvious does not mean none exists: when he took over the National Party leadership in 1989, nobody expected Mr de Klerk to turn out the way he has done. Still, the likelihood is that, if Mr de Klerk loses the referendum, white politics in South Africa will fall into the hands of mediocrities trying to turn back the clock, while black politics will become much rougher. More blood will flow.
South Africa has problems in abundance, but in its two most prominent politicians it is fortunate. Nelson Mandela's 27 years in prison have helped make him the undisputed leader of the African National Congress without at the same time embittering him; under his leadership, the ANC-which is easily the most popular organisation among blacks-will be a tough but not an intransigent negotiator. Mr de Klerk has already shown his political courage; the unanswered question concerns his political skill.
The chances are that this will not be found wanting. For, by calling a referendum, and calling it soon, Mr de Klerk is doing the very thing Mr Gorbachev could never bring himself to do: submit his actions to the vote. Admittedly, an all-white referendum in which 86% of the adult population will not cast a ballot will hardly confer full democratic legitimacy on Mr de Klerk. But, as he points out, that is to miss the point. Nobody doubts that the bulk of the non-white majority supports his reforms. Opinion polls have suggested that more than 80% of urban blacks are satisfied with Mr de Klerk's leadership; some have even shown him to be more popular among blacks than Mr Mandela, by a margin of up to 20%.
But will Mr de Klerk have his come-uppance from the white right and thus suffer the fate of de Gaulle? This is certainly the risk. Many whites--and not just Afrikaners--are frightened. Violence is rife. Some 2,600 people died in political disputes last year, and about half as many again were murdered by ordinary criminals. Meanwhile the economy, after contracting for two years, is set to grow only slowly. The course on which Mr de Klerk has set the country will lead to the ending of many white privileges, to fewer subsidies for whites, and probably to a fall in their living standards (see pages 21-24). No wonder they are nervous.
They will be nervous, however, whatever course they take. One merit of Mr de Klerk's decision to hold the referendum early is that it obliges his white opponents, notably the Conservative Party led by Andries Treurnicht, to explain the alternative to reform. At present they are split (see page 45). They have said they want self-determination for whites, meaning an Afrikaner homeland. But even extreme Conservatives admit that there can be no going back to grand apartheid, and that there will have to be negotiations with the black majority.
DE KLERK AND CRICKET? OR DR NO AND SOLITAIRE?
The choice therefore becomes one of negotiations carried out by Mr de Klerk or negotiations carried out by Dr Treurnicht. One is an adroit politician who can manifestly do business with the black majority and thus bring South Africa back into the world, ensuring an end to sanctions and the return of foreign diplomats, entertainers and sportsmen. The other is a wooden reactionary--he was known as Dr No even before his decision this week to campaign for a ""no"" vote in the referendum--who can offer only constitutional fantasies, the certainty of greater violence and the continuation of South Africa's painful isolation.
It is the starkness of this choice that will, with luck, save Mr de Klerk from the fate of de Gaulle. De Gaulle was rejected because the French reckoned he had delighted them long enough (Dix ans, ca suffit), and they thought they could manage without him. Only the wilfully obtuse could believe the same of Mr de Klerk. The wilfully obtuse are not an extinct breed in South Africa, but nor are they the majority, even among whites.
Tiresome as it seems, the white right is not all bad for Mr de Klerk: since the loss of Potchefstroom the ANC has rapidly given ground in Codesa, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, in which 19 groups are charting the course to an interim government. Plenty of obstacles still lie ahead, including the question of regional autonomy. This will not die with the referendum, because right-win Afrikaners are not the only group interested in going it alone; some blacks want to as well. But the ANC and Mr de Klerk's Nationalists both want to avoid Balkanisation, though the Nationalists favour greater devolution than does the ANC. In any event, Mr Mandela and his colleagues know that Mr de Klerk is the one man around who can lead South Africa peacefully down the road to majority rule. He is the best white hope. He is also the best black hope."

Nor should anyone doubt the economic significance of the budget, for the economy remains stuck in a recession that now rivals those of 1974-75 and 1980-81. What should Mr Lamont do?
The short answer is ""nothing"". On fiscal policy the chancellor's budget should be broadly neutral, neither adding to nor subtracting from the increase in government borrowing that the economic slowdown will anyway cause in the 1992-93 fiscal year. On monetary policy it should reaffirm the government's commitment to maintain sterling's value within the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European monetary system--and if that means higher interest rates, so be it.
To see why doing nothing is the way to promote a durable recovery, it is necessary to answer two questions. What has brought the economy so low? And what are budgets for?
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT
Most of the economic arguments for an eventful budget rest, in one way or another, on the view that the recession was avoidable. To the extent that the boom that preceded it was avoidable, this is true. But given the boom of the late 1980s (which few complained of at the time), inflation was bound to follow and, just as surely, a recession then had to be endured. Perhaps there is a way to drive down inflation without causing bankruptcies and unemployment--but governments have failed to discover it, and not for want of trying.
A gentle slowdown, it might be argued, is one thing; this slump is quite another. Even the government, in its way, appears to endorse the idea that the recession is deeper than necessary. It blames the world economy: everybody is having a recession, ministers insist. A glance at the figures shows this is nonsense. Britain has suffered much the worst decline of the big economies, precisely because it suffered the strongest surge in inflation. A less severe recession, whether relieved by looser policy or by a more buoyant world economy, would have given Britain higher inflation for longer. Whereas many advocate milder recessions, few are keen on higher inflation.
That is why it is misleading to blame the severity of the recession on sterling's membership of the ERM. The promise to defend the pound may have obliged the government to curb inflation more forcefully than it otherwise would have done but that, of course, is the system's virtue. Blame the recession on the need to get inflation down; the ERM was merely the instrument. Indeed, the ERM has probably made the rapid lowering of inflation less painful than it otherwise would have been, because it has led people to expect lower inflation and to set wages and prices accordingly. Without the ERM, in other words, even higher interest rates would have been needed to exert the same downward pressure on inflation. Maintaining the credibility of Britain's commitment to the system should be Mr Lamont's main goal on March 10th.
Fine, you might say, but that still leaves fiscal policy. Since its commitment to the ERM will anchor inflation in the medium term, the government can afford to take a softer line on borrowing--especially if the recession is deeper (ie, the fall in inflation faster) than it judges necessary. You might go further: if macroeconomic policy has any role as a dampener of fluctuations in aggregate demand, fiscal policy will need to be used more actively now that Britain's monetary policy is, in effect, devoted to managing the exchange rate. If Mr Lamont does nothing (except increase tax allowances and thresholds by enough to match inflation over the previous 12 months), government borrowing is likely to rise to more than L20 billion ($35 billion) in the financial year that begins in April. Fiscal activists of every political hue say that the chancellor should add another L3 billion or more to that deficit; and those who are Tory supporters would like the L3 billion to be used for cutting the standard rate of income tax.
In principle, the case for fiscal activism is strong. It is a case that this government has already exploited--on the spending side. Last November it announced that it would be increasing its expenditure in the 1992-93 fiscal year by L8 billion more than it had originally planned. Roughly half of that rise was due to the unavoidable effects of deepening recession (such as more unemployment pay); the rest was a discretionary stimulus (see page 65). Such activism has drawbacks, because of the delay between changes in fiscal policy and changes in demand, and because economic forecasts are fallible. Activism may aim to dampen the cycle, but often ends up amplifying it. Moreover, for the long-term health of an economy, no government should use structural tools--like changes in income-tax rates for countercyclical purposes. In Britain's case today, cutting the standard rate of income tax is something that should be done only if the structure of public spending is so firmly under control that there is no likelihood of tax rates having to be raised again when the economy recovers. John Major's government shows no sign of exercising that control.
There is a way to make fiscal policy more of a stabiliser, but it involves a programme for several budgets, not one--least of all a pre-election one. The goal should be to make fiscal policy more sensitive to changes in demand, but automatically (to avoid the need for changing tax rates) and with less delay. As it happens, two ways to do this are reforms that are desirable for other reasons too. One is to shift the overall burden of taxation from direct to indirect taxes; receipts of value-added tax, for instance, are more closely tied to aggregate demand than are receipts of income tax, which lag behind according to changes in employment. Another is to shift the burden of income tax away from income that is saved and onto income that is spent. Ideally, this would involve a fully fledged expenditure tax: a cyclical rise in the savings rate (ie, a recession) would reduce tax receipts by more under such a system than under a conventional income tax.
Neither of these changes will happen on March 10th. If Mr Lamont is still set on ""doing something"", however, they point to a form of fiscal activism that would be far more suitable than taking 1p off the standard rate of tax. He could provide companies with some relief from the new unified system of business rates. This could be brought into effect quickly, so would help it many firms in distress; and it could be made temporary, to be reversed when the economy had recovered.
Unfortunately for the economy, political considerations are likely to dictate a different kind of budget. The City has been primed to expect such a big overshoot in public borrowing that electioneering tax cuts and a projected public-sector borrowing requirement of ""only"" L25 billion might well be greeted as prudent. If that proves not to be the case, sterling would quickly come under pressure. Mr Lamont would then face the political calamity of having to put interest rates up again just days after his budget--and days before the election. It would be a calamity of his own making."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224137246/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/3?accountid=14657,"""Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs Worthington"" was Noel Coward's advice. Nowadays young Miss Worthington would be wise to avoid newsrooms, publishing offices, film sets and television studios as well. The Anglo-American world has seldom heard so many complaints about the quality of books, television programmes and films. As a business, too, the media industry is in wretched shape, its leading companies crippled by debt, rapacity or fraud; sometimes--as with those run by the late Robert Maxwell--a combination of all three. Each day it seems another newspaper or magazine is closed, a television schedule trimmed, the bankruptcy lawyers summoned--or, as at Time Warner on February 20th and News Corporation's Fox on February 24th (see page 73), a top manager suddenly quits.
In any other trade, comprehensive mess would lead to prolonged self-examination. But the media business is dominated by personalities, so each disaster can be blamed on a specific individual--a studio chief who demanded too much money, an unscrupulous editor, a press baron who borrowed as if debt were drink. Such scapegoating is sometimes justified; usually it is far too convenient. Avarice and arrogance are hardly unique to the entertainment world. Nor was it only crazed tycoons who were behind the media binge of the late 1980s; some of the billions spent on takeovers came from supposedly conservative consumer-electronics companies. Whatever is wrong with the media business goes beyond mere mogul-mania.
Precisely what is wrong matters, because of the media industry's influence and size. Satellite news gave the world a peek at Tiananmen Square and the bombing of Baghdad; during crises it is CNN, not the CIA, to which America's policymakers turn first for intelligence. Less urgently, television has made Madonna as famous as Margaret Thatcher or Mother Teresa. Entertainment has replaced religion as the opium of modern man. A fix is never far away--from compact discs, videocassettes, radios, computers, posters and, occasionally, books and newspapers. Television screens are already in supermarkets and classrooms; soon they will be common in airports, fast-food restaurants, even lavatories.
Together the film and television industries will probably produce annual revenues of $200 billion by the end of the decade. Entertainment is America's second-biggest export earner, after aerospace. Thanks to technology, the media industry is also merging with the (even bigger) global information business, which includes computers and telecoms. In 1990 that combined total was worth $1.3 trillion. By 2000 it may reach $3 trillion--or roughly $1 out of every $6 of global GNP.
A future this rosy helps explain why the media business has proved irresistible even to firms, such as Sony and Matsushita, that know little about how it works; and why others, such as Germany's Bertelsmann and Britain's Thorn EMI, keep on buying as if the past year, and the near-catastrophes of some of their biggest rivals, had never happened. The great media mess, then, is an continuing mystery.
WHODUNNIT?
As with most good detective plots, solving the media mystery requires avoiding a red herring: recession, and its effect on worldwide advertising (which fell last year, for the first time in two decades). No doubt this decline has hurt the ad-dependent broadcast and print media. But the industry's contraction would not have been so severe had its expansion not been so careless, and financed by so much debt. The bloated empires of Maxwell and Giancarlo Parretti collapsed mainly under their own weight, not from the pressure of recession. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Steven Ross's Time Warner had to take drastic action to avoid a similar fate.
Together Mr Murdoch and Mr Ross took on more than $20 billion of debt to build up ""global media conglomerates"" with diverse holdings Rangoon across industries (music, film, publishing and others) as well as national borders. Other firms did the same, if less recklessly. All offer the same two rationales: that there are ""synergies"" to be had from combining the various bits of the entertainment industry; and that the media business is, perhaps uniquely, a global affair. Thus have media companies succumbed to the seductions of size. As Variety inevitably quipped, ""there's no bigness like show-bigness.""
This is where the culprit lurks. Media firms sought to build conglomerates just when other industries were dismantling them. True, there are efficiencies to be gained from bigness in the boring parts of the business, such as distribution and promotion. Vertical integration may therefore make sense: Bertelsmann's publishing offices can feed its book clubs and printing plants, just as Time Warner's film-production facilities can make movies for HBO, one of its cable-TV channels. But why should Bertelsmann own satellite-TV stations, Time Warner own magazines, and both own record companies?
In the areas where most of the value in the media business is added--on soundstages and film sets or in newsrooms--bigness inhibits rather than inspires. The ""synergies"" have proved few and far between: journalists, it turns out, win no more Pulitzer prizes just because they have a sister company that makes records. A handful of highly paid artists qualify as global media brands, but their popularity rarely proves transferable from one medium to another; think of the loss-making films of Prince, a pop star, or the lamentable crooning of Eddie Murphy, a top comedian. Such ""cross-media"" deals have been more a cost than a benefit for conglomerates. Because their employers are now ""integrated"", prima donnas routinely ask for (and get) contracts that would make Croesus blush. They are freelance, able to play giant off against giant. In Hollywood, pay packets are discussed more than films.
The American entertainment industry's exorbitant cost structure has rightly been compared to Detroit's in the mid-1960s. If the media business were truly global, that would be a far more ominous precedent than it is. In fact, it is the market for American-made films, records and novels that is global; entertainment ""software"" from virtually anywhere else (save the occasional British pop album) usually finds only a local audience. Hollywood films flicker on 85% of Europe's screens, whereas all the French movies released last year earned less outside France than ""JFK"" made in its first two months of release.
A Hollywood studio selling its wares in Paris is not a global company. It is just another American exporter. That is nothing to be ashamed of, but to pretend otherwise is costly. To help distribute its products abroad, it might want to own a portfolio of local profit-makers; but being part of a giant worldwide conglomerate is pointless. Indeed, apart from marketing movies and music, most media strategies are necessarily local. Mr Murdoch's shrewdest deals--moving his British newspapers out of Fleet Street to Wapping and starting the Fox television network in America--had little to do with the global patter he sometimes indulges in. They were sensible strategies tailored for individual markets.
BILLIONS LATER, TIME TO UNBUNDLE
Like many business fads, globalisation and synergies have often been little more than an ex post justification of an unjustifiable decision. The Time Warner merger bean as a defensive ploy by two frightened companies; only later did the group's global raison d'etre emerge. Now it seems a costly excuse for keeping the company together. In 1989 Paramount's bid for Time valued the company at $11.3 billion. Now, even after merging with Warner, the firm is worth barely $7 billion.
In other industries, many a grandiose commercial strategy has fallen apart on the shopfloor or in the supermarket. So it is with the media conglomerates. If bigger, far-flung media companies do not produce better products and profits, then their shareholders and employees will conclude that they are not worth the trouble. That realisation may soon start dawning. Let the unbundling begin."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224158416/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/4?accountid=14657,"Few environmental dilemmas are as hard to resolve as the conundrum of who should pay to clean up toxic-waste sites. Follow the ""polluter-pays"" principle and the answer seems obvious: whoever dumped the waste should foot the bill. But what if the dumper is bankrupt? Taken over? One of many? Unknown? What if the way the waste was disposed of was perfectly legal at the time? What if, as is so often the case, no clear evidence exists that the waste is harming human health? That these questions are not easy is clear from the heart-searching under way in the European Commission as it struggles to concoct a directive on environmental liability. It is clear, too, in Britain, where the government is about to compile a register of contaminated land without having thought through who should pay to clean up the mess. Both authorities are trying to increase private liability so as to limit public spending. Enthusiasm for penalising polluters should, however, be tempered by a desire to avoid America's mistakes.
Under America's 1980 Superfund legislation, pinning the bill on companies has acquired higher priority than ensuring the protection of public health. Superfund's liability provisions catch almost any company remotely involved in a site--those who sent waste to it, transported the waste, ran the site--even, in some cases, such companies' bankers. One company can be presented with the whole bill, even if others used the site and even if it was not at all negligent. Compare that with product-liability law, where a company is vulnerable only if it was at fault--ie, if it had grounds when it sold a product to believe that it was dangerous. Moreover, companies are liable only for the harm their own product does, not for their rivals' damage; and only if somebody has demonstrably been harmed. Superfund requires no such proof of damage.
The result of such provisions (see page 80) is that more attention is often paid to establishing liability than to considering the other essential question that arises when cleaning toxic wastes: to what standard should sites be cleaned? Ought cleanups to aim to restore each site to its state on the Day of Creation; or is it sometimes enough merely to seal off the site from leaks and trespassers? The answer ought to depend partly on the costs of treatment and partly on the numbers at risk from the site. But the law, intent on revenge, creates strong pressure on regulators to ignore the balance of costs and benefits.
Indeed, as private companies carry most of the costs of cleaning up, the federal government has no incentive to care about costs. Neither have individual states, which yell for as much cleaning as possible; it creates jobs and costs them nothing. Yet the evidence linking old waste sites to illness and death is often tenuous. When scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency tried to rank the various environmental problems for which the agency is responsible, old toxic-waste sites appeared as ""low to medium risk"".
A BETTER WAY
Environmentalists sometimes argue that the stern provisions of Superfund make companies much more careful about the way they dispose of their more dangerous wastes. Certainly many American companies apply stricter rules to waste disposal in foreign countries than local law requires, for fear of future Superfunds. And much research now goes into minimising the use of hazardous materials, on the grounds that it is safest not to generate toxic waste in the first place.
But such gains might equally be achieved by sensible laws on the disposal of new waste. That is where the ""polluter-pays"" principle should be most rigorously applied. A hefty tax on new waste would make companies just as careful about generating the stuff--and yield revenue to help pay for remedies. As for old sites, where waste has been negligently dumped, the dumper should be sued. But where public health is at risk, cleaning up should be a public responsibility--ideally, financed jointly by federal and local governments.
Where the environmental benefits of a clean-up do not exceed the costs, simply listing a site on a public register until it is adequately clean should give corporate owners an incentive to deal with their own land; until they do, their property will be hard to sell. The same commonsensical line suggests that standards for cleaning up need to vary with a site's location: land to be used for a motorway interchange obviously does not need to be as pristine as land next to a city's reservoir.
Without a thoughtful approach to dealing with abandoned sites, the costs to industry will become substantial, relative to the benefits to society. In the United States, for instance, companies spent $12 billion in 1990 to comply with hazardous-waste regulation, the equivalent of over 6% of investment in manufacturing industry. One of the hardest aspects of environmental policy is to persuade the public that the costs of eliminating risks rises sharply as the risks diminish. Yet for the money Americans will spend on cleaning up old sites, more lethal and irreversible environmental problems could be tackled. Revenge is rarely a sound basis for policy."

Its critics at home risk arrest, detention without trial, torture and execution; foreigners are simply ignored. The regime's most famous opponent, Aun San Suu Kyi, was last year awarded the Nobel peace prize for her non-violent campaign for democracy, but has not been freed from the house arrest that has been her lot since July 1989. Now the junta's soldiers are waging a war against the country's ethnic and religious minorities, pressing the Karen around Manerplaw (see page 38) and driving Rohingya Muslims to seek refuge in poor Bangladesh; almost 100,000 have fled in the past two months. Yet this pariah regime is petted with trade and investment by its neighbours in South-East Asia. Why?
The excuse given by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is ""constructive engagement"". Talk to Myanmar's rulers, trade with them, give them the incentive of an improving economy--and they will become less monstrous.
It is a respectable argument, used over the years to justify trade with various other monsters, from South Africa to China. Anyway, as Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, explained at ASEAN'S summit in January, ""Poor neighbours are no asset to anyone. The problems of the poor are likely to spill over in the form of refugees, smuggling, black markets, etc...Helping neighbours to become prosperous is therefore mutually beneficial.""
Well said--but disingenuous. The truth of ASEAN'S relations with Myanmar is that Thailand's business-minded generals want to exploit their neighbour's valuable hardwood forests (Thailand's own forests are exhausted and logging is now banned) and also its gems and fields of opium. Where the Thais go, others are more discreetly following. In return, General Saw Maung and the rest of the junta (including, from behind the scenes, the supposedly retired General Ne Win) get the money to buy modern weapons from China, Yugoslavia and Poland. Thus armed, the junta stays in power.
That is the realpolitik, and why should ASEAN upset Thailand, a member state, by trying to change it? ""We don't set out to change the world and our neighbours,"" says Singapore's prime minister, Goh Chok Ton. ""We don't believe in it. The culture of ASEAN is that we do not interfere.""
DISENGAGE FOR A BETTER FUTURE
In other words, let ASEAN turn a blind eye to Myanmar's misery and Thailand's greed. In that case, perhaps Mr Goh needs reminding that the other eye is short-sighted. Constructive engagement may make sense when dealing with a regime--like China's--that will respond with long-term economic policies to improve the common man's lot. It makes no sense if it sustains regimes that practise only repression.
Unhappily for the Burmese, repression has so far lasted 30 years, since Ne Win's military coup ended parliamentary democracy and directed the country along the ""Burmese way to socialism"". On the journey, one of Asia's richer nations, endowed with educated people and natural resources, has become one of the world's poorest. Does ASEAN really believe that those responsible will be converted to righteousness by signing away Myanmar's forests?
The Burmese themselves have no such illusions. In the summer of 1988 a million or so took to the streets to demand democracy. Their answer was to be killed by the hundred and imprisoned by the thousand--but the regime did promise multi-party elections. Perhaps it was to buy time; perhaps it was hubris, the conviction that the people would support the party chosen by the army. Whatever the reason, in the election of May 1990 the opposition National League for Democracy won 90% of the seats--whereupon the junta arrested all the party's leaders it could find and continued its military rule.
For how much longer? Brutish regimes do not last for ever. As the liberalisation of Vietnam promises an enlarged and richer ASEAN, it is folly to let the malign rulers of Myanmar cramp that future--when a free Myanmar could be a prosperous, not impoverished, trading partner. For its own sake, let alone Myanmar's, ASEAN's constructive engagement"" should the be with the Burmese opposition."

A decade of those headlines must tempt many people to ignore the latest one. Why worry if rich ""names""--the individuals who provide Lloyd's capital--claim they have been ripped off, especially when despite it all the market has carried on growing? Yet the most recent outburst of grumbling by names is more disturbing. This time the market's survival is at stake.
Two troubles lie at the root of the complaints. First, like many old institutions that are set in their ways, Lloyd's needs to reform its business structure. The Rowland report published in January offers a useful blueprint. Its ideas included a compulsory high-level stop-loss policy to protect names from the direst risks of trading with unlimited liability; allowing corporate bodies to join underwriting syndicates alongside names; and a system of trading in syndicate memberships.
The report did little, however, for the second trouble: the bills now hitting names. Under Lloyd's three-year accounting system, a loss of nearly L1-1/2 billion ($2.6 billion) will be reported for the 1989 trading year this June, with a similar loss expected for 1990. The biggest losers are high-risk syndicates. Though many names on these syndicates did well in the early 1980s, they now talk of foul play and of insiders being favoured over outsiders. Some are seeking injunctions to stop Lloyd's drawing on their deposits to meet claims; others plan to sue for negligence, encouraged by the settlement just won by names who sued over losses on the 1982 Outhwaite syndicate.
The Rowland taskforce considered whether to spread old-year losses around the market. It decided, rightly, against it. Names who through prudence or luck have avoided the worst losses might refuse to pick up the bill for their fellows. Even if they agreed, many bills, like those for long-tail American liability insurance, are unquantifiable--which is why so many Lloyd's accounts remain open. And Lloyd's attempt to attract new capital, individual or corporate, would surely fail if investors risked being landed with past losses. Hence the Rowland conclusion that the only salvation for unhappy names was the lure of future profits to set against their losses.
The logic is impeccable, yet the strategy may founder. If the prospect for the next two years is of lawsuits and nonpayment by names, Lloyd's could die before its future profits arrive. In insurance, confidence is all. Lloyd's reputation in America rests on Cuthbert Heath's famous instruction in 1906, after the San Francisco earthquake, that all claimants should be paid in full. If policyholders ever doubt Lloyd's ability to settle claims, their business will soon go elsewhere. That is why more must be done to placate the names--and, with them, the customers.
A good way to start is with fill disclosure. For too long, Lloyd's has covered up when it should have opened up. Claims of wrongdoing must be quickly and publicly investigated; computer records must be made available; any malpractice must be punished. The inquiry Lloyd's has invited Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), to make into the excess-of-loss market should help.
Full disclosure might discourage the litigation that is eating away at the market's trust. But if names have a good case, Lloyd's should urge the parties to settle, if only to avoid too much being siphoned off by lawyers. It took four months in court before errors-and-omissions insurers were ready to settle claims against Outhwaite. Lloyd's had earlier refused to inquire into the syndicate's losses.
GOOD FAITH AND SELF-REGULATION DO NOT MIX
These cover-ups and lack of trust lead to the biggest conclusion of all: the market should no longer be regulated by insiders. Lloyd's ruling Council is already reconsidering its ill-advised rejection of the Rowland report's notion of separating the business of regulation from market management. Three changes that go beyond Rowland are now needed.
The first is to put Lloyd's under the auspices of an independent outside body. The obvious candidate is the regulator set up by the 1986 Financial Services Act, Sir David Walker's SIB. Next should be a requirement that members' agents who look after names' interests be divorced from managing agents who run underwriting syndicates. The combined agencies that dominate the market are riven with conflicts of interest.
The third change is to choose a full-time, salaried chairman from among outside names, not market insiders. Lloyd's outside chief executives have been useful, but they have often clashed with their chairmen. Bringing in an outside chairman would symbolise the market's new promise to put names' interests first. Insurance rates are rising fast; the early 1990s should see good profits at Lloyd's. To survive to enjoy them, it must first keep its names sweet."

They are poor. With political equality on the horizon, black economic expectations too are high. Many are doomed to disappointment. All will be if South Africa's governments in the next few years mishandle the limited opportunities open to them.
The case for change is undeniable. True, some black politicians have raised hopes to unrealistic levels; and some of their followers blithely imagine that economic rights are no different from political ones, as though the right to a house or a job could be enforced by law as easily as the right to a vote or a fair trial. But by denying blacks equal opportunities, not least at school, and by condemning them to second-class jobs, apartheid ensured that they got less than their deserts and that whites got more. Some redistribution of national income is plainly in order. The much harder issues are how, how much and how fast.
South Africa is rich in minerals and in agricultural land. It has an advanced economy, at least by the standards of Africa. Overall, in income per person it ranks above Argentina or Malaysia. But income and wealth are concentrated among the few--one study of the period 1945-80 found that 5% of the people owned 88% of the wealth, as against 44% in America or 34% in Germany--and poverty abounds.
One huge obstacle to economic equality is population growth. This is currently 2.3% a year. And, as everywhere, it is the poor who are multiplying. Two-fifths of the black population of 28m (black ""independent"" states such as Transkei included) is under the age of 14, and two-thirds under the age of 27. It is unrealistic to expect population growth to slow much. A plausible guess is that the present population of 38m will rise to 48m by the end of the century and to 60m ten years later. The economy will have to grow fast just to keep pace--and from a poor start: GDP per person has fallen by 1-1/2% a year since 1981.
The poor, encouraged by their political leaders, are not, however, looking primarily to economic growth to deliver their inheritance. Their vocabulary is full of words like ""entitlement"" and ""redistribution"". This is not surprising in a country where 86% of the land was reserved fbr the white minority, where dams were built to serve white farmers while blacks carried their water in buckets, where high-voltage cables taking electricity to white towns were strung above Africans' shacks lit by paraffin. But the scope for redistribution is limited.
The obvious place to start is with the tax system: squeeze the haves to give to the have-nots. But too much squeezing would reduce economic growth, and South Africa already taxes its people quite heavily: government revenue--mostly from taxes--accounted for about 30% of GDP in 1990. That leaves no great scope for increasing the total burden. International comparisons suggest that only in richer countries can the state take more than 35% without damaging growth. Lieb Loots, a professor of economics at the University of the Western Cape, argues that taxes could be increased (for a few years) by no more than 1/2-1% of GDP a year, and then only if the economy starts to grow.
The tax structure could be changed. The top rate of income tax is currently 43%--the mean figure for OECD countries in 1990--and is set to fall by one percentage point a year to 40%. It could be raised. But Mr Loots reckons that virtually all South Africa's income tax is paid by a quarter of the population, and 70% of it by the best--off 5%. Making their pips squeak would probably act merely as a disincentive, and so hurt economic growth. If the rich are to pay more, it would be wiser to make them do so through a capital-gains tax, a tax on luxuries and, perhaps, a land tax. These would do less damage to the economy.
Should companies pay more? A value-added tax introduced at the end of last year has brought many more businesses into the tax net. A little extra revenue could be pulled in by introducing a modest business tax, applying to even the smallest traders, or by changing depreciation allowances. But the basic rate of corporation tax--also on its way down to 40%--is not low. Rather than raise this, it would be better to eliminate some tax breaks (especially for commercial farmers). Yet businesses will try to pass on any tax increase, often to the very people it is designed to help. And if they cannot, they will have less money to invest.
Privatisation appears to offer the prospect of some extra cash for government, even if only once-and-for-all. Afrikaners have never been great believers in the free market, and their taste for state intervention has been strengthened by South Africa's economic isolation. All kinds of industries have been developed by the state, to make arms, oil from coal, or other goods to replace imports hit by international sanctions.
Some of these industries, and older ones like the railways and the electricity company, could be privatised by giving away their shares. This idea is not popular either with Afrikaners or with the African National Congress, both of whom dislike any weakening of state power. The ANC regards even the current modest privatisation programme as an attempt to sell off the family silver before the servants can get their hands on it. Still--apart from its innate economic merits--this could be a way of putting some wealth into black hands.
For how long, though? Many people would probably sell their holdings at once (unless that was banned) and blow the proceeds. A lot of the shares would thus find their way rapidly into the hands of the already rich.
The easiest way for a government to raise more money--short of printing it--is to borrow. Sanctions lessened South Africa's ability to raise capital abroad (and may thus have cut one or two percentage points off economic growth in each of the past five years), but at least they have left the government owing little--2-1/2.% of its total debt--to foreigners.
Although the total debt is not big (it equalled 35% of GDP in 1990), nor yet the budget deficit (2.7% of GDP), the domestic savings rate is worryingly low: having stood at 6% in 1985, personal savings as a proportion of disposable income dropped below 1-1/2% in 1990, as incomes fell and the fiscal drag accompanying inflation pushed up the share taken as tax.
South Africa has already re-entered the European capital markets, and should soon be able to borrow from the World Bank and the IMF. But the IMF is unlikely to allow a budget deficit of more than 5% of GDP. If tax increases yield, say, an extra 1% of GDP, privatisation 1% (for a few years, and assuming assets are sold, not given away) and borrowing 2%, government revenues might rise in all by an extra 4% of GDP.
How then can government economise? It is tempting to think that ending apartheid, a hugely wasteful enterprise, and cutting military spending will release pots of money for better uses. With Namibia independent and the war in Angola over, defence spending is already being cut. But it is implausible to think it will fall from its 1990 figure of 4% of GDP to much below 2%. Ending the duplication of bureaucracy that apartheid entailed would not, says Servaas van der Berg, of the University of Stelienbosch, yield much more than 1% of GDP. So these savings together could not be expected to add much above 3% of GDP to the 4% to be gleaned from extra revenues.
EQUALISING DOWNWARDS
With a bonus of only 7% of GDP, South Africa's first democratic government will find it hard to spend much more on the mostly black poor unless its spends a lot less on the mostly white rich. The state already spends heavily on welfare, health and, especially, education. Welfare (chiefly pensions) takes 2% of GDP; health 2.7%; education 6.2%, over a fifth of the budget. In 1986 the average spent on education by the world's upper-middle-income countries was 2.9% of GDP.
Yet government spending in South Africa has always been inequitably distributed. If in future there is to be no discrimination by race, how much will there be for blacks? The utopian answer would be as much, for each, as is currently spent on whites. But that, calculates Mr van der Berg, using 1986-87 figures, would mean raising the budget fbr blacks' health, pensions and schooling about fivefold. Add in equal expenditure on housing too, and the proportion of GDP spent would have to rise from roughly 10% to 25-31%, depending on the assumptions made. Clearly the money would not be available. Nor would the needed doctors, teachers and so on.
How about equalising spending at a lower level, then; maybe the current level for ""coloureds""--people of mixed race? For education alone, the biggest item in the budget, even that would cost an extra 4% or so of GDP. The inescapable conclusion is that if spending were to be equalised it could only be at a pretty low level.
In a country about a fifth of whose inhabitants aged over 16 have never been to school, as many are illiterate, and only 1% have a university degree, education should be a high priority. But so is health. Infant mortality in South Africa, nearly 70 per 1,000 live births in 1989, was far higher than in most countries of about its level of income: the Malaysian figure that year, for instance, was 22 per 1,000 live births. The case for spending more on the poorest, particularly on preventive medicine (which currently gets no more than 5% of total public-health spending), is overwhelming.
Housing too has a claim for more money. More than 7m city-dwellers live in ""informal"" housing--shacks, outbuildings, garages. The shanty-towns springing up round every South African city testify to present needs. Future ones will be even greater: the Urban Foundation expects 12m new people in the cities by 2010.
Then there is land, perhaps the biggest of all the redistribution problems. Apartheid gave 13.7% of the land to the black majority, much of which has predictably become degraded through overgrazing and erosion. White farmers, meanwhile, enjoyed subsidies, in the form of both credit and tax breaks. Many have overborrowed. Last year the Development Bank of Southern Africa put the number of hopelessly indebted farmers at around 3,000, responsible for farming about 4m hectares (10m acres). Their land could be bought and transferred to blacks, as could perhaps 2m hectares originally assigned to the ""homelands"" but never handed over, plus another 2m around townships: 8m hectares in all. Assume that half that land is good for farming, that South African peasant farmers need no more than the 50 hectares per family that their Kenyan and Zimbabwean counterparts have received, and it would be possible to settle 80,000 families--out of millions looking for land.
THE SEARCH FOR JOBS
If more land is to be fbund for blacks, it will have to be bought from whites. Unless it is to be confiscated, or paid for with government bonds of questionable value, would it not be cheaper to find other jobs for the landless? Possibly not. Jobs are already at a premium: in terms of formal employment, 44% of the population is without work. Of those joining the workforce in the early 1960s, 90% could expect to find formal jobs. This year, even if the economy grows by 1-1/2%, as the government expects, the proportion will be less than 5%. Yet 800,000 people will be looking for work.

No longer. This is an election year, and a deal is held up both by politics and by numerous snags in a draft treaty. On February 17th, for the first time, 19 working groups from America, Mexico and Canada met in Dallas for four days. If the progress they made is any guide, there will be peace in the Middle East before there is free trade between the Yukon and the Yucatan.
On February 25th George Bush did his best to defuse one source of opposition to the NAFTA idea. The president joined Carla Hills, the United States trade representative, and William Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, in Los Angeles to unveil an ""Integrated Border Plan"" to clean up the polluted 1,600-mile frontier with Mexico. The problems are serious. Merely in the area of Laredo (in Texas) and Nuevo Laredo (in Tamaulipas), 27m gallons of raw sewage are dumped daily into the Rio Grande.
Under the new plan America will devote $380m in federal money over two years to sorting out the mess. Predictably, environmental groups have said this falls far short of what is needed. Lloyd Bentsen, a senator from Texas who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and no softheaded green, points out that Mexico, with an economy much smaller than that of the United States, will spend $460m over three years on cleaning up the border region. Even if the main problems are on the Mexican side (though often in American-owned plants), Mexico's relative generosity is striking.
Still, announcements like that of the border plan are useful for Mr Bush. Had he not promised a ""parallel agreement"" on the environment to Congress, he might never have got fast-track authority. By announcing his plan now, he can resurrect his 1988 campaign pledge to be the ""environment president"", and divide and rule the hitherto monolithic American environmentalists. Some groups, like the Sierra Club, have long been fearful that NAFTA will lead to the rapid industrialisation of Mexico, and will not be convinced by the plan. Others, like the Environmental Defence Fund, supported NAFTA, and despite their disappointment at the progress of the environmental talks will continue to do so.
The administration may thus ensure that environmentalists do not form a united lobbying front against congressional ratification of an agreement. But other difficulties with NAFTA are less amenable to clever political fixes.
There are said to be hundreds of disagreements within the secret document; whole chapters are ""bracketed"" (meaning that no text has been agreed upon) for future discussion. Especially contentious are disputes over rules of origin that decide which goods are truly ""made in North America"" and therefore qualify for duty-free export.
These ""local content"" requirements apply to all manufactured goods, but they are of particular interest to the motor industries of the three countries, which are lobbying for protection. The American car makers want a local content of 60%, to discourage Japanese competitors from using America's neighbours as platforms for exports to the American market. Mexico and Canada both fear that so high a figure would drive away welcome foreign investment.
Rows over local content have grown bitter, particularly between America and Canada. The two have exchanged accusations of protectionism in the three years since they signed their own free-trade agreement, which has served as a building block for NAFTA. But the rift widened on February 13th, when the Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, described the American customs service as ""silly and vexatious"" in calling for $17m in back duties on Canadian-made Honda Civics that it says fail to meet the local-content requirement for duty-free export to the United States.
Even if the negotiators do solve such disputes in time to present an agreement to Congress before the November elections, ratification still looks awkward. Mr Bush won extension of fast-track authority last spring despite intense opposition from trade unions and environmentalists. These lobbies have not given up even though their Democratic champion, Tom Harkin, has done poorly in the presidential race.
Paradoxically, it is developments in the Republican Party that may now provide the unions' best hope. President Bush has defined his main concerns as ""jobs, jobs and jobs"", and his Republican opponent, Patrick Buchanan, has unconditionally opposed NAFTA. If, in the next two weeks, the Buchanan message sells well in the south (which, Texas and Florida excepted, is the most protectionist region in the country), the Bush administration may discover convincing reasons not to send an agreement to Congress this year.
Meanwhile, Mexican negotiators remain unruffled by the prospect of delays. They credit the reforms undertaken by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari with attracting the foreign capital that flooded in last year. Money for Mexico's myriad investment projects will continue to pour in, they say, with or without NAFTA, because world capital markets are convinced of the irreversibility of Mexico's economic course. Mexicans think NAFTA is inevitable; the question is not whether but when.
The Canadians appear to be in no great hurry either. They are keener on settling their two-way disputes with America than on completing the three-country agreement. No pressure here, either. For the moment the pro-NAFTA Conservatives enjoy a hefty majority in Canada's parliament and no election is expected before June 1993.
That leaves the United States. Mrs Hills insists that the NAFTA negotiations remain on course. But they have clearly jumped the fast track laid down in the early days of negotiation, and agreement is unlikely to arrive on schedule. As those who are party to the negotiations are so fond of saying, ""Nothing's agreed until everything"" agreed."" And nothing's yet agreed.
MEXICO'S OILY REWARD AUSTIN, TEXAS
Every year Mexicans have a national holiday to mark the 1938 expropriation of assets from American and British oil companies. Constitutional restrictions on foreign oil investors still shape Mexican energy policy.
Pity the poor trade negotiators who have to contend with this tradition of economic nationalism in pursuit of a North American Free Trade Agreement. Although Mexico has opened parts of its petroleum industry--the number of basic petrochemicals forbidden to foreign ownership has been reduced from 34 to 19, and may soon come down to seven--the biggest issues are not yet on the table.
Mexico still bans foreign companies from oil exploration and production. Petrol stations and refineries are all owned by a national monopoly, Pemex. The Americans argue that comprehensive free trade and open investment are impossible when the most important Mexican commodity is excluded.
Economic forces are at work that may persuade the Mexicans to open up. Without American investment in oil and gas exploration, refining capacity and transport infrastructure, Mexico may soon cease to be a big oil exporter.
It already imports American natural gas. Natural-gas exports to Mexico rose from a meagre 2.3 billion cubic feet in 1988 to 35.6 billion in 1990, and more than 90% came from Texas. Texas's proximity, its abundant supply and its prices--now below production costs--make it an attractive trade partner. Pemex is using Texan natural gas to fuel new industrial growth in rapidly growing northern cities like Monterrey and Saltillo. Mexico also needs more coal to provide electricity in its northern states, and much of this is likely to come from the western United States.
The effect of rising domestic energy demand on Mexico's future oil exports is unclear. Pemex has remained silent on the subject but Francisco Inguanzo Suarez, a former Pemex official, recently said that the use of petroleum for energy in Mexico is growing by 5-6% a year, and crude output is falling by 3% a year. At this rate, he added, Pemex may not be able to maintain oil exports beyond 1994.
Much will depend on how big and exploitable Mexico's oil reserves are. The Mexican government did not invest in oil exploration during the 1980s. But Pemex recently obtained $5.6 billion in loan guarantees over five years from the United States Export-Import Bank, to launch a $20 billion capital-investment programme. If logic prevails over sentiment, there will be more such deals."

Posters are few, the excitement of New Hampshire absent. One part of Baltimore, however, bucks the trend. Along a two-block stretch of Eastern Avenue in the working-class district of Highlandtown, half the stores have posters in their windows. They are all for the same man: Paul Tsongas.
Mr Tsongas is a Greek-American, and Highlandtown is the centre of Baltimore's Greek area. In its shops, dried herbs hang from the ceiling. In its kafeneions, men (no women) smoke, play with their worry beads, drink Greek coffee and read the Athens papers, just as they might do in Piraeus. Its restaurants have the same paintings of the same impossibly blue sea and white villages that are the stock of tavernas in Greece.
On a drizzly day, Highlandtown looks slightly run-down, even seedy. In fact, Maryland's Greeks are anything but poor. At a $250-a-plate fund-raiser for Mr Tsongas in Montgomery county, one of the nation's richest areas, the name-tags are revealing: Manatos, Milakis, Aspiotis, Papadopoulos, Glakos, Ephremides. When William Schaefer, the governor of Maryland, is asked what Greek-Americans can do for Mr Tsongas, he rubs forefinger and thumb together, and adds ""lots of it"".
Charles Moskos of Northwestern University in Chicago, an authority on Greek-Americans, points out a paradox. Greek-Americans (he estimates there are 1m nationwide) are conservative and well off. In the early years of the century, Greeks were less likely than immigrants from Eastern Europe to identify with working-class or left-wing organisations. Yet, with the exception of Spiro Agnew, the disgraced vice-president of Richard Nixon (and a Baltimore man), the Greeks have produced mainly liberal Democrats. In another blow to national stereotyping, they are also men who would top anyone's list of Those Least Likely to Break Plates at a Party.
These earnest liberals include John Brademas, a much-respected congressman who is now the president of New York University, Paul Sarbanes, the senior senator from Maryland, and Mr Tsongas himself. Mr Moskos reports that, when Mr Tsongas first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts, he asked a restaurant owner for a contribution: the man wrote a cheque for $1,000, no questions asked. ""Don't you want to know where I stand on the issues?"", said Mr Tsongas. ""If I hear where you stand on the issues, I'll take my money back,"" came the reply.
In 1988 Michael Dukakis, who is fluent in Greek (Mr Tsongas is not, though he has remained closer to the Greek Orthodox church than Mr Dukakis), deliberately sought Greek-American money. Mr Tsongas came late to it. He may have felt that Greeks, once bitten, would be twice shy. Far from it; Greek-Americans remain intensely proud that one of their own is once again running for the White House.
In most of the country it is money, not votes, that Greek-Americans can deliver. An exception is New Hampshire, where Greek-Americans are concentrated in the south of the state and form a significant proportion of the population. Chris Spirou, the chairman of the state's Democratic party, emigrated from Thessaly as a teenager. He remained officially neutral in the state's primary, won by Mr Tsongas; he must have been the only Greek in the state who did.
There are a few apostates, like George Stephanopoulos, deputy campaign manager for Bill Clinton, the governor of Arkansas. Mr Stephanopoulos, like Mr Sarbanes and Mr Brademas, was a Rhodes scholar (perhaps they thought the endowment was named after the Aegean island) who worked on Mr Dukakis's campaign. He says he is the president of ""Greek-Americans for Clinton""-an organisation which probably has a membership of one."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224135644/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/10?accountid=14657,"The fifth amendment to the constitution is adamant: ""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" This concept, derived from John Locke, is known as the ""takings clause"". It sounds simple enough--but what does ""taking"" mean these days? A case now before the Supreme Court requires an answer to that question.
Suppose the government deems it a public good to return a developed beachfront to its ""natural"" wilderness. All homeowners along the beach will get full compensation for the loss of their properties. But now suppose someone buys an empty beach-front site, complete with zoning to develop it (what in Britain is called planning permission). If zoning regulations are changed to prohibit him from building on this site, will he be entitled to compensation, or just commiseration?
This is what the Supreme Court has to decide in a case, Lucas v the South Carolina Coastal Commission, for which it heard arguments on February 26th. The case concerns a property developer who bought two beach-front sites for just under $1m. Those sites are worthless now that the state has withdrawn previous planning permission--but South Carolina sees no reason to compensate him. The case is only one of several disputes about ""property rights"" that the court has decided to hear this judicial term. Its decision has brought to a head an issue that, like no other, splits conservatives from environmentalists.
Libertarians argue that any government rule or regulation that lessens the value of a property--or a business--constitutes a ""taking"", which therefore requires compensation. The most extreme advocate of property rights is Richard Epstein, a University of Chicago law professor, who describes as ""taking"" any government action that deprives without compensating. On that definition, a progressive tax can qualify.
Advocates of environmental regulation, led by the bureaucrats of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are alarmed by Epsteinian zealotry. They fear that claims for compensation under the takings clause would make their most cherished goals, such as the preservation of wetlands, too expensive. They cite another case to be decided by the court before June, CFZ Properties v Rodriguez. This concerns a development company that claims it is unfairly being prevented from building a hotel in the middle of a virgin mangrove forest in Puerto Rico. The company had been given preliminary planning permission.
The environmentalists' position may be well-intentioned, but is it justified? Property law teaches that property rights are a ""bundle"" of separate rights, including the right of indefinite ownership, the right of use and the right of disposition (including the right to abuse). Logically, each ""partial"" taking is subject to compensation. Return to Lucas. If South Carolina had seized the two sites, placed a zoning restriction on them and then handed them back, the owner would undoubtedly be entitled to compensation for the partial loss of rights. It makes no difference that the step of seizing the sites was bypassed. South Carolina therefore seems to be trying to achieve its aims on the cheap.
But the libertarian case also has flaws. As Gary Lawson of Northwestern University points out, the takings clause, written in 1791, was designed to protect individuals from the federal government. Today, almost all property-rights cases concern state and local rulings. Can the takings clause be applied to levels of government that did not exist in the framers' day, and in ways for which it was not designed?
This is probably what the Supreme Court will decide, however disappointing that may be to those who expect judicial activism. The new court may be conservative, but, with the exception of Antonin Scalia, its justices are not libertarians. They are usually more concerned with according states more rights in relation to the federal government or with reading the constitution in the context in which it was written.
The truth, it will be said, lies in the middle. But in 1922 Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes decreed that government regulation did not infringe property rights unless it went ""too far"". That vagueness was exactly what enabled governments to go too far."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224169355/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/11?accountid=14657,"It seems appropriate that Seattle is home to America's trendiest musical fad: grungerock (a cross between punk and heavy metal); still more appropriate that the leading exponent of the art should be a group called Nirvana. To jaded middle-class Americans, the north-west seems like heaven: a clean, successful world of highly paid manufacturing jobs, coffee shops and micro-breweries.
The north-west has not yet technically had a recession. Last year, while the national workforce fell by 1%, employment in Washington and Oregon edged up by 1%. Idaho's grew by 3% and Montana and Alaska recorded small rises. The slowdown has hurt--for example, housing starts in Seattle are 60% below their peak--but, comparatively, the north-west has done well. Four of the five fastest-growing states in America are in the region.
Beyond this success is a dream and a boast. The dream is ""Cascadia"": a united economic region (named after the Cascade mountains), which at its most extravagant includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Alaska and two Canadian provinces, British Columbia and Alberta. With a GNP of $250 billion, Cascadia would rank as the tenth-biggest economy in the world. So far it is all a bit too misty to be taken seriously: for example, a high-speed rail link connecting Vancouver, Seattle and Portland is a nice idea, but speeding up customs at the border might be more practical.
The boast is that Washington and Oregon have got something right. The 1982-82 recession hit the north-west particularly hard, showing up its reliance on timber and Boeing. Out of that pain emerged a plan to attract and keep businesses: a sort of ""micro-industrial"" policy. Unabashed enthusiasm for foreign investment and free trade is the most obvious part of the formula. Washington state now has the most trade-dependent economy in the nation. The north-west's leading companies--Boeing, Microsoft and Nike--are all big exporters. Japan's Waseda University is thinking of setting up a campus in Oregon. Portland is twinned with Sapporo.
Most American states rely on cash incentives to lure in businesses--and concentrate their fire on big companies. United Airlines picked up $300m to build its maintenance centre in Indianapolis. Nine cities are bidding to be home to McDonnell Douglas's new MD-12 factory. The northwestern states say they offer nothing but a well-educated workforce, and patience. (Oregon began marketing itself to Japanese electronics companies ten years ago.) They have also concentrated their fire on small businesses: 19 out of every 20 firms in Portland employ fewer than 100 people.
In choosing which industries to encourage, though, the north-west can be interventionist. ""We don't think that we can pick winners,"" says one bureaucrat. ""but we do think we can play the odds."" In 1980 Portland launched a ""strategic plan"" based on 11 industries, from biotechnology to food processing, which it has deliberately promoted. Most of the effort goes into bringing businessmen together and persuading them to talk. Seattle recently rounded up all the region's small military subcontractors. It suggested that they might form consortia, and made a lawyer available to advise them on antitrust problems.
One of Portland's key industries is semiconductors. The city has pulled in several chip makers, like Fujitsu and Intel, but is at a disadvantage compared with Silicon valley because it has no technological labour pool. With the help of the companies, the city developed a curriculum to train local college students. A good bet? Last year the semiconductor industry went into depression, so the curriculum had to be shelved. Officials insist that it will be used one day.
YES, BUT
Like most regional success stories in America, this one has its detractors. The northwestern Wirtschaftswunder, they sniff, is three parts luck to one part judgment. Most of the Californians migrating north are escaping from California's smog, gangs and immigrants, rather than embracing Seattle's charms. The region is fortunate to be the part of America closest to the thriving economies of East Asia. Even distinctively north-western innovations may hold few lessons; it is hard to see how Portland's trendy ""flexible networks"", pioneered in Denmark, would have helped Ypsilanti in Michigan to save its General Motors plant.
As the Ypsilantians would point out, luck has a way of running out. Five years ago New England basked in a glow like that now warming the cockles of north-western hearts. Its industries then hit a bad patch, just as its property bubble burst: dream became nightmare. In the north-west the timber industry, thanks partly to the spotted owl, is in a precarious way. Seattle has gangs, drugs and, as Nirvana proves, alienated youths. The region's much-vaunted education system has taken a few knocks. Neil Goldschmidt, an ex-governor of Oregon, worries that the state has 2,500 fewer university students than two years ago: ""a sure prescription for getting poorer"".
And, of course, there is Boeing, which employs nearly a tenth of Seattle's workforce. Factor in Boeing's high wages and the number of jobs it indirectly supports and roughly a quarter of Seattle's economy relies on Boeing. One local politician says, ""if you have to build your economy around one American firm, it might as well be Boeing."" The company has a $90 billion backlog of orders. But last week it announced plans to cut 6,500 jobs in Washington state.
Boeing's very success may be a danger. Joel Kotkin, a Californian economist, recently delivered a speech accusing Washington of having ""a dependency culture"", based on the company. Privately, local observers admit that the region lacks entrepreneurial talent. Nearly all its venture capital and entrepreneurs come from California."

The new ""preventive government"" promised by the Republican governor, Pete Wilson, has been tarnished by the recession. California's leading Democrats look like has-beens: Alan Cranston is retiring from the Senate this year; Willie Brown, the speaker of the state assembly, is hamstrung by new term-limit laws; Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles, just looks old.
However, the passing of the old guard may allow the state to set a new fashion--for electing women. Last year Gloria Molina, the state's most prominent Hispanic politician, was elected to the Los Angeles County Board o Supervisors, which controls an area bigger than any one of 42 of America's states. This year two women, Dianne Feinstein, a former mayor of San Francisco who nearly won the governorship in 1990, and Barbara Boxer, a congresswoman, are running for the Senate And in 1994 Mr Wilson could be challenged by a Democrat, Kathleen Brown, whose father, Pat, and brother, Jerry, have already been governors.
Such a gynarchy may not materialise. Ms Brown has made a success out of the dull job of state treasurer, in charge of California's bond rating, but she may put off her bid until 1998. Ms Boxer is less well known than one of her Democratic rivals, Lieutenant-Governor Leo McCarthy, and less well financed than another, Representative Mel Levine; even if she beats them she would face a formidable Republican congressman, Tom Campbell. Mrs Feinstein, who narrowly lost to Mr Wilson in 1990 starts as favourite against the relatively unknown incumbent senator, John Seymour; but first she has to win the nomination from Gray Davis, an accomplished fund-raiser.
COMES THE HOUR, COMES THE WOMAN
Yet all three women are testing the political ""glass ceiling"". Women account for roughly a fifth of the politicians in most state legislatures (including California's). But in Washington, where only one in 20 of Congress's members is a woman, the female touch is fainter. There are only two women senators.
Few male politicians see much mileage in deploring the shortage of women politicians publicly, let alone trying to explain it. Privately, they suggest two reasons: sexism and, not quite the same thing, the unpopularity of feminism.
In 1990, of the six women running for Senate seats, only Nancy Kassebaum, an incumbent Republican, won. Women politicians have always been easy targets at the ballot box. In 1950 Richard Nixon dispatched his opponent, Helen Douglas, by calling her ""pink right down to her underwear"". Geraldine Ferraro had to answer questions about her husband that male vice-presidential candidates never have to answer about their wives--but
then their wives have never been convicted of scheming to defraud. In the cold war, many Americans could not envisage a woman president with her hand on the nuclear trigger.
Such sexism may be deplorable; but women politicians have sometimes stirred it up. Democratic women tend to be active feminists, a category that offends more voters than it attracts. For instance, Ms Boxer's outspoken support for Anita Hill, alleged sexual harassee, might annoy the majority of men and women who supported Clarence Thomas. Many in Sacramento reckon that Mrs Feinstein lost the governorship in 1990 by appearing too strident over subjects like abortion.
Republican women have been less concerned with their sex--and more successful. Carla Hills and Lynn Martin, both members of George Bush's cabinet, are known as administrators rather than feminists. And every American's favourite woman politician, Margaret Thatcher, rarely spoke out about women's rights.
With no red peril any longer, the idea of a commander-in-chief in a skirt is surely no longer one for men to fear. Education and health are both growing issues in American politics. Many women politicians first cut their teeth on local school boards. Women are by definition outsiders, at a time when insiders are out of fashion. Mrs Feinstein has already mentioned ethical reform in Washington as her top priority.
Even abortion might win votes. During the 1980s most voters supported abortion rights but did not vote on that issue alone; now there is a chance of the right to an abortion being removed by the Supreme Court in July, just before the election.
On paper the best Senate candidate is Mrs Feinstein, but she seems to inspire respect rather than love. Ms Boxer, despite her feminist image, has a lighter touch: she has an ear for sound-bites and a good eye for gimmicks (her campaign sells boxer shorts). In the last three months of 1991 Ms Boxer raised more money than any other Senate candidate in the country. Her alliance with Ms Molina should attract Hispanics, and she is popular with Hollywood's limousine liberals.
However, the most interesting woman may be the one who is not running this year: Ms Brown. Less eccentric and cold than her brother (whose presidential bid she is diplomatically supporting), she is a pro-business liberal, rather like Paul Tsongas.
Mr Wilson's supporters fear her more than the other potential Democratic challenger, John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner. Ms Brown's weakness is her relative inexperience. In her favour are competence, looks (Ms Brown could be mistaken for one of the attractive but determined 40-something moms who dominate prime-time television)--and, of course, connections. It would be ironic if the first woman to reach the top of the tree was a sister and daughter of the old-boy network."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136913/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/13?accountid=14657,"In Mao Zedong's day, it was hard to think of an epithet more sneering than ""capitalist roader"". Etiquette changes. On February 23rd the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, published a front-page article that not only praised capitalism's historical role but called for ""adequately developing the capitalistic economy inside China"". The day before this ode to capitalism--it was the first time anyone could recall the word itself being officially approved in Communist China--the People's Daily ran another pro-reform piece. The day after, the paper carried a front-page editorial, ""Be bolder with reforms"", which had the imprimatur of the party's Central Committee. With a very public flourish, China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, is opening his campaign to install a reformist administration in China.
Mr Deng, 87, has fought the campaign before. In 1982 he tried, and failed, at the 12th Party Congress to arrange the retirement from power of both himself and the rest of the Long March generation. In 1987, at the 13th Party Congress, he thought he had succeeded. With Zhao Ziyang installed as party general secretary and the Politburo roughly balanced between reformers and conservatives, Mr Deng was able to persuade his old comrades to join him in hobbling to the wings. From there he expected to watch contentedly as Mr Zhao led China to a reformist future.
Within two years his plans were in ruins, brought down first by the austerity programme of September 1988, which suspended new initiatives in economic reform, and then--catastrophically--by the Tiananmen Square crackdown of June 1989. Mr Zhao was ousted, the authority of the conservatives was enhanced and the octogenarians were back at centre stage.
Perhaps it will be third time lucky for Mr Deng at the 14th Party Congress, due late this year. His task has been complicated, but his hand apparently strengthened, by the collapse of Soviet communism.
The Dengist analysis, well rooted in the experience of modern Asia if not in Maoist dialectics, is that the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe went about reform backwards. They should have loosened their economies much sooner, their politics later (if at all). People with full bellies, this line of thinking goes, will not complain too much about a lack of democracy.
Mr Deng has been pressing his argument more strongly, not less, since the Soviet Union bean disintegrating. People will support ""socialism"", the Dengists say, if it proves it can deliver the goods. This argues for more economic reform, since that is what has been raising Chinese living standards so quickly. It argues for being more open to the outside world, to absorb the ideas, money and technology that will help China grow. And, to ensure the ""stability"" needed for more economic experiments, it argues for continued stem political control (of the sort applied this week in Beijing, where seven more Tiananmen activists received jail terms).
The argument seems to be going Mr Deng's way. Official comments backing faster economic reform have become the common refrain in the past six months; even presumed hardliners like Li Peng, the prime minister, have contributed to them. The facts may be influencing them. With the brakes taken off the economy last year, China's GNP grew by 7% in real terms; the coastal provinces, where reform has gone farthest, had double-digit economic growth and industrial growth in the range of 25%.
Meanwhile, despite China's continued toughness with dissidents, relations with the West are better than they have been for a long time. Mr Li's recent trip to Europe and New York ended the already breached posts Tiananmen quarantining of China. The United States and China settled one trade dispute earlier this month, and the Chinese reported ""major"" progress in talks on another in Beijing this week.
True, on February 25th the American Senate voted 59-39 to place human-rights and other conditions on China's most-favoured-nation trading status, but that too was good news for China: the margin is too small to override the veto President Bush has promised. China, for its part, is confident enough to welcome not only the record amounts of foreign investment pouring in but even, according to the People's Daily encomium on capitalism, western ideas to ""enrich our culture"".
The annual meeting of China's National People's Congress, the tame parliament, which convenes on March 20th, will probably confirm the triumph of Mr Deng's reformist economic ideas. But putting them into practice, and seeing that they stick, will depend on the personnel changes approved at the Party Congress six months later. Here Mr Deng's foes, led by Chen Yun, 86, are in a stronger position to thwart him.
Last autumn the conservatives blocked the expected elevation to the now 14-strong Politburo of three reformists of varying conviction: two deputy prime ministers, Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua, and a general, Yang Baibing (brother or cousin--accounts vary--of President Yang Shangkun). Mr Deng's challenge is to unblock these appointments, and also to secure as many places as he can on the Central Committee, which has 175 full members and 110 alternates.
The likeliest way--which just goes to show the primitiveness of Chinese politics--is through a dynastic carve-up. The upper reaches of the party and government are thick with ""princelings"", the middle-aged children of the Communist founding-fathers. In many cases, most prominently that of the Deng and Yang families, there are alliances of marriage between the children. In practically all cases, the offspring have used their positions to line their pockets and prepare for the future. The speculation is that conservatives like Mr Chen might swallow more reformists on the Politburo and Central Committee if a large number of princelings--presumably more loyal to the existing order and certainly to the present ruling families--were among those promoted.
In policy terms, that might not be all bad. Well-connected people in Hong Kong who have spoken to Chen Yuan, son of Chen Yun and thus an heir-apparent, say he is a convinced capitalist. Policy, however, is unlikely to be China's big problem. Nepotism, the succession after Mr Deng and the transition from communism to mere authoritarianism are the real concerns. Mr Deng cannot deal with them. He will consider his job well done if he has put in place people who can."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224162608/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/14?accountid=14657,"The one activity the bureaucrats have failed to regulate into nice orderly behaviour in post-war Japan has been crime. Now even gangsters are to be brought under ministerial fiat. New legislation which comes into force on March 1st will, among other things, allow district governments to designate shady characters who hang out together as official boryoku-dan (violence groups).
To qualify, gangs will have to demonstrate threatening behaviour, have members with criminal records, and belong to an organisation made up of various ranks. That, amazingly, is what the preamble to the legislation says. Once thus designated, the gangsters can go about their business unmolested provided they do not break the law.
Being a yakuza (gangster) is a legitimate profession in Japan. The gangs have headquarters with their names on polished brass plates. Like other enterprises, they advertise for recruits and go about their business openly. Between them, the gangs now boast some 90,000 members--with the three biggest syndicates (Yamaguchi-gumi, Inagawakai and Sumiyoshi-rengo-kai) accounting for half the membership. Their main source of revenue is from trafficking in stimulants, especially crystal methamphetamine (known as ice). American narcotics agents reckon that 90% of the ice on the streets of Hawaii is smuggled in by Japanese gangsters. As a business, organised crime in Japan is thought to make around Y1.5 trillion ($11 billion) a year. And that excludes the gangs' new interests in property development and golf clubs.
The gangs became interested in property in the 1980s when land prices were going through the roof. Anyone who happened to own some land next to a vacant plot became the victim of strong-arm tactics by a gang. Its aim was to help a property agent put together a plot big enough for a developer to build a large office block on. It did not take the gangs long to decide to become property developers themselves.
The Japanese police have been unable to prevent gangs from laundering illicit earnings by investing in property and other legitimate businesses. Nor have they been able to stop them from collecting protection money or forcing businesses to deal with the gangs' affiliated suppliers. A profitable new sideline is collecting damages on behalf of motorists involved in traffic accidents. Often the motorists are the gangsters themselves, and the incidents are not so accidental. The gangsters stop just short of breaking the law on blackmail or coercion by using insinuation rather than violence to get results. However, under provisions of the new legislation coming into force next week, insinuation will be illegal, too.
What does the ordinary Japanese say about the gangsters' licence to misbehave? The yakuza, with their tattooed bodies and strict rituals, used to have a romantic reputation. They were once given credit for defending the interests of local neighbourhoods. But now they tend to be associated with violence and drugs.
Open warfare between the bigger gangs is threatened. The Yamaguchi-gumi gang, with its 30,000 members, has outgrown its provincial base in Kobe and the surrounding region of Osaka. It has recently been trying to muscle into Sumiyoshi-rengo-kai's territory in the Tokyo area.
One night two years ago Yamaguchigumi's top boss, along with an army of bodyguards, brazenly had a night out in a Ginza bar that was Sumiyoshi-rengo-kai's home turf. A milee ensued as some 150 young thugs bloodied one another, startling the police in what was previously a peaceful patch. Since then Yamaguchi-gumi has been setting up property and financial-services companies in and around Tokyo.
The new laws, which also cover drugs and restrict the use of firearms and swords, will unquestionably make life tougher for organised crime in Japan. But they are not going to drive the gangs out of business. Many people suspect Japan's crime syndicates could move even deeper into commercial business. Yamaguchi-gumi has ordered its 117 affiliated gangs to register as boards. Local bosses were told to make themselves chairmen or presidents of their companies and elect their most talented lieutenants as directors. Each company is to be capitalised at Y10m.
Gangs all over Japan have been tearing down their old headquarters signs and turning themselves into businesses. One enterprising gang in Kyushu tried to become a co-operative. Just in time, the police managed to get the application thrown out. Had the gang succeeded, it would have been eligible for Y2 billion worth of business loans from the district and national governments. Other gangs are turning themselves into political organisations. Using rightist groups with loudspeaker vans blaring accusations at petty wrongdoer's has long been a yakuza way of practising extortion.
But the prize for audacity goes to a gang in the Osaka area that plans to evade the new legislation by registering itself as a religious order. ""My religion will be Ninkyodo, the way of the chivalrous spirit,"" a straightfaced boss told reporters, ""and I will be the spiritual leader. ""Judging from the wealth pouring into many Japanese temples, organised religion could well be more profitable than even organised crime."

The answer, according to their standing orders, is that they will first contact their commanding officer in Phnom Penh, who will then contact the Security Council in New York for instructions on what to do next. In the meantime, the peacekeepers will twiddle their thumbs.
The powerlessness and vulnerability of the UN soldiers (an Australian colonel was wounded on February 26th) in Cambodia are just two of the problems facing what could become the largest peacekeeping operation ever undertaken by the UN. Four months after the Cambodian peace agreement was signed in Paris, UNAMIC still has a total budget of only $45m, over half of which is supposed to be spent on clearing mines. Negotiations to establish a United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) are bogged down by bureaucracy, although the Security Council is likely to approve an initial plan to send 15,900 troops and 1,500 civilian administrators to Cambodia.
The problem will be getting the money to pay them. Governments receive $111 a day for each of their soldiers employed in a peacekeeping operation. That means the UN will have to find $1.8m a day to pay for its blue-capped troops in Cambodia. It will also need to bring in vehicles, communications equipment, housing, food--in short, everything. The whole operation, which will last for at least 18 months, is expected to cost over $2 billion--excluding any money to begin rebuilding the shattered economy.
Because a Japanese, Yasushi Akashi, has been appointed head of UNTAC, Japan might offer to pay a quarter of the total cost, or twice its assessed contribution. But who will provide the rest? ""If we had appealed for money in October, when the peace agreements were signed and some momentum had built up, it would have been much easier,"" says a UN official. ""Now Cambodia has to compete for money with El Salvador and Yugoslavia, in both of which rich countries have more direct interests.""
One answer would be to cut costs. Yet the UN's Cambodia role is inherently expensive. UNTAC will have five tasks: monitoring the ceasefire; supervising the cantonments for the remaining armies of the four Cambodian factions; helping almost 700,000 people (refugees in Thailand, displaced people, inside Cambodia and soldiers being demobilised from the various armies) to resume a normal life; running the main ministries of the government; and preparing for elections. Trying to perform all five jobs will be a nightmare.
The easiest way for the UN to save money would be to shorten UNTAC's life. Uch Kiman, a senior official in the office of Hun Sen, the prime minister of the Phnom Penh government, says this may be no bad thing: ""We need UNTAC at the right moment to defuse tension, separate the armies and start the process of elections. Once the process has started, the Cambodian people will look after themselves. It's a question of the beginning."" Mr Kiman believes that, if only UNTAC had been deployed on time and in force, then it might have been possible to reduce its manpower after a few months and thus save money. This opportunity has been missed. Meanwhile, the rainy season approaches--and not a lot happens in Cambodia after late May, when the rains begin.
The unasked question is whether UNTAC is the best way of helping most Cambodians. The unstable peace is a step forward for the four-fifths of the population that live in the countryside, but a modest one. They are still preyed on by bandits wearing the uniforms of one or other of the factions and have no access to the most basic services, such as schools and clinics. A more effective, and certainly cheaper, way for the UN to transform their lives might simply be to ensure that no more arms reach the Cambodian factions through neighbouring Thailand and Vietnam."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224162659/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/16?accountid=14657,"The Karen guerrillas used to operate close to the capital, in the days when it was called Rangoon. But that was in the Burma of more than 40 years ago. The Karen, an ethnic group that seeks autonomy, are now confined to some bits of territory around the town of Manerplaw, near the border with Thailand. Even these are endangered. Along with other changes made by the ruling junta--Burma has become Myanmar, Rangoon has become Yangon--it seems intent on ending the country's several insurgencies. The present offensive against the Karen by the army is fiercer than anything in previous years.
Karen fighters defending Manerplaw number no more than 2,000. Against them the junta has deployed more than 7,500 troops, backed by artillery. Villages in the Manerplaw area are being bombed.
Watching the battle from a hilltop observation post, Bo Mya, a portly Baptist who is president of the Karen National Union, admits concern. But he points out that to reach Manerplaw the junta's soldiers must first gain control of Sleeping Dog Mountain. The mountain commands crossings over the Salween River and the route to Manerplaw six miles away. The mountain is held by the Karens and the attackers are taking casualties. The most recent figures claimed by the Karen were 128 soldiers dead and some 500 wounded, for the loss of 20 Karen killed and some 75 wounded.
The junta is said to have told its soldiers that it wants Manerplaw captured by March 27th, Armed Forces Day. The Karen need to hold out until May, the start of the rainy season, when fighting becomes nearly impossible for much of the rest of the year. But if the army fails now, it will return next year. Manerplaw would be a special prize for the junta. The town is not only the headquarters of the Karen, it is the seat of the ""parallel government"" set up by fugitive members of the National League for Democracy. Under Aung San Suu Kyi, the winner of the Nobel peace prize now under house arrest in Yangon, the League won a general election in May 1990. The result was not honoured by the junta. By losing territory over the years, the Karen have also lost much of the border trade that provided money to buy arms and other essentials. The guerrillas say they are not short of weapons but, revealingly, put a premium on capturing them from the enemy. A Karen officer will not lose his rank for losing men in battle, his fighters say grimly, but he may for losing arms.
The rebels hope they can hold on until the junta somehow collapses. But it shows no sign of doing so yet. Its forces are said to number 300,000, almost twice as many as a few years ago. The sale of logging concessions to Thais, together with drug trafficking, helped the junta to buy arms worth more than $1 billion last year. The suppliers were China, Singapore, Poland, Yugoslavia and Pakistan.
The junta is regarded with disapproval by much of the outside world. It has a deplorable record for the ill-treatment of dissidents. Apart from moving against the Karen in Manerplaw and in other sanctuaries, among them Kawmoorah and Tenasserim, it is attacking Kachin and Shan minorities in the north and north-east. It is also conducting a pogrom against Rohingya Muslims in Arakan, in the west of the country. More than 100,000 Rohingyas have fled from their burning villages and taken refuge in Bangladesh.
Yet few countries close to Myanmar are willing to condemn it. They say that complaints about human rights come mainly from western countries that do not understand Asia. Some of the soldier-politicians who run Thailand have done lucrative teak-logging deals with Myanmar's junta, and have no wish to see a change of government in Yangon.
Such contacts make the Karen particularly uneasy. They know that Manerplaw would be more vulnerable if Myanmar were allowed to attack it from Thailand. It was just such a manoeuvre in 1989 that enabled Myanmar's soldiers to overrun a series of Karen strongholds. In the past five months they have crossed the Thai border five times, say the Karen. However, when the intruders came across the border most recently, aircraft of the Thai air force dropped a couple of bombs on them. Clearly there is a limit to the liberties Thailand will allow Myanmar's rulers."

The roughness of this talk, emerging from the latest round of peace talks in Washington, reflects the consternation of Israelis, and a new confidence among Palestinians, at the steeliness of President George Bush's refusal to accept the way the Israelis are pre-empting the future of the occupied territories by filling them with Jewish settlers.
It has always been American policy to oppose Israeli settlement in the West Bank and Gaza but, until now, the policy has been mumbled through toothless gums. On February 24th James Baker gave it teeth. The secretary of state told Congress that the administration would back Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees over five years only if Israel froze everything to do with settlements. Israel might be allowed a ""lesser ; amount"" on a year-by-year basis if it chose to complete work begun before January 1st but then there would be a financial penalty of a dollar for every dollar spent on settlement, including roads and sewers.
Although some voices in the Israeli government still say that all is open for discussion, Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, has raised the right to build and settle in the occupied territories to the level of a principle from which there can be no retreat. A compromise looks all but impossible. Mr Shamir has kept quiet but an Israeli diplomat in Washington remarks that his government has been given the choice ""between eating and breathing"". A $2 billion loan guarantee had rashly been incorporated into Israel's 1992 budget. Mustering bravado, the finance minister now says that the country can manage without it. But its lack will mean fewer jobs, exacerbating the plight of new immigrants.
Hours before Mr Baker spoke out, Mr Shamir told a group of American Jews that there was a difference between Israeli ""presence and sovereignty"". The flaw in his argument was highlighted by his housing minister, Ariel Sharon, who told the group that 22,000 new Israeli homes are currently being built in the occupied territories, not 13,000 as America had been led to believe.
The Palestinians, who reckon Israel has used the peace talks that began last October to accelerate the settlement rate, say that nothing substantive can be discussed while the building goes on. They dismissed with contempt some outline proposals for self-rule that Israel put forward this week, calling the offer even meaner than the one proposed ten years ago. ""Sovereignty over land and water and financial affairs would remain in [Israeli] hands,"" said Haider Abdel Shafi, the chief Palestinian delegate; ""it is a way of perpetuating the status quo."" His spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, savaged the proposals as ""an insult to our intelligence"". The talks, which are supposed to continue until March 4th, will be renewed later in the year, possibly in Europe.
The administration's toughness over the credits, challenging the received wisdom that says no American politician takes on Israel in election year, reflects its desire to keep the peace talks going. An opinion poll showing more than 70% support for the president's firmness indicates that the political cost will be light. The public is in no mood to give money away, Mr Bush has nothing to fear on this score from his rival in the primaries, Patrick Buchanan (a longtime critic of Israel), and Israel's American supporters are as split as the Israelis themselves.
Pro-Israeli congressmen would have no hope of overriding a presidential veto if they went ahead and voted for the credits. The Democratic chairmen of the committees responsible for foreign aid are squarely behind the president. In fact, one of them, Senator Patrick Leahy, was the author of the dollar-for-dollar formula.
With Israel itself going to the polls in June, the Americans are being accused of playing Israeli politics by trying to weaken the Likud's hand against Labour. Perhaps to soften this impression, the administration is said to be working with Congress on an amended ""Leahy formula"". A legislative fudge could be put in the foreign-aid bill that Congress will be trying to pass in March. The credits would be agreed to in principle, but negotiations would continue with Israel and the administration would have full discretion to withhold the money.
But many Israelis believe that it was no coincidence that Mr Baker hardened America's position a few days after the Labour Party elected Yitzhak Rabin to lead it into the June election. Mr Rabin is thought to offer the first serious challenge to the Likud since it took office 15 years ago; he is also well known and regarded in Washington. Although Mr Rabin would not have accepted a total freeze on construction--he is committed to Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley--he would have arrived at a compromise."

Iran's interest in winning over the region reaches far back (and its involvement is centuries old). But its goals have changed. To protect itself against its perceived enemy, the United States, Iran wants to create a shield where its influence is paramount--a shield that must include the Muslim republics of the new Commonwealth of Independent States.
From the day the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Iran has supported an underground network to revive and strengthen Islam in the southern republics. America accuses Iran of trying to export its revolution to these states. No, says Iran, it just has a duty to protect Islam in countries that are already predominantly Muslim.
This duty includes protecting it against the inroads of another Muslim neighbour, Turkey. The Turks, claims the hardline press in Tehran, have received a substantial budget from Washington ""to buy the Muslims of Central Asia"" as part of its campaign against the spread of Islam. The newly founded Caspian Council (which links Iran, Turkmenia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia) is an open attempt to cut Turkey out and bolster the region against ""the plotting of America through the Turks"".
American spokesmen find comfort in the thought that the Muslims of Central Asia are not of the firebrand variety associated with Iran, that they mostly speak Turkish not Farsi, and that, having freed themselves of communism, they will reject revolutionary Islam. This theory disregards historical links. Most of the republics were once part of the Persian empire or closely associated with it; centuries on, they still share the same music, the same handicrafts, much of the same culture.
Moreover, Turkish, the main language in most of the Central Asian states, is also widely spoken in northern Iran. Iranian ""Turks"" are among the most influential in Tehran, having for centuries dominated the army. Still, in a bid to improve the situation, Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, recently signed an agreement with the Afghan mujahideen and Farsi-speaking Tajikistan to set up an association ""to expand Farsi in the Asian states"".
Azerbaijan and Iran face the common threat of the Azeri faction that calls for a united republic (20m Azeris live in Iran, 7m in the ex-Soviet Union). An Iranian foreign office official emphasises that neither government wants to see unrest in the area. An Azerbaijani leader who was in Tehran in February as part of the official delegation to a meeting of the Economic Co-operation Organisation (a half-forgotten group that linked Iran, Turkey and Pakistan, and which Azerbaijan, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kirgizia have now joined), argued that the people of Central Asia ""want to return to their traditional culture, and above all to their religion"". He dismissed reports of growing Islamic fundamentalism as yet another American plot. The Iranians, expanding on this, claim that talk of fundamentalism is used by America ""to justify interfering in relations between sovereign states.""
The relations between Iran and the new-born republics include a multitude of trade deals. Iran, which has made an increase in non-oil exports the main target of its latest five-year plan, desperately requires new markets for its fledgling industries. Carpets, saffron and pistachio nuts are no longer enough; Iran has high hopes of selling pharmaceuticals, farm machinery and cars as well as oil and oil products to the ex-Soviet Union.
The political element is crucial. ""Now that the Americans are looking for Muslims under their beds instead of reds,"" says a political scientist in Tehran, ""both sides will play the influence game in whatever nation they can find a foothold."""

His decision to call a snap whites-only referendum on March 17th to establish ""once and for all"" whether most whites support him in his quest for a negotiated settlement with South Africa's black majority is proving a devastating counter-move.
Instead of taking up the challenge at once, the Conservative Party spent a couple of days squabbling about how to respond. Its executive committee first decided to boycott the referendum. But this would have done the party no good as Mr de Klerk has said that he will regard any ""yes"" vote, no matter how low the turnout, as a mandate to go ahead. There was then a rebellion in the party's 42-member parliamentary caucus, and the executive was forced to backtrack and agree to campaign for a ""no"" vote.
Andries Treurnicht, the Conservatives' leader, put his best face forward when he emerged from the caucus, six hours later than scheduled, to address a press conference on February 25th. The party, he said, would campaign in the ""spirit of Potchefstroom"" He denied that there were serious differences; the revolt, he argued, was evidence of the party's democratic ways.
But the party's deputy leader, Ferdi Hartzenberg, declined to join Mr Treurnicht at the press conference. Mr Hartzenberg is a hardliner cast in the mould of Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid. Jubilantly present was Koos van der Merwe, leader of the New Right faction that favours a break from Verwoerdian days.
Mr van der Merwe is the author of a secret document, leaked to the press last year, that goes against prevailing party policy by arguing that the party should attend Codesa, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. The report's premise is that the process started by Mr de Klerk is irreversible; the party, therefore, should not boycott the negotiations but join them to press for a white right to ""self-determination"",
Mr van der Merwe's document was rejected and he himself removed from his job as the party's information chief. But his success at the caucus rebellion indicates that his ideas are still alive. The confusion within the party could lead to a more formal split between the New Right and the Verwoerd hardliners. More important, it might lead to the Conservatives reversing their previous policy and accepting the invitation to join Codesa in order to plead their case for a white state.
For the present, however, the party is expected to put its differences aside and campaign vigorously for a rejection of Mr de Klerk's vote of confidence. Its chances of success appear to be slight. In the 1989 general election, Mr de Klerk's National Party won 48% of the vote, against 32% for the Conservatives. The remaining 20% went to the pro-settlement Democratic Party, which has already said it will campaign for a ""yes"" vote.
Because the Conservatives are strong in the over-represented rural areas, they might have been able to win a general election with less than half the votes. But they are committed to a fight in which Mr de Klerk has chosen the terrain and timing, a referendum rather than a general election and sooner rather than later.
The president says that he will treat the referendum as fulfilment of his pledge, made before the 1989 election, to consult the white electorate before altering the constitution. If he wins on March 17th, the way will be open to him, he says, to ""enter into binding agreements"" at Codesa. For the Conservatives, Potch is starting to look like botch."

Nicaragua, two years after the end of the war, is still struggling to reintegrate the men who did the fighting. El Salvador has just begun. Both would do well to look south towards Colombia, a country with much experience of both guerrilla war and negotiated peace.
Of the many Colombian guerrilla and paramilitary groups that took up arms in the 1970s, five have so far negotiated peace with the reforming government of President Cesar Gaviria. The first, two years ago, was the M-19 movement, one of the largest groups and one which claims, unlike some of the others, that it was never Marxist. Its leaders have done a quick-change act, swapping combat fatigues for dark suits (over body armour), and have planted themselves firmly in the political frame.
It has been harder for their followers--several thousand fighters, which means, with their families, up to 500,000 people--to convert to peace. Most have little formal education and few useful skills. They must leave their guerrilla bands, and adjust to urban life after years in remote mountain camps.
For the ex-combatants who dared reveal their names as they laid down their weapons, the government has designed and paid for a training programme called Reintegration. Its aim is to take 4,000 men and women aged from 15 to 40 through 11 years of school in just 18 months; the first students will graduate this summer. The scheme also offers basic business training, psychiatric care and, above all, help in understanding how a modern urban society works.
The programme, which includes monthly cash handouts, was negotiated as part of the original ceasefire deal. M-19 led the way to the negotiating table, but forgot its troops. It tried to make up for this later but its tardiness means that its ex-guerrillas get only 50,000 pesos ($85) a month to help them throuh, while those of rival movements get up to 75,000 pesos.
Whatever they get, they need help to spend the money sensibly. ""In the camps, the commander was responsible for food, clothes, money, everything. After demobilisation, they had to learn to look after themselves,"" says Reintegration's national co-ordinator, Rodrigo Rojos. As soldiers in a close-knit society, they shared a strong sense of common purpose. Arriving in the cities, the ex-guerrillas become depressed and confused. Young people may find that they have splashed their monthly payments in a few days.
Ex-guerrillas have many enemies. For leaders such as M-19'S Antonio Navarro Wolff, peace means sleeping in a bunker, wearing bullet-proof clothes and being surrounded by armed bodyguards. Mr Navarro's predecessor, Carlos Pizarro, was killed days after the group left the mountains. For ordinary soldiers, the risks are fewer but they still have a struggle ahead of them.
Fredy Cortes, 30 years old, spent 13 years as a radio-operator for M-19, both as a clandestino in the mountains and undercover as an urbano in the city. His city friends were angry when they found out about his double life, but most came to accept him. His employers were not so understanding, and he has had to take work as a government messenger. He studies for four hours, three nights a week at Reintegration's special classes, and is hoping for a scarce university place in architecture.
Susana, aged 15, with only two years of primary school and classes ""now and then"" in the mountains, struggles with maths and has trouble reading and writing. She joined"" M-19 at the age of eight, when her guerrilla parents considered her ready. Her career ambitions are split between social work and fashion design.
Reintegration seems to be workin for some--though on February 26th 20 ex-guerrillas took over the Spanish embassy in Bogota to protest that it was not working for them. Mr Gaviria's government is now considering extending the programme to other outcasts. The most controversial would be the sicarios, the professional killers--mostly teenagers--whose work for the drug cartels has helped make violence the most common cause of death among Colombian men. Other potential recruits are the peasant self-defence armies, the paramilitary groups formed to fight the guerrillas and the youth gangs that wage bloody wars in the slums."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224158013/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/21?accountid=14657,"When Germany turns east, others are not sure whether to cheer or tremble. So it was when Willy Brandt launched West Germany on its Ostpolitik just over two decades ago; so it is now that newly united Germany, its clout further increased by the collapse of the Soviet Union, is forging ahead with Ostpolitik mark-two.
Given the right conditions, Germany was bound to make the running in the region. It is linked to the East by geography and history, not least through the nearly 3m ethnic Germans who live there. As Europe's strongest economy, despite the unity strains, it has a lot of the goods, cash and know-how the newly merging eastern democracies crave. Small wonder that Germany's aid to the area since 1989--more than DM100 billion ($60 billion) including state-backed export guarantees--far exceeds that of other western states; that its firms are the biggest investors there; that it is expanding scientific and cultural ties; and that its efforts still run far behind demand.
To hear some German officials talk you might think this was a burden grudgingly shouldered on behalf of the West to help keep the East stable. In part that is true. At present the costs of the new Ostpolitik look huge and the rewards piffling. Last year Germany exported to the entire East (including the ex-Soviet Union) only about as much as it did to Austria. But when German leaders look a decade or so ahead, their eyes gleam. According to a recent poll, more than half of Germany's top managers and politicians reckon that in the long term there will be bigger business opportunities in Eastern than in Western Europe.
Does that imply Germany may reduce its economic and political ties to the West? Perish the thought, the top people reply; it is just that in the East there is a big catching-up job to do. That is true, but it still irks western countries smarting from recent German pushiness over Yugoslavia, western firms regularly pipped in the East by German competitors and even eastern states themselves. And though the easterners are crying out for German help, memories of Nazi invasion still make them wary of too much German influence.
That ambivalence towards the new Ostpolitik was plain enough in Czechoslovakia this week when Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, arrived to sign one of the good-neighbour treaties the Germans have now concluded with nearly all East European states. President Vaclav Havel has pooh-poohed fears of German domination. He angered domestic critics by decrying the expulsion of millions of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war.
But plenty of Czechs complain all the same that German firms looking for skilled, cheap labour have been muscling into one industry after another. Between them they account for more than 80% of foreign investment. Volkswagen and Daimler-Benz (vehicles) snatched huge deals from competitors including Renault and Fiat; Siemens (electricals) beat Westinghouse and ABB in the drive to acquire a power station and locomotive builder; Kirch of Munich took over a popular television magazine; Bayernwerk (a utility) is pushing into the energy sector--and so on.
Local sensitivity to the arrival of all these heavyweights was increased by dilly-dallying over the new treaty in Germany. A lot of Czechoslovaks believe (rightly) that Mr Kohl delayed signing because of pressure from the right wing of his coalition. It wanted the pact amended to cover compensation for the expelled Sudetens. In the event the treaty was not changed. But the delay upset his partners in Prague--much as his delay in 1990 in unambiguously recognising the Oder-Neisse line as Poland's western border angered the Poles.
Now the Poles have other reasons to be touchy about their frontier. Lots of Ossis (eastern Germans) armed with hard D-marks have taken to swarming into Poland and flaunting their wealth on shopping sprees. Bitter for the Poles, who are free to go the other way but have little to spend, and who have no rich western guardian to give them handouts. At the same time German schemes for an economic development zone straddling the border have not got far, not least because the Poles fear they are a cover for ""colonisation"".
It is not all friction and bad news. Despite the problems, Bavarian and Czech border regions are starting to co-operate as never before in health, education and local government; Saxony is pressing for cross-border efforts with the Czechs and Poles to clean up the environment; some of the Sudeten Germans who were expelled are putting up money to restore churches and other buildings in their former home towns.
Relations with Hungary are relatively problem-free. This may be partly because Germany and Hungary have no common border, but also because the Hungarians have fewer obvious hang-ups about united Germany. Indeed, a beaming Mr Kohl was egged on by Hungarian leaders in Budapest earlier this month to seek a still weightier international role for his country.
Whatever the worries about German domination elsewhere in the east, demand is soaring for German language courses, literature and political information. One common criticism is that the Germans are still doing too little to meet it, despite the spread in Eastern Europe of the Goethe Institute network and the German political foundations. In this field at least the Americans and British were quicker off the mark.
Even if Germany is right that its new Ostpolitik will bring big economic benefits in the long run, can it afford the bills in the meantime? Hardly, given the soaring costs of unity, record government borrowing and high interest rates which make the rest of Europe squirm, as well as the Germans. Hence Mr Kohl's repeated calls for other western states to stump up more money to help Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union. The Germans are uncomfortably aware that, if economic collapse bring mass migration from the East, they will be first in line.
To some extent they already are. Last year alone 222,000 ethnic Germans came to Germany from the East (plus 256,000 asylum-seekers, notably from Yugoslavia and Romania). Time was when the Bonn government paid communist regimes to let ethnic Germans travel west. Now it is trying to ensure that they and other potential migrants feel well enough off to stay put. That means large bills for a long while yet which Germany can hardly duck, whatever its commitments elsewhere. Mr Kohl's new Ostpolitik may well turn up trumps for the Germans eventually, but they will have to shake out their money boxes first."

So the rise of ecologists comes as a bit of a surprise. Opinion polls now predict that the two green parties, the Verts and Generation Ecologie, will between them take 16% of the vote in the regional elections on March 22nd. That puts them on a par with the National Front and could leave ggreens holding the balance of power in many regions.
A small, fragmented ggreen movement has existed in France since the early 1970s. Though it won some notoriety fighting the building of nuclear power stations, new motorways and the like, it never succeeded in attracting more than 4-5% of the vote. Then, three years ago, the green vote took off.
International worry about the ozone layer and the world's rain forests helped to make environmental issues both fashionable and respectable. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster had made people query the wisdom of France's heavy dependence on nuclear power for its energy. The end of the cold war weakened the national consensus about France's nuclear deterrent. At the same time a pervasive sense of boredom with the three main traditional parties prompted voters to turn to new ones.
For many, the Verts, formed out of a merger in 1984 between two smaller green movements, provided a more acceptable alternative than the extreme-right National Front. Their presidential candidate, Antoine Waechter, a mild-mannered, short-haired, besuited specialist in beavers and martens with a doctorate in ecological engineering, had managed to corner only 2.8% of the vote in the 1988 presidential election. But in the municipal elections the following year, the Verts surprised even themselves by winning 12-15% in many areas, and over 20% in a few. They continued their charge in the election for the European Parliament a few months later, winning nearly 11% of the national vote and nine seats--more than Germany's Ggreens.
The three main political parties in France-the neoGaullist Rassemblement pour la Republique, the centre-right Union pour la Democratie Francaise, and the Socialists--became more fervently verdant. But the Verts, who have always insisted that they are ""neither left, nor right"", continued to reject all overtures. So in 1990 Brice Lalonde, the greens' presidential candidate in 1981 and minister for the environment since 1988, decided, with the blessing of President Francois Mitterrand, to set up his own rival green movement, Generation Ecologie. This, he hoped, would attract Socialists who had gone over to the Verts;
Generation Ecologie was supposed to remain firmly in the centre-left camp of the ""presidential majority"", the tag given to all those, Socialist or not, willing to support Mr Mitterrand's government. But now the Socialists are growing anxious about the movement's success and independence. Generation Ecologie is not only poaching votes from the Verts, but also from them.
According to some polls, Generation Ecologie has overtaken the older-established Verts, being credited with 8.5% of the vote, compared with their 7.5%. Both parties make the environment the heart of their programmes, but their characters are quite different. The Verts, with their support for unilateral disarmament, the dismantling of France's nuclear-energy programme and the reduction of the working week to 30 hours, are much more radical and utopian. Generation Ecologie prefers vague talk of cuts in defence spending, introducing a ""pause"" in the nuclear-power programme and job sharing. Generation Ecologie sees the Verts as incompetent extremists. The Verts retort that Generation Ecologie is merely a Paris-centred, over-personalised vehicle for Mr Lalonde's political ambitions, with no real convictions or programme
Despite their differences, the two parties tend to attract similar voters--mostly aged 25-49, middle-class and left-leaning, though a sizeable minority are from the right. Their desire to snub the traditional parties rivals their concern for the environment. However, in contrast to the other main protest party, the National Front, the greens are much less well-organised and far less methodical in their pursuit of power. They are still more like environmental pressure groups than real political parties. Theirs may be the most popular political movement in France today, but they are still green around the ears."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224142755/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/23?accountid=14657,"Might the far right take power in Russia? It would be foolish to say flatly no. All over Eastern Europe reactionary nationalists have sought to make the most of hard times. In Poland Stanislav Tyminski won 26% of the vote in the first round of the 1990 presidential election on a platform accusing the government of selling Polish industry too cheaply to foreigners. Russia, like other ex-communist countries, has large numbers of disgruntled industrial workers who now fear for their jobs.
Indeed, support for the reactionaries in Russia is potentially far larger than in Poland. Russia has its share of discontented former Communist apparatchiks. But it also has millions of Russians living outside the Russian federation, or else in parts of Russia where other people form the majority, such as Tatarstan and Checheno-Ingushetia.
In recent weeks two groupsthe Reds and the Browns--have organised noisy and occasionally violent demonstrations in an attempt to attract support from expatriate Russians. Although on the face of it these groups are at opposite ends of the political spectrum, their views, as is the way with extremists, sometimes overlap.
The Reds are the old-fashioned Communists. Although the Communist Party is now banned in Russia, a bunch of neo-communist groups have sprung up, demanding the restoration of the Soviet Union and the reversal of economic reform. These include the Working People's Socialist Party; the Communist (Bolshevik) Party, founded by a Stalinist, Nina Andreeva; and the Russian Communist Workers' Party, whose ""shadow cabinet"" includes two members of last August's junta who are still in jail.
The Browns get their name from the ""brown plague"", the term for the outbreak of anti-Semitic pogroms in late-tsarist Russia. Modern Browns are extreme right-wingers who share the communists' distaste for democracy but, unlike them, accept private property. The leading Brown group is called Nashi (Ours). Founded in St Petersburg late last year, Nashi's leaders include two colonels, Viktor Alksnis and Nikolai Petrushenko, who led the hardline Soyuz (Union) faction in the now disbanded Soviet parliament; the editor of Nash Sovremennik (Our Contemporary), a Russian chauvinist literary magazine; another hardline soldier, General Albert Makashov, who ran against Boris Yeltsin for the Russian presidency last year, and the man widely seen as a possible future Russians dictator, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Mr. Zhirinovsky is a fascist. He came third in the Russian presidential election, with 6% of the vote. That gave him enough prominence to promote his views about the greatness of the Russian nation, the need for an authoritative central government and the benefits of state capitalism. Mr Zhirinovsky is also an imperialist who believes that ""the territories of the Baltic republics are native Russian lands"". He says he will wipe out Lithuania by dumping radioactive waste on its borders.
Neither the Reds nor the Browns are strong enough to mount a direct challenge to Mr Yeltsin's government. They might prove influential after a military coup. Even short of that, they pick up credibility by being part of a fluid right which embraces more scrupulous politicians who share some of their less dotty ideas.
Even some of Mr Yeltsin's methods do not always seem so different. Mr Zhirinovsky calls for a Russian dictator. Mr Yeltsin rules by decree, by-passes parliament, and last year vetoed local elections in order to appoint personal representatives as local governors. If mainstream political figures make themselves hard to distinguish from nationalist autocrats, ordinary voters in Russia may be tempted one day to accept a genuine dictator.
But, short of a military coup, the chances of this happening depend on popular discontent becoming so great that even fascism will seem preferable to economic reform. Yet discontent has not yet reached government-shaking proportions. Nearly two months after the introduction of huge price rises, there have been no food riots, only a few relatively small demonstrations, and no big strikes.
The authoritarian in Mr Yeltsin may yet steal the reactionaries' thunder. If economic conditions get so bad that people want an iron hand, then why not Mr Yeltsin's? Russian voters are no lumpenproletariat waiting for a dictator. Three times in the past three years they have had the chance to support chauvinists over democrats. So far, they have chosen not to."

On the insistence of Ireland's former prime minister, Charles Haughey, the European Community's legal draftsmen inserted a special protocol in the Maastricht treaty, due to be voted upon in a referendum in Ireland later this year. It said:
Nothing in the treaty on European Union or in the treaties establishing the European Communities or in the treaties or acts modifying or supplementing those treaties shall affect the application in Ireland of article 40.3.3 of the constitution of Ireland.
The article in question is Ireland's constitutional prohibition on abortion. In effect, the Irish government persuaded the EC to copper-fasten its anti-abortion law, so as to ensure that EC law could not be invoked at some point in the future to allow abortion in Ireland. The government believed that the protocol would help secure a safe passage for the Maastricht treaty in Ireland, heading off opposition from the Catholic Church and anti-abortion groups.
That strategy has backfired, because of a decision earlier this month by a Dublin High Court judge to prohibit a 14-year-old schoolgirl, pregnant as a result of an alleged rape, from travelling to London to have an abortion. The vote on the Maastricht treaty has now become a political timebomb.
In an opinion poll conducted after the row broke, 64% expressed opposition to the manner in which the force of the law had been brought against the girl. Two-thirds said they wanted reform of Ireland's strict anti-abortion laws. The girl appealed to the Irish Supreme Court. One of the grounds of the appeal was that Ireland's anti-abortion law should not overrule the EC's freedom-of-movement directives.
In a previous case heard before the European Court of Justice, the court upheld the Irish government's right to prohibit the dissemination in Ireland of information about procuring an abortion in Britain. But the EC advocate-general, Walter Van Gerven, remarked at that time that it would be ""disproportionate...to prevent pregnant women from going abroad"" to have an abortion.
The Irish Supreme Court has now concurred with the Van Gerven dictum, and struck down the nine-month travel restriction imposed on the child. It has yet to give its reasons, and these could still spell trouble for he Irish government and for Europe. A significant body of legal opinion in Dublin believes that the Maastricht protocol, if adopted as part of the treaty, would amount to a formal EC acceptance of the right to prohibit Irish citizens from travelling abroad to terminate pregnancies.
What this means is that future victims of rape or incest could be prevented from having resulting pregnancies terminated by force of European, not just Irish, law. The Maastricht referendum, instead of being about greater economic and political interaction, would--in Ireland--be about abortion. And if humanitarian concerns for the victims of such crimes led a majority to vote against the Maastricht treaty, then the entire treaty would fall.
The Irish government could seek to have an amendment made to its Maastricht protocol in advance, though this is without precedent in EC history. It could also prove awkward elsewhere: abortion is a controversial issue in other states (such as Germany and Belgium). Other groups could see an opportunity to press for other unrelated amendments to the treaty.
It is an enormous mess. The girl's appeal to the Supreme Court was backed by a hue groundswell of liberal opinion. Thousands have marched in the streets of Dublin demanding reform. The five Supreme Court judges have a reputation for interpreting Irish law in a liberal way. The embarrassed government of Albert Reynolds had been hoping against hope that they would let the girl travel to Britain for an abortion. It now hopes they will base their decision on her rights in Irish law. By opposing the High Court ruling on the basis of(temporary) EC guaranteed freedoms, they would merely put off the fight. Maastricht may yet be remembered in Ireland as a battleground, not a treaty."

Yet this year many people in the south-east, where Turkey touches Iraq and Iran, are awaiting the thaw with dread. They fear that the eight-year-long war between the Turkish security forces and the guerrillas--""terrorists"", to most Turks--of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) is coming to a head. Certainly, the military men in the region seem to be making preparations for a big fight.
The number of people killed in this guerrilla war, on both sides, went up sharply last year, partly because the PKK could lay its hands on large quantities of weapons abandoned by the Iraqi army in the Kurdish area of next-door Iraq. The Turkish armed forces seem to think that escalation must be met by escalation. The chief of staff promises a spring crackdown on the guerrillas. Fresh troops have been arriving at the railway station in Diyarbakir, the south-east's main city.
Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, alarmed by fears of a ""Nevruz nightmare"", promised this week that the fight against the PKK will be kept within the confines of the law. He has repeatedly said that the problems of the south-east cannot be solved by force alone; they also need the power of ""affection"". Many of the Kurds of the poverty-stricken south-east would argue that they see no sign of that. They believe the government has little control over the security forces in this part of the country. The soldiers and policemen trying to put down the Kurdish insurrection can, it is claimed, arrest people, beat them and even kill them with impunity.
Fehmi Gumus, the head of the bar association in Diyarbakir, says that at any given time about 1,000 people are under detention, and almost all of them suffer torture of one kind or another. This month, within a week of each other, two journalists writing for radical publications have been shot dead. One story says they were victims of the conservative wrath of a mysterious group of Muslim fundamentalists. The other, more popular, rumour points to a secret security unit. One of the two, a 24-year-old reporter with the newspaper Ulke, is said to have been seized and threatened by gendarmes not long before his death.
The president of Turkey's parliament, Husamettin Cindoruk, sees the violence in the south-east as only one aspect of the need to improve civil rights throughout the country. He has urged the government to keep its promise to let arrested people have a lawyer present while they are interrogated, and to yield to habeas corpus demands within 48 hours of a suspect's arrest.
Others take a bleaker view of what is going on. Aydin Gurkhan, of the Social Democrats, the junior partners in Mr Demirel's coalition, believes that ""dark forces"" are exploiting the Kurdish problem. He expects more acts of terrorism as Nevruz approaches. There is also a curse-on-both-houses school. ""The PKK and the security forces...are on the same non-democratic side,"" says Murat Belge, who has led a delegation of worried liberals to look around the south-east.
The government has relaxed a bit. Turkey's Kurds are freer to express themselves in their own language than they used to be. The Social Democrats, now in the government, contain a sizeable group of Kurds. But the fight is so bitter that such nuances of improvement may no loner count for much. This week parliament agreed to extend the state of emergency in the south-east. Come the spring, the Kurdish problem seems set to get worse."

They are not afraid to say, ""I don't know."" Their open-mindedness extends to money. The original estimate of the first year's cost of keeping nearly 14,000 troops in three Serb-occupied enclaves of Croatia was $400m. After talks with the Yugoslavs, who spied a chance to draw dollars into their war-torn economy, the bill jumped to $635m.
The Security Council choked. It must soon dun UN members for the Cambodia venture as well (see page 37). The Russians are broke. The Americans, who pay 30% of peacekeeping operations, asked why the UN should pay $120m for housing troops when barracks and even hotels were empty. The secretariat was told to make the Yugoslavs, who caused the trouble, contribute more housing, lorries and jeeps. The figure was soon dropping back to around $400m. It may be reviewed at the end of the year.
Getting a large force drawn from many countries to the enclaves is the big transport problem. Once there, military men say, the terrain is manageable. When roads, railways and bridges are repaired, moving about should be easy. An advance party is due to begin sorting these things out soon. The main body of troops should start arriving
The plan is for small UN teams to man 24-hour checkpoints scattered through the enclaves. Their job is to disarm the militias and supervise the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army. Neither task is simple. Disgruntled gunmen trying to ""liberate"" territory may shoot at them. Some Yugoslav officers could refuse to pull out. The omens, all the same, are good. Neither the Croats, the Serbs nor the generals want more war.
Important details still need to be settled. Two of the UN Protected Areas--Krajina and Eastern Slavonia--are well defined. In Western Slavonia, where battle lines were fluid, boundaries must be agreed on.
Perhaps the toughest issue is what happens inside the enclaves. Local, that is Serbian, authorities will remain until a final settlement. The Croats, however, want their law to apply. Nobody, after all, disputes that the enclaves are currently part of Croatia. The UN plan leaves an awkward way for Croats to assert their authority. The local police forces are supposed to reflect the ethnic make-up of the towns and villages before the war. As some of these had Croat majorities, there is the following bizarre possibility: provisional Serb town councils giving orders to Croat policemen keeping an eye on Serbs in once Croat villages within a Serb enclave patrolled by the UN. Nobody said it would be easy.
If the peacekeepers are not to become a semi-permanent fixture, like the UN troops in Cyprus, now in their 28th year, a peace agreement must be made. Lord Carrington, the European Community's negotiator, was back in Yugoslavia at the end of February to see how best to restart talks. Feared Serb objections to further EC diplomacy after Germany's successful push for European recognition have not, it seems, materialised. The issue is more whether shuttle diplomacy would not be better, to start with, than a full-dress conference.
Any peace must be ingenious. It must hold to the rule that borders cannot be altered by force. That implies that the Serb enclaves are to remain in Croatia, except for any small bits of them negotiated away. This would be a victory for Croatia, whose leaders want back every square inch they have lost, though an empty one for Croats who have left the Serb enclaves, probably never to return.
An agreement will also have to satisfy Serbia that Serbs in the enclaves have not only believable guarantees against discrimination from Croats but some sort of self-rule. Getting less than that would mean almost total failure for the Serbs in a costly and, to most outsiders, pointless war.
The conflicting demands might be made easier to solve if Serbian and Croatian bits were to be carved out of neighbouring Bosnia & Herceovina. But that would violate a third constraint: respecting the integrity of Yugoslavia's other republics. The peacemakers will have to be conjurers."

But for the past 100 days, political leaders of Belgium's two communities have looked more like headless chickens as they have scrambled to form a new government. Deliverance may be in sight.
It comes in the burly form of Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Christian Democratic minister of communications in the outgoing government, whose collapse precipitated early elections last November. Mr Dehaene is Belgium's political fixer. He was instrumental in putting together the previous government of Christian Democrats and Socialists in 1987, headed by Wilfried Martens.
Mr Dehaene is now negotiating the formation of a similar coalition, consisting of the Flemish Christian Democrats and Socialists and their sister parties from the French-speaking part of the country. This does not reflect a lack of imagination on his part; it is a sign of desperation. For the past three months political leaders have tried every other imaginable coalition formula without success.
The chief obstacle has been the need to form a government with a two-thirds majority in the 212-seat lower house of parliament in order to continue the process of turning Belgium into a fully federal state. But the main opposition Liberals, or at least their Flemish half, refused to join a coalition with Socialists in it. The Greens, who did well in the election, do not want to be mere lobby fodder for the traditional parties, and anyway their 17 MPs still would not give the government a two-thirds majority. No party will work with the racist Vlaams Blok, the other minor party to do well in the election.
Mr Dehaene is putting back together the government for which voters showed their distaste in November by lopping off 14 of their 134 seats in parliament. But Mr Martens is not expected to return as prime minister. He may become foreign minister.
Names of possible prime ministers, besides Mr Dehaene himself, include Willy Claes, a Flemish Socialist and outgoing minister for economic affairs, and Melchior Wathelet, a French-speaking Christian Democrat and minister of justice under Mr Martens. Mr Wathelet is the only Walloon politician who speaks Dutch well enough to be acceptable to the Flemings. All leading Flemish politicians also speak French.
Although a centre-left coalition still falls well short of a two-thirds majority, Mr Dehaene hopes it will be able to count on support from Liberals, Greens and the moderate Flemish nationalists of the Volksunie for items of federalist legislation. This is by no means a foregone conclusion.
The only alternative to reviving the coalition would have been new elections. This would probably have led to the traditional parties, particularly Mr Dehaene's, being further mauled by the Greens, racists and other non-conformists who scooped up the protest vote in November.
As in other countries where central governments are weak, economic life has continued unaffected by the 100-day fit of hiccups. The Belgian franc is still the strongest in the EC's exchange-rate mechanism. Belgian inflation has fallen in each of the past three months and now stands at 2.26%. But this tells only part of the story. The country needs a period of budgetary discipline if it is to meet the target set for joining the final stage of the EC'S economic and monetary union by 1997. Otherwise its chickens, headless or not, will come home to roost."

They showed their happiness on February 22nd in a distinctly restrained way, by re-electing the party of the outgoing government with a pretty modest majority. Eddie Fenech Adami and his Nationalists start their second term with a margin of 51.8% of the votes to Labour's 46.5%, and a majority in parliament of only three seats.
""People will remember what Malta went through"" during the two decades of Labour rule, Mr Fenech Adami had predicted during the campaign. He did his best to make sure they did. Newspaper advertisements saying ""Never again"" showed mugshots of policemen accused of torture during the Labour years (1971-87). Voters were told that corruption had flourished under Dom Mintoff and his successor as Labour leader, Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici.
Otherwise the election had an un-Maltese quietness. This is testimony to Mr Fenech Adami's efforts at national reconciliation. A new environmental pressure group, Alternativa Demokratika, got some support, especially from first-time voters, that might otherwise have gone to the Nationalists. But Labour is still backed by many Maltese. Family voting loyalties leave little room for the floating voter.
Mr Fenech Adami hopes that Maltese democracy can be safeguarded by closer ties to the European Community, which Malta applied to join two years ago. His party argues that, after 28 years of independence from Britain, Malta can win benefits from EC membership without losing its sense of identity. Labour retorts that the government can have little faith in the people if it must look elsewhere to safeguard democracy. Anyway, it observes, Malta has always been part of Europe: why, it was home to the Knights of St John for almost 300 years.
Partly to smooth a path to the EC, the Nationalists spent their first term extricating the economy from Labour's strict controls and its policy of import-substitution. The result is a flourishing private sector. Private enterprise now provides more than 84% of all new jobs. Investment tripled in the three years to 1990.
The EC already accounts for three-quarters of Malta's imports and exports. But full membership will not come soon: other countries come higher in the queue. An agreement roughly along the lines of the European Economic Area, which will link the EC and the European Free Trade Association, might help Malta to get ready for full membership, which the island's employers' federation admits will be no joy-ride.
For its part, the government will continue to encourage foreign investment. Maltese productivity is enticingly competitive. The island can make much of its history as a trading post between Europe and the Arab world. The newly developed free port handles about 4,000 containers a week.
Just before polling day the government inaugurated several big infrastructure projects. One is a new airport terminal, which Labour called a ""luxury"". But, with 25% of GDP based on tourism, the government says the investment is justified. One writer once described his arrival in the old one as ""passing through the gates of hell to enter paradise""."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136739/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/29?accountid=14657,"Might Romania at last be ready for a second, democratic, revolution? Ever since the overthrow of the hated a Ceausescu regime in 1989, opposition politicians have accused the former Communists of the governing National Salvation Front of stealing the first revolution. Now their showing in local elections suggests that the opposition umbrella organisation, the Convention for Democracy, has a chance of bringing down the Front at the general election due to be held in May or June.
Two years ago the Front scooped up 66% of the vote. Now it is crumbling. It has long been split between former Communists, who want to slow the pace of change and who argue for continued state intervention in the economy, and reformers who want to move Romania quickly towards a market economy. The reformers accuse the old guard of wanton to preserve the privileges they enjoyed under the old regime.
The Front's divisions are deepest at the top. Although officially no longer in the party, the Front's founder and Romania's president, Ion Iliescu, is the standard-bearer of the old guard. After the Front came to power he appointed Petre Roman as prime minister. Mr Roman promptly embarked on market reforms which deepened the split between the old guard and the new. Open warfare broke out last October, when Mr Iliescu used the occasion of miners' riots in Bucharest to sack Mr Roman as prime minister (he is now party leader). His replacement, Theodor Stolojan, has been no more successful at perking up the economy. While the Front flounders, Romanians blame it for the economic hardship and for the failure of reform.
All that helps the opposition. But the opposition is also helping itself. Badly divided at the 1990 election, the new Convention for Democracy seems to be holding together remarkably well, considering the odd mix of parties. The Convention is dominated by four groups: two parties of pre-war vintage (the Liberal Party and the Peasants' Party), the ethnic Hungarian Union of Democratic Magyars, and a civil-rights group called Civic Alliance. Their leaders claim to be united by the fight to establish a real democracy. ""Getting rid of the Communists is the first necessity,"" says Corneliu Coposu, the leader of the Peasants' Party.
Beyond that, little has been decided. A general election is being called because Romania's first post-Ceausescu parliament has completed its job: to write a new constitution. This gives wide powers to the president, and will therefore be the envy of Poland's Lech Walesa and Czechoslovakia's Vaclav Havel, both of whom fret at the difficulty of getting reforms through parliament. But Romania's opposition politicians have condemned the idea of a strong presidency. The Convention promises that it will make changes to the constitution if it wins the general election.
Its chances have been improved by a good showing in local elections. The second round of these took place on February 22nd. Though the old guard did well in the countryside, the Convention notched up a series of impressive successes in Romania's largest cities, including Bucharest, the capital, and Timisoara, the birthplace of the anti-Ceausescu revolution. This could be a mortal blow to the ailing National Salvation Front."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224154707/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/30?accountid=14657,"It is too late for the chancellor, Norman Lamont, to use his budget to revive the economy before the election, but he still has time to bribe the voters. He also has a national platform from which to stress the differences between his party's tax plans and Labour's.
In March 1990 the Treasury pencilled in a balanced budget for the fiscal year 1992-93 (starting this April). The recession and the Tories' pre-election promises on spending have put paid to any such idea. Most City brokers are now expecting the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) to rise from an estimated L11.5 billion ($20 billion) in 1991-92 to at least L20 billion in 1992-93 (3% of GDP), even before any tax cuts that maybe coming along in the budget. As recently as 1988-89, the government had a surplus (ie, it repaid debt) of no less than L14.7 billion.
Last autumn most City economists reckoned that Mr Lamont would have no room for vote-winning tax cuts in his second budget. Just a few months later, the City seems happy about a tax ""give-away"" of up to L4 billion. The reason for this change of heart, say the cynics, is that the City accepts such slackness as the price of a Conservative victory at the polls. But some superficially respectable arguments are being floated. Expect Mr Lamont to use them.
First, membership of the European exchange-rate mechanism restricts Britain's interest-rate policy and so, it is argued, fiscal policy--ie, old-fashioned fine-tuning--needs to play a bigger role. Second, the recession has turned out to be much worse than expected. Output fell again in the fourth quarter of last year, to give a total fall in non-oil GDP of 3.9% from its peak in mid-1990. This makes it the longest recession since the war, though not the deepest. (In 1980-81 non-oil GDP fell by 6.1% from peak to trough.) The Treasury's forecast last November of 2-1/4% growth in 1992 now looks far too rosy. The dozen private-sector economists polled by The Economist every month have cut their average forecast for growth this year to just 1.4%.
The third argument used in favour of a stimulus is that the Maastricht treaty for European monetary union set two criteria for whether a budget deficit was ""excessive"". It should be no more than 3% of GDP; and public debt should be no more than 60% of GDP. By this test, Britain's fiscal finances look relatively sound:
* Britain's budget deficit of 1.9% of GDP in 1991 (using a comparable definition) was one of the lowest in the EC (see chart). (Chart omitted) Assuming tax cuts of about L2 billion-3 billion in the budget, the PSBR could rise in fiscal 1992 to around 3-1/2% of GDP (L23 billion). Though that would breach the Maastricht rule, it would still be below the EC average of 4.3%, even though Britain has by far the deepest recession in the EC. Note, however, that the PSBR excluding privatisation receipts could reach (30 billion (4.6% of GDP).
* Britain's public debt is only 44% of GDP, well below the EC average of 62%.
These three arguments may help to justify the level of 1992-93's PSBR as now officially projected, but not a further stimulus. Last November's autumn statement increased public spending for 1992-93 by L8 billion, of which only (5 billion can be blamed on the recession. Although everybody will concentrate on the tax cuts on March 10th, the total stimulus will really be much larger--and hence more risky.
Mr Lamont is only too aware of the longer-term risks, but he also knows that it is his job to win the election. Most pundits are therefore tipping a cut in the basic rate of income tax by ip in the pound. This would cost L2 billion. The Labour Party says it will reverse such a cut if elected. If the election is on April 9th, the tax cut would not yet have been implemented, so voters would be facing a straight choice on whether or not they wanted it. No prizes for guessing how many would vote, especially those on above average earnings in the south-east, who would enjoy the biggest tax savings.
Another popular tip is a cut in the uniform business rate to help lots of small businesses. Trimming 10% off next year's bills would cost about L1.5 billion.
No doubt Mr Lamont will be keen to offset these revenue losses to some extent. He could freeze the married-couple allowance and the threshold for the higher rate of tax; or he could raise excise duties by more than the rate of inflation. The election, if held on April 9th, would be out of the way before this pushed up the published inflation rate.
Ministers now say the cabinet was divided when discussing the political value of income-tax cuts, with John Major and his more ""political"" allies trying to erode a wall of caution from the Treasury. Mr Lamont himself has been less enthusiastic about the salesmanship side of his job than the prime minister, and this has caused mild tensions in the past. The case for income-tax cuts has been undermined, too, by the way they have been so widely trailed in recent weeks, giving Labour a chance to paint Mr Major's strategy as crude pre-election bribery (see Bagehot, page 70). (Article omitted)
Another, lesser, problem for the government comes from the Thatcherite old-guard, who have been expressing private apprehension at the scale of expected government borrowing. The intense clubbiness of the party in a pre-election period means that Mr Major can probably rely on right-wing criticism remaining muted. But if the Conservatives lose the election, it will erupt. If they win, it will be stored up as evidence by those fearful of a takeover of the administration by Michael Heseltine and his highspending allies in high places."

As the financial year draws to its close, managers start to run out of money, senior doctors write despairing letters to the broadsheets, and the tabloids dig up stories of botched operations and life-threatening delays.
A month or so of that seasonal fare may be all the opposition needs to nudge the Tories out of office. Labour is trying to make as much noise on health as possible. Robin Cook, its health spokesman, has spent the past fortnight launching policy documents and exposing what he says are scandals. He promises to hold a spinechilling press conference every week from now until the election.
The Tories naturally favour silence. Cabinet ministers are so worried that the issue will recapture public attention that they have even stopped William Waidegrave, the health secretary, from publishing a bland white paper on healthy living that was to have appeared in the next few weeks. So far, the silence-is-best strategy has worked rather well. The problems of the NHS have failed to fire the popular imagination.
Why? Because those problems are being fixed, says the government--thanks to its NHS reforms. Revitalised by the internal market and guided by prudent management, the NHS iS improving its services and cutting waiting lists. The opposition blames more traditional political arts: bribery and propaganda. To ensure its reelection, Mr Cook says, the government is massaging the news and burying potential problems under mounds of cash. Both sides are right.
The prospect of a general election has persuaded Treasury ministers to be unusually generous to the NHS. In 1989-90 the NHS had to make do with growth in real spending of less than 1%. In 1990-91 its real increase was 2.4%. The increase for 1991-92 is likely to be bigger still. Scarcely a week goes by without Mr Waldegrave announcing a cash bonus for some deserving cause or other. Helping people who caught HIV as a result of NHS treatment will cost about L12m ($21m). Financing the generous pay rises recommended by the pay-review body--doctors will get an extra 6% and nurses an extra 5.8%--will cost L149m.
Mr Waldegrave is being particularly generous to those notorious vote-losers, cash-strapped hospitals and long waiting lists. Health authorities are now digging into their reserves to stave off liquidity squeezes and ward closures. At the beginning of the financial year Duncan Nichol, the NHS chief executive, instructed health authorities to hold back between 1/2% and 1% of their incomes for use in emergencies. Now they are spending it.
Hospitals are also being worked flat out to make sure the government honours its pledge on waiting-lists--ie, that no list after March will include anyone who has had to wait more than two years for an operation. So far, so good (see chart). (Chart omitted) Mr Waidegrave has conjured up an extra L4m since early December, to add to the L36m he had already set aside for cutting waiting lists in 1991-92. He has also promised a further L39m for a waiting-list blitz in 1992-93.
To see that the money is well spent , the health secretary has drafted in a manager, Anthony McKeever, who made his reputation by slashing waiting-lists on Merseyside. The word in the health service is that the department is determined to cut the two-year waiting list virtually regardless of cost. NHS hospitals are now so busy treating the backlog of patients that Mr McKeever is thinking of handing out contracts to military hospitals and the private sector.
The DOH has also mastered the art of news management. A confidential memorandum on regional finance dated January 27th and subsequently leaked to the Labour Party suggests that the NHS's top executives are devoting almost as much thought to paparazzi as they are to patients. The document is full of references to ""hot spots"" and ""minimising noise"".
Thought-control by the NHS's top management and dollops of cash from the centre are not quite what reformers had in mind when they advocated restructuring the NHS. But the internal market itself is also doing its bit to save the government from embarrassment. Much to Labour's dismay, a growing number of doctors are being won over.
A MOMENTUM FOR CHANGE
Put part of this down to the profession's innate conservatism: doctors are loth to see a Labour government starting another period of upheaval. Self-interest is also a factor: GP fundholders and opted-out hospitals are determined to defend their new-found privileges. But it is true, too, that the reforms are beginning to deliver what was promised of them.
One sign of this is that academic researchers are popping up all over the place to assert, in tones of studied surprise, that the internal market has its merits. For instance, a recent study of GP fund-holders, commissioned by the King's Fund, an independent think-tank, demonstrated that GP fundholders are indeed improving their services--without resorting to queue-jumping.
The Labour Party, meanwhile, is caught in a dilemma. How can it point out that the government is throwing money at the NHS, when it has spent five years accusing the Tories of starving the service of cash? How can it argue that Mr Waldegrave is indulging in the worst sort of Whitehall-based micromanagement, when it has based its campaign on the canard that he is privatising the health service?
Nor is Labour likely to make many fresh converts with its new policy document, released on February 20th after months of head-scratching. Its proposals amount, in effect, to increasing the power of Whitehall's bureaucrats and offering bribes to trade-union interests within the NHS. Neither device would do much to improve the allocation of resources or to avert the financial pressures on the NHS.
Perhaps the man the Tories should fear most is not Mr Cook but their own chancellor, Norman Lamont. For all the Treasury's sudden generosity, a tax-cutting budget would allow Mr Cook to accuse the Tories of short-changing the NHS in order to buy taxpayer votes. It would also give Mr Cook an easy explanation of how he would pay for Labour's promises on health: by not cutting taxes, of course."

Hospitals are also being worked flat out to make sure the government honours its pledge on waiting-lists--ie, that no list after March will include anyone who has had to wait more than two years for an operation. So far, so good (see chart). (Chart omitted) Mr Waidegrave has conjured up an extra L4m since early December, to add to the L36m he had already set aside for cutting waiting lists in 1991-92. He has also promised a further L39m for a waiting-list blitz in 1992-93.
To see that the money is well spent , the health secretary has drafted in a manager, Anthony McKeever, who made his reputation by slashing waiting-lists on Merseyside. The word in the health service is that the department is determined to cut the two-year waiting list virtually regardless of cost. NHS hospitals are now so busy treating the backlog of patients that Mr McKeever is thinking of handing out contracts to military hospitals and the private sector.
The DOH has also mastered the art of news management. A confidential memorandum on regional finance dated January 27th and subsequently leaked to the Labour Party suggests that the NHS's top executives are devoting almost as much thought to paparazzi as they are to patients. The document is full of references to ""hot spots"" and ""minimising noise"".
Thought-control by the NHS's top management and dollops of cash from the centre are not quite what reformers had in mind when they advocated restructuring the NHS. But the internal market itself is also doing its bit to save the government from embarrassment. Much to Labour's dismay, a growing number of doctors are being won over.
A MOMENTUM FOR CHANGE
Put part of this down to the profession's innate conservatism: doctors are loth to see a Labour government starting another period of upheaval. Self-interest is also a factor: GP fundholders and opted-out hospitals are determined to defend their new-found privileges. But it is true, too, that the reforms are beginning to deliver what was promised of them.
One sign of this is that academic researchers are popping up all over the place to assert, in tones of studied surprise, that the internal market has its merits. For instance, a recent study of GP fund-holders, commissioned by the King's Fund, an independent think-tank, demonstrated that GP fundholders are indeed improving their services--without resorting to queue-jumping.
The Labour Party, meanwhile, is caught in a dilemma. How can it point out that the government is throwing money at the NHS, when it has spent five years accusing the Tories of starving the service of cash? How can it argue that Mr Waldegrave is indulging in the worst sort of Whitehall-based micromanagement, when it has based its campaign on the canard that he is privatising the health service?
Nor is Labour likely to make many fresh converts with its new policy document, released on February 20th after months of head-scratching. Its proposals amount, in effect, to increasing the power of Whitehall's bureaucrats and offering bribes to trade-union interests within the NHS. Neither device would do much to improve the allocation of resources or to avert the financial pressures on the NHS.
Perhaps the man the Tories should fear most is not Mr Cook but their own chancellor, Norman Lamont. For all the Treasury's sudden generosity, a tax-cutting budget would allow Mr Cook to accuse the Tories of short-changing the NHS in order to buy taxpayer votes. It would also give Mr Cook an easy explanation of how he would pay for Labour's promises on health: by not cutting taxes, of course."

Those of a sanguine bent usually discern the same sign: Sinn Fein, they say, is clearly hinting at a break with the murderous tactics of the IRA--a sure reflection of popular disaffection with the gunmen.
Sinn Fein itself is always ready to encourage the speculation, with declarations that it should not be taken to speak for the IRA and does not advocate violence. But these are empty words, uttered for the sake of legal convenience--the party operates openly in the province--and to gather whatever propaganda points are going.
The reality is different. Distinctions between the political and military wings of Irish republicanism are for the outside world to make; when republicans are gathered together, their common purpose--to force Britain's withdrawal from the island--is seldom far from the surface. Nowhere is this more evident to outsiders than at Sinn Fein's annual conference, held this year in the community hall of Ballyfermot, a downtrodden suburb of Dublin.
Perhaps the conference's setting helped to produce even more of a sense of shared oppression than usual. It has assembled in recent years in central Dublin's Mansion House, an imposing building dear to republicans because it housed the first assembly of the independent Irish parliament in 1919. But this year Dublin councillors voted to eject them, acknowledging the intense dislike in the Irish republic for the IRA. So in speech after speech, the republicans laboured to turn their exile to Ballyfermot into a bade of incorruptibility--another example of the ""marginalisation and demonisation"" that republicans must expect from Irish ""collaborators"".
There was the traditional applause for visitors recently released from prison for IRA activities, and Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, made his annual assertion of ""the right to armed struggle"". Another leading figure, Martin McGuinness, said the government was ""sadly mistaken"" if it thought Sinn Fein could be ""corralled"" into condemning the IRA.
In the week before the conference, four IRA men (the oldest of them was just 22) were killed in an ambush by undercover soldiers at Coalisland, in rural mid-Ulster. The four had just attacked a fortified police station with a machine-gun bolted to a lorry. Catholic clerics condemned the attack--and they also condemned those who dispatch young men on such suicidal missions. They pit the tactics of the 1920s against a high-tech modern army, said one priest.
This counted for less in Ballyfermot, though, than reports of the local population's response to the Coalisland deaths. Teenagers queued to carry the dead men's coffins at funerals swamped by police in riot gear. The squalor of their deaths was quickly transmuted into a romantic act of heroism. The romance may be a fiction; the supply of young recruits for the IRA is not. Two of the ambushed IRA unit apparently escaped the army: one was 17 years old.
His dead associates took their place at Ballyfermot among the names of those killed over the past 12 months. The ""martyrs"" included Sinn Fein councillors murdered by Protestant Loyalist gunmen and party workers shot dead by a deranged policeman in West Belfast earlier this year, as well as IRA activists killed by the police or the army. All their photographs hung on the walls of the hall; they made up ""a gallery of patriotic heroes"", said one leading speaker.
His rhetoric caught the mood rather better than the passing assertions from the Sinn Fein leadership that the party is holding firm at the polls. It is true that Sinn Fein's vote has held steady in recent council elections in Northern Ireland. But the ballot box counts for little in republican circles these days. The party has abandoned the idea of building a base in the Irish republic.
So the republican focus is unchanged: the wider political scene is seen only in terms of how it advances or sets back the one true republican aim. Mr Adams praised the movement's latest ""peace plan"" as a significant development. As ever, though, it asserts that Irish woes are entirely the result of the British partition of the island.
The collapsed peace talks initiated by the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Brooke, were dismissed by Mr Adams as ""a bad soap opera"" because they did not address partition. The British and Irish governments, he said, should jointly adopt a policy of ending partition and should work with both the nationalists and Unionists of the North to effect ""national reconciliation."" True to form, no one asked any questions about the cold-blooded killing by the IRA of Protestant workmen, or about the effect this might be expected to have on the attitudes of those nationalists and Unionists and their chances of working with each other in the future."

""it would hurt for me to drive it into a neighbourhood where people were having a hard time."" She settled for a humble Range Rover.
The world's most famous luxury-car maker, it seems, may have run into a snag: could riding in a Roller require just too thick a skin? If so, nemesis could threaten for Rolls-Royce and its cars with the flying lady mascot on their radiator grills. Thing certainly look ominous in the showrooms. On February 24th it announced that after decades of bumper profits, worldwide sales slumped from 3,333 in 1990 to just 1,723 last year--their lowest level since 1968. The collapse helped to drag Vickers, the British engineering group that owns the car maker, into a L12.4m ($22m)loss.
Vickers blames a deep recession for the slump in sales, especially in the company's two main markets--Britain and America. It is, after all, hard for a company chairman to justify splashing out L93,000 for one of the cheapest models--a Rolls Royce Silver Spirit, rated by Britain's Car magazine as a ""glorious artefact""--while handing out redundancy notices. Even the British ambassador to the United Nations is now to be seen not in a Rolls but a Lincoln (made by America's Ford).
Rolls-Royce has slashed its workforce, mostly based at Crewe, to just over 3,000. It has also closed its North London coachbuilder, Mulliner Park Ward, which made the stately Rolls-Royce Phantoms, complete with walnut picnic tables and solid-silver fruit bowls. Despite these cuts, Rolls-Royce's future is far from secure. To help pay for developing new models, Vickers is seeking a partner. Without one, it may decide to sell the company altogether.
Trade gossip has BMW as the most likely bidder, though the German car maker has denied any negotiations are taking place. Vickers may be asking too much money. BMW's boss, Eberhard von Kuenheim, has said he is concerned about the ""social acceptance of such a car."" Germany's car makers have already drawn plenty of flak for making so many big, expensive cars for a greening, more energy-conscious world.
Car sales revolve around branding as much as engine performance. Rolls-Royce has kept its image highly polished. Officials privately winced when John Lennon painted his Rolls-Royce Phantom in psychedelic colours or when Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, a mystic, ordered yet another Rolls-Royce to add to his collection, which eventually numbered more than 90. Perhaps they were right to worry. Wider Roller-ownership may have cost the brand much of its former exclusiveness, and replaced it with a lethal whiff of vulgarity.
Compelled to rely more on the intrinsic worth of the product, in terms of value for money, the car's salesmen have an even tougher problem. A luxury Japanese car can now do everything a Rolls-Royce can--at a quarter of the price. The image of a Rolls-Royce as a state-of-the-art car is becoming harder and more expensive to sustain. It may be that Rolls-Royce will have to embrace the nostalgia business, making models that are resolutely of a different era, to keep its famous flying lady on the road."

The latest, though, deserves noting: whereas only a few weeks ago Labour's shadow ministers were depressed, most of them now think they will be in government within a few weeks. One summed up the mood: ""Neil is actually going to do it. I'm not sure I ever really believed that before.""
Why this collective rush of blood to the head? Neither Labour's health-policy relaunch nor its education agenda has exactly set the nation alight. And though recent polls have put Labour just ahead, the parties remain remarkably close. Partly, Labour's cheeriness is an over-reaction to its dismal January. But. its better poll-ratings have come at a time when John Major and his team seem less than surefooted. Important white papers have been delayed. Nobody quite knows what to say about the recession. The hottest gossip is about who would replace a defeated Mr Major--not, for once, a defeated Mr Kinnock.
February has proved to be Labour's month, as Tory planners rather suspected it would be. On ""Black Thursday"", February 13th, unemployment figures rose for the 22nd consecutive month, to 2.67m, and home repossessions and mortgage arrears reached record levels. Just to add to Britons' cheer, ministers announced that prescription charges would be raised by more than 10%. A week later, figures showing that the economy had shrunk by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 1991 confirmed that Britain was in the longest recession since the second world war.
All that was bad enough. But Labour was cheered as much by an interview Mr Major gave to the Daily Telegraph in which he seemed relaxed about letting government debt soar. Asked about borrowing for tax cuts, he said that running a deficit was wise so long as it could return to equilibrium within a reasonable number of years: ""It is a prudent way to run the economy, providing we do not think we can go on a Rake's Progress for an indefinite period."" Even the language was awkward, suggesting that a Rake's Progress could be dandy for a carefully defined interval.
Labour interpreted that as a straightforward hint that tax cuts would be financed by sharply increased borrowing. Using the kind of heroic assumptions the Tories employ to dissect his own plans, the shadow chancellor, John Smith, estimated a borrowing gap over the next few years of around L33 billion ($57 billion). In the Commons, Mr Kinnock attacked Mr Major for trying to bribe his way back to power--and Mr Major's defensive response hardly sounded like a denial. Even some senior Tory MPs were asking whether the government had fluffed its message and been too blatantly political over its tax-cutting strategy. One Labour MP said: ""They have been playing their cards too early and too obviously.""
All of which points suspicious souls towards an unexpectedly cautious budget--not government by blunder, but government by feint. Possibly. But a timid budget would run the risk of sinking without leaving any trace in the polls. The Tories need momentum. So far they have cleverly used Commons statements on matters of dubious news-value to keep ahead on the television bulletins. They are unlikely to ignore the impact of the first pre-election budget to be televised. One Tory planner describes the budget as ""our touch-paper"". The view at Central Office is that the punters will cheer, and spend their tax cuts within hours.
PLENTY TO PONDER
Where does that leave Labour? So long as he is in opposition, Mr Smith can be relied on to express astonishment at any income-tax cuts in the budget; in his most censorious Presbyterian tones, he will admonish the chancellor for cutting the Treasury's tax revenues just as the country is crying out for a more generous spending programme.
In government, however, Mr Smith could face a dilemma. Labour is already committed to being generous on several fronts, with higher pensions and child benefits at the top of the list. Would Mr Smith want to raise taxes to pay for these promises? Or would he hope that the continuing recession could justify even higher borrowing than the Tories were planning--sweeping aside the little matter of his own stance in opposition?
The Labour Treasury team might hope to be able to delay their current plan to scrap the earnings ceiling for national-insurance contributions. This has already proved politically embarrassing. It might be politically convenient for Mr Smith to be able to point to the Tories' earlier tolerance of a higher borrowing requirement. Whatever his intentions, Mr Smith must prepare his shadow budget with great care. It will end recent jibes from some of his fraternal colleagues about his not being as clever as he thinks; or will amplify them. For the moment, the fixers in the Parliamentary Labour Party still regard him as the next leader, should the par be defeated.
But being a shadow anything is far less exciting than being a real chancellor, or a real minister. For a clutch of Labourites, including Mr Smith, Gerald Kaufman, Roy Hattersley and of course Mr Kinnock himself, this will be their last chance. Their excitement about being close to success is easy to understand.
And mood matters: the danger for Mr Major is that Labour now starts to act and sound like a party of winners, while the Conservatives lose their nerve. Already, junior members of the government have been muttering about a contingency plan for a June poll. This would irritate--perhaps infuriate--millions of voters who may already be bored witless with the campaigning: all the nods and winks from Whitehall are still pointing to an April 9th poll. But nothing is certain until Mr Major makes his move. Will he be ready to do so in a couple of weeks, if the party's private polling tells him he is heading for defeat?
It does not tell him that, yet; only that he is sailing into the unknown. The budget will set the course, and then much will depend on whether voters are in a terminal grump with the Conservatives or just a passing sulk. That question is one neither the polls nor history can answer. For all the comparisons being flung about--1950; 1964; 1979--this contest will be like no previous election. This is good news, at least, for the pundits. Uncharted waters can be dangerous, but rarely dull."

No matter how large media companies become, changes in strategy usually mean new faces (as Mr Yetnikoff himself discovered when Sony fired him). Now two of America's most powerful media men have resigned: Barry Diller, the chairman of Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation; and Nick Nicholas, the co-chief executive of Time Warner, the world's biggest media company, which is run by Steven Ross.
Behind the abrupt departures of ""Nick the knife"" and ""Killer Diller"" are the melodramas Hollywood loves. Mr Nicholas's job has gone to Gerald Levin, a rival at Time for two decades. Mr Diller, the most versatile of Hollywood's bosses, founded the Fox television network and revitalised its studio. Last year one of Fox's films, ""Home Alone"", helped keep Mr Murdoch's indebted empire afloat. Now Mr Diller is out.
The resignations could have a domino effect, starting a fresh round of deals and mergers among America's media companies. Unfortunately, the rationale for such deals is likely to be the same old belief that bigger is better, a strategy which has yet to bring any company much benefit.
Of the two resignations, Mr Diller's on February 24th was the more surprising. Despite rumours that he was ousted, Mr Diller insists that he is leaving because, after making fortunes for employers at Paramount, ABC and Fox, he wants to own his own business. Some friends say Mr Diller once hoped that Mr Murdoch might spin off Fox into a separate company and give him a stake. Yet there was also friction between the two men, caused by Mr Murdoch's growing involvement at Fox--though Mr Diller denies this. Even if Mr Murdoch did not fire Mr Diller, he clearly did not make too much of an effort to keep him.
The parting poses new challenges for both. The Fox empire-comprising film and television studios as well as the Fox network--is Mr Diller's creation. Yet its success may have made Mr Diller less essential than he once was. Its different parts can work separately: no other studio has a supremo like Mr Diller who directs both television and film operations. Mr Murdoch, who now spends three-quarters of his time in Los Angeles, says he will take on Mr Diller's job himself.
Is he up to it? Mr Murdoch will probably feel much more at home in television than film. He is no admirer of either extravagance or hype, both of which Hollywood has in abundance. Friends say he regards some of Tinseltown's business practices as downright fraudulent. Puritans have rarely thrived in Hollywood.
Speculation is rife about what Mr Diller will do next. Will he bid for Paramount, a big film studio (and owner of Simon & Schuster, a publisher), or CBS and NBC, two of America's three biggest television networks, both of which may be for sale? One complicated guess is that Mr Diller may buy NBC, reduce its weekly broadcasts from 22 hours to 15 hours to get round federal rules barring the same company owning a full-fledged network and a studio, and then sell it to a big studio such as Paramount, which has $1 billion in cash, or Disney.
That may be fanciful: Mr Diller says he will move slowly. But fuelling such speculation is the belief in the industry that another big round of empire building is likely and that Mr Diller is the man to begin it. He starts with an estimated $100m of his own money--and probably the support of several rich friends including David Geffen, who collected $750m in cash when he sold his record firm to MCA.
Would more cross-media mergers make sense? The experience of Time Warner argues against them. Three years ago Time and Warner looked like an appealing match, at least in theory. Time's magazines and cable-television companies would be the distributors and popularisers of the images and stars generated by Warner's film and record companies. At the top of the tree, complementing each other, would be Mr Ross, Warner's entreprencurial boss, and the more phlegmatic Mr Nicholas from Time. In 1994 Mr Ross was supposed to hand over control of the merged Time Warner to Mr Nicholas.
Rosy though this plan was, it hit two immediate snags. First, Paramount bid $200 a share for Time. To smother this rude interruption, Time had to borrow $14 billion to buy Warner outright, rather than complete a debt-free merger as planned. The second hitch proved just as damaging: Mr Ross and Mr Nicholas did not get on.
Rather than embracing the dream of synergy championed by Mr Ross and used to justify the merger, Mr Nicholas concentrated on running Time and cutting costs. He also opposed Mr Ross's decision to sell a $1 billion stake to Japan's Toshiba and C.Itoh and to seek other foreign partners. In the end, Mr Nicholas seems to have brought about his own downfall. When Mr Ross left the company last year to have treatment for prostate cancer, Mr Nicholas tried to assume control--a little too obviously. Mr Ross's supporters persuaded the board to replace him with Mr Levin, who has always got on better with Mr Ross and is more popular with Warner's managers in Hollywood. Even many Time veterans prefer him to the often ruthless Mr Nicholas.
However, changing one executive at the top is unlikely to resolve Time Warner's problems. These stem from the terms of the original merger. Warner's shareholders were paid richly in cash; Time's investors, who include a fair number of its staff, still hold shares whose market value is less than half the price Paramount offered for them. The huge salaries paid to Warner executives (especially Mr Ross) have caused more resentment at Time. And, whatever promises were made about power-sharing, it is clearly Mr Ross's company.
Such a one-sided deal is not wholly unfair. After all, Warner contributes nearly two-thirds of the company's operating income of $2.3 billion. Nevertheless, Time's employees are aggrieved, which scarcely encourages the various parts of the company to strive for the elusive benefits of synergy. In fact, the operations of both companies remain distinct and, so far, the merger has been a flop. Rather than getting bigger and bigger, as Mr Ross still seems to want the company to do, Mr Nicholas may have been right to concentrate on cutting costs and selling businesses. But then, why borrow billions to merge the two companies in the first place?"

Whether or not this is true probably does not matter all that much to most Coke drinkers. Just as important is the fact that the pop singer is willing to associate his name with that of Coke, even if he is being paid handsomely to do so. Among music fans, this presumably makes Coke trendy.
If this is so, it would seem to confirm the widely held view that advertising has little economic or social benefit, but is simply manipulative, intimidating or tricking consumers into acting against their own best interests. Many economists find this hard to swallow. According to one long-neglected theory, which dates back to Lester Telser and Phillip Nelson, two economists at the University of Chicago in the 1960s and 1970s, the mere fact that the amount spent on advertising often seems more important than the message does not mean that advertising has no economic function, or that consumers are irrational for being influenced by the ads. It implies that consumers are responding to signals beyond the explicit message of the ads. A new study* by London Business School (LBS) seems to confirm this.
How useful advertising is to the consumer and whether it is likely to be truthful will vary from one product to the next, depending on the kind of information that a consumer needs when choosing a product. The LBS team has sorted products into four broad categories, each of which, it thinks, is advertised in a different way:
* SEARCH GOODS. Consumers do not depend on information from the manufacturer to tell them about such products, because they can easily find out for themselves if they are worth buying. Any advertising that does occur is likely to be honest, because lies will be obvious. One example is curtains. If an advertiser claims that his curtains are blue when they are red, he fools no one. Advertising of such products, the study predicts, will be low.
* SHORT-TERM EXPERIENCE GOODS. Consumers cannot find out all they need to know about these products before buying them, but will know soon after their first purchase whether or not to buy them again. There is little point in an advertiser lying. Nevertheless, advertising such goods heavily tells consumers that the product will be around for a long time and that shopping for something better is probably a waste of time. One example is baked beans. Another is Diet Coke. The fact that Coca-cola is willing to spend a fortune to hire Elton John and millions more to broadcast him around the world signals to consumers that the company will continue to make Diet Coke available for a long time to come. Whether Elton John actually likes the drink, or whether it is trendy (the conventional theory), is probably irrelevant to most consumers.

And yet a lying advertiser will eventually get caught out.
So the LBS team reckons such an advertiser should not simply tell consumers that its product is better than its rivals'--everyone says that. Rather, it should signal that it believes the product will be around for a long time by spending more than its rivals advertising it. For these products, the amount spent on advertising can be just as important as any direct message the advertisement contains. This suggests that advertising will be heaviest for goods such as shampoo, cat food and vitamin pills, which the consumer can evaluate only over the long term.
* GOODS WHERE EXPERIENCE IS OF LITTLE VALUE. These products are mostly bought just once--or, at least, a particular model is. Examples are cars and washing machines.

To test its theory, the LBS team compared average advertising expenditure as a proportion of sales revenue in the four categories of product (see chart). (Chart omitted) Taking more than 300 products listed in Britain's 1989 Advertising Statistics Yearbook, the LBS confirmed that, as predicted, advertising is lowest, at some 0.4% of sales, for search goods and highest--5% of sales--for long-term experience goods.
The LBS study also confirms that, for long-term experience goods, high-quality products are more heavily advertised than low-quality products.

Whether or not this is true probably does not matter all that much to most Coke drinkers. Just as important is the fact that the pop singer is willing to associate his name with that of Coke, even if he is being paid handsomely to do so. Among music fans, this presumably makes Coke trendy.
If this is so, it would seem to confirm the widely held view that advertising has little economic or social benefit, but is simply manipulative, intimidating or tricking consumers into acting against their own best interests. Many economists find this hard to swallow. According to one long-neglected theory, which dates back to Lester Telser and Phillip Nelson, two economists at the University of Chicago in the 1960s and 1970s, the mere fact that the amount spent on advertising often seems more important than the message does not mean that advertising has no economic function, or that consumers are irrational for being influenced by the ads. It implies that consumers are responding to signals beyond the explicit message of the ads. A new study* by London Business School (LBS) seems to confirm this.
How useful advertising is to the consumer and whether it is likely to be truthful will vary from one product to the next, depending on the kind of information that a consumer needs when choosing a product. The LBS team has sorted products into four broad categories, each of which, it thinks, is advertised in a different way:
* SEARCH GOODS. Consumers do not depend on information from the manufacturer to tell them about such products, because they can easily find out for themselves if they are worth buying. Any advertising that does occur is likely to be honest, because lies will be obvious. One example is curtains. If an advertiser claims that his curtains are blue when they are red, he fools no one. Advertising of such products, the study predicts, will be low.
* SHORT-TERM EXPERIENCE GOODS. Consumers cannot find out all they need to know about these products before buying them, but will know soon after their first purchase whether or not to buy them again. There is little point in an advertiser lying. Nevertheless, advertising such goods heavily tells consumers that the product will be around for a long time and that shopping for something better is probably a waste of time. One example is baked beans. Another is Diet Coke. The fact that Coca-cola is willing to spend a fortune to hire Elton John and millions more to broadcast him around the world signals to consumers that the company will continue to make Diet Coke available for a long time to come. Whether Elton John actually likes the drink, or whether it is trendy (the conventional theory), is probably irrelevant to most consumers.
* LONG-TERM EXPERIENCE GOODS. Consumers cannot discover the quality or usefulness of such products without buying them repeatedly over a long period of time. Examples are motor oil and hair conditioner, two Products whose quality, or lack of it, can be determined only after any damage is done. In the case of such products, the consumer has lots to gain from truthful advertising; but equally, it would seem, advertisers could get away with lying for a long time before buyers caught them out.

This is proving a disaster for Japan's camera makers.
Out of the 26m cameras sold in America last year, fewer than im were fancy, auto-focusing models. Japanese makers managed to export only 3.3m of their top-of-the-range single-lens reflex cameras in 1991--down from a peak of 6.4m in 1981. Today many consumers prefer simpler, handier and even throw-away models with few high-margin accessories. Once lauded and feared as the most ruthless of Japanese exporters, the country's camera makers swept competitors aside by dazzling consumers with clever new technologies. Now it seems to be their turn to be swept aside.
In the midst of a crisis of confidence in the industry, a verdict by a New Jersey court on February 7th, ordering Minolta to pay $96m for infringing two Honeywell patents for automatic focusing, is making Japanese camera companies gloomier still. Honeywell is relentlessly pursuing 15 other camera makers who have adopted similar auto-focusing designs over the past few years. To bolster its bargaining position, Honeywell is seeking an injunction to prevent Minolta from trading in America. Minolta was already in dire straits before the court's ruling. Other proud names of the Japanese camera world--Canon, Nikon, Olympus and Asahi (maker of Pentax)--are now nervously awaiting the lawyer's knock on the door, and redoubling their efforts to break into other businesses.
But no court judgment, however harsh, will cost the camera companies as much as their uncharacteristic mistake in misreading recent trends in the photography market. The quickest to exploit, and encourage, these trends has been Fuji Photo Film. With a 70% share of the Japanese market for film and second worldwide only to Eastman Kodak, Fuji has attacked the camera market with gusto, catching traditional camera makers off guard with a range of startlingly successful disposable cameras.
At the other end of the market, the afficionados who once spent lavishly on the latest wizardry from Nikon, Minolta or Canon now tote the new generation of palm-sized video cameras offered by electronics giants such as Sony, Matsushita and Hitachi. Worse, those still buying cameras could not care less about grain size, depth-of-field, 1/f numbers and other photo-babble. All most consumers want is convenience, at rock-bottom prices. The high-tech skills carefully acquired over decades by Japanese camera makers are having to be redeployed to be worth anything.
Three things are happening as a result. One is a scramble by camera makers to ""downsize"" their bulky products. Konica started the trend to super-compact cameras in 1989 with its Big Mini. This pocket-sized camera, which weighed a mere 190 grams (7 oz), was the death-knell for the industry's fancy zoom and auto-focusing models that had accounted for the bulk of sales.
The second trend within the industry is to move even more of their production--in some cases, almost all--offshore. Ricoh has started producing camera parts in Shenzhen, China. The components are shipped to a subsidiary in Taiwan which is now turning out 250,000 cameras a month. Canon is also switching production of most of its cameras to Taiwan and elsewhere. Overseas production will account for 80% of Canon's camera output by the end of 1992, up from 35% in 1990.
The third change is to diversify out of camera making altogether, handing over the know-how to other companies with no big brand name in the camera market, but with low-cost factories abroad. Canon is in the process of supplying Kyocera, the Kyoto-based ceramic-package maker, with the technology for making super-compact cameras. Kyocera will manufacture the cameras in Hong Kong, which will then be exported under the Canon name. Canon is redeploying its engineers in Japan to design audio products. In August it will launch a range of sophisticated speakers for hi-fi buffs.
It is no accident that, of the six biggest camera companies in Japan, Canon is not only the healthiest but also the one with the smallest percentage of overall sales coming from cameras (see table). (Table omitted) Thanks to a 5,000-strong research team, Canon has been able to dream up lots of profitable new products. Its small photo-copiers and laser printers--two of the fastest-growing businesses around--now account for more than 60% of the company's sales.
On a smaller scale, Nikon has adroitly diversified into the semiconductor industry. More than 30% of its revenue now comes from selling ""steppers"", equipment used for manufacturing microchips. Olympus has diversified successfully into the medical field and now has 70% of the world market for instruments that peer inside the body. Asahi, too, is trying to break into the medical-equipment and office-automation markets. Even Minolta, the most troubled camera maker, now gets more than 50% of its revenue from selling office equipment. Within five years, many industry analysts reckon, there will be only one camera company left in Japan: Fuji, creator of the disposable camera. Other camera makers will either have joined the electronics industry or been tossed on the corporate scrap heap, where German and American camera makers ended their life 20 years ago."

Antoine Riboud, the boss of France's BSN, Europe's third-biggest food company, is not pulling his punches. By joining forces with Switzerland's food giant, Nestle, BSN is determined to stop Italy's Agnelli family snatching control of Source Perrier, the eponymous French producer of sparkling water. BSN is also signalling to the acquisitive Agnellis that it intends to remain independent. But even if Mr Riboud does thwart the Italians' ambitions in France, BSN will remain a tempting takeover target.
This saga began on November 28th, when the Agnellis launched a FFr5.6 billion ($930m) bid for two-thirds of Exor, a French holding company which controls 35% of Perrier. Then on January 5th Perrier sold 13.8% of itself to Saint Louis, a food and paper group that is an ally of the Agnellis. Saint Louis paid FFr1,235 a share for its stake. Nestle, which launched with an ally a FFr13.4 billion bid for Perrier on January 20th valuing the water company at FFr1,475 a share, contests the sale which it claims was agreed after Perrier and Saint Louis learnt Nestle was going to bid at a higher price. The French firms deny this.
The battle has now moved to the courts. On February 25th Nestle suffered a setback when the public prosecutor's office recommended that a Paris court uphold the Saint Louis transaction, even though an investigation has been launched into suspected insider share-trading during the deal. The court will reach a decision on March 16th. In another case, Nestle is trying to persuade a court in southern France to reduce Exor's voting rights in Perrier. A decision is expected on March 6th. If Nestle fails to win either case, its chances of succeeding look slim.
Enter BSN. On February 21st the French group launched a FFr6 billion counter-bid for Exor in an attempt to make the Agnellis negotiate. To avoid antitrust problems in France, BSN, which is already the biggest mineral-water company in the world, is proposing a carve-up of Exor and Perrier, with the Perrier brand going to Nestle, Exor's wine and property businesses going to the Agnellis, and BSN itself retaining Volvic, another of Perrier's water brands.
Why does BSN want a powerful rival such as Nestle to take control of Perrier? The answer is that Mr Riboud fears the Agnellis more than Nestle. In 1987 Mr Riboud and Gianni Agnelli, the head of the Italian dynasty, struck a deal in which the Italians, who also own the Fiat car and industrial group, agreed to help BSN build up its operations in Italy. In return, BSN helped the Agnellis to diversify into food. As part of the deal, the Agnellis took a 5.8% stake in BSN.
The trouble was that the Agnellis did not confine themselves to Italy. When Exor went up for sale, they bid for it without telling BSN first. That worried Mr Riboud, who felt uncomfortable with the idea of the Agnellis owning such a strong competitor. Worse, Mr Agnelli's younger brother, Umberto, hinted that the Italian group wanted to raise its stake in BSN, infuriating the fiercely independent Mr Riboud.
Even if BSN can deter the Agnellis, it may attract more unwelcome attention. Frederic Binggeli, an analyst with Sogenal, a Geneva-based bank, says that the food industry is now a ""game of giants"". Being big helps a food firm muscle its wayon to store shelves. New food brands are rarely big money-spinners, so established brands can be the key to success. BSN'S problem is that, although it is in several businesses (see chart) and is relatively large, it does not have a superbrand like Nestle's Nescafe or Philip Morris's Marlboro to generate enough cash to pay for more acquisitions. (Chart omitted) It is also heavily dependent on the sluggish European market, though Mr Riboud is slowly expanding the company's Asian operations.
BSN has an even bigger problem--the lack of an obvious successor to Mr Riboud. He dominates the company and seems in perfect health. But the mere fact that he is 73 seems to be attracting the attention of possible bidders."

Weapons makers can be left behind by technological changes as quickly as the manufacturers of more innocent products. And the fickleness of governments can play havoc with their business. Just ask Hans Widmer, the man recruited to turn round Oerlikon-Buhrle, an ailing Swiss industrial and arms group. After nearly a year in the job, Mr Widmer is still struggling to pull the loss-making arms-to-fashion-accessories group back into the black.
Oerlikon has been in trouble for years. Last year's operating loss of around SFr200m ($140m), on turnover of SFr3.6 billion, followed cumulative losses of SFr373m since 1985. That was the only year in which the company has paid a dividend to shareholders since 1982. When Dieter Buhrle, son of Oerlikon's founder and chairman of the group for 34 years, resigned in 1990, he left behind a company saddled with more than SFr2.5 billion in debt and unable to generate enough cash to make repayments of SFr250m a year. Oerlikon's banks stepped in. By mid-1991 half the group's top managers had been replaced, mostly by outsiders; the debt spiral had been halted by sales of the group's welding and insurance interests and the conversion of SFr300m of debt into equity.
What went wrong? In the 1970s Oerlikon was awash with money from lucrative Middle East arms contracts. Then the group's military division, most famous for its anti-aircraft guns, tried to develop an advanced anti-aircraft and anti-tank guided-missile system called ADATS. Disaster followed. With neither government backing nor a home market, the company poured SFr1 billion into the project. Today ADATS has just one customer: the Canadian government.
Despite warning signs, Mr Buhrle refused to abandon ADATS. By the time he quit, the military division had lost around SFr1 billion, plus restructuring costs of SFr1.2 billion. The Swiss government's arms embargo during the Gulf crisis cost the company another SFr250m-300m.
The military division, which accounts for more than a third of the group's total sales, is not struggling alone. Most of Oerlikon's other companies have been underperforming, too. Analysts reckon Bally, a shoe and fashion-accessories firm which accounts for nearly a third of Oerlikon's total sales, may have lost SFr10m last year.
Mr Widmer has given himself until 1994 to turn the company round. He describes his strategy as ""back-to-basics"" and it includes the usual doses of cost cutting, reorganisation and sales of ""non-core"" businesses. Oerlikon still has some strong businesses such as Balzers, a leading producer of thin-film materials (used for lenses, compact discs and liquid-crystal displays). The company also controls potentially profitable ventures in space technology, textiles, property and Swiss hotels.
But Mr Widmer's biggest headache remains Oerlikon's military division, which he has failed to sell. With no buyer in sight, he will now concentrate on shrinking the business by half. By 1994 it should account for only a fifth of total sales, which are expected to fall to SFr3.5 billion. In 1986 the group employed 33,000 people worldwide; now the number is 18,500; by 1994 it should be only 16,600. But cash flow, according to the plan, will rise to 10% of turnover--a huge gain on last year's 0.5%--and net debts will drop to SFr1.5 billion. These targets sound wonderful, but even a determined Mr Widmer may need longer to save the company from the hangover left by its flop in missiles. Nevertheless, faced with the alternative of trying to flog Oerlikon's best businesses in a buyers' market, the company's banks are willing to let him keep on trying."

But if a firm's owner is a government willing to dig into taxpayers' pockets, not only to cover its losses but also to pay for the management's soaring ambitions, then anything is possible. Iberia, Spain's state-owned airline, lost $135m in 1990 and at least $380m in 1991. Yet it has gone on a spending spree in a bid to become a big competitor across the Atlantic. The extraordinary plan of Miguel Aquilo, Iberia's president, is to buy lots of other loss-making state airlines. In doing so, Mr Aquilo aims to build a formidable position on routes serving Latin America from the United States and Europe. Some day Iberia may even make a profit.
Last year Iberia bought control, along with local investors, of Aerolineas Argentinas and Venezuela's VIASA, both state-run loss-makers, and a private Chilean airline, LADECO. It has been discussing the purchase of Scandinavian Airline System's share in another independent airline, LAN-Chile, as well as the acquisition of a controlling stake in the Dominican Republic's loss-making state-owned airline. Iberia says it is also interested in buying controlling stakes in the state-owned airlines of Paraguay, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Peru.
There is a design behind this frenzy of deal-making. First, claims Iberia, the airlines are bargains, even with their losses, because it buys them using the home country's foreign debt, which it snaps up on the secondary market at huge discounts. Grateful to have their enormous debts shaved by any amount, governments have accepted the paper at face value and given equity in return.
Second, the new acquisitions not only provide a big chunk of the Latin American market, but also give Iberia access to the United States, the single-biggest airline market in the world, through the web of government-to-government agreements regulating flights between the United States and the various Latin American countries. Through Aerolineas Argentinas, Iberia is able to operate from New York, Los Angeles and the main European capitals to Buenos Aires. And through VIASA and LADECO it can operate from the United States and Europe to Caracas and Santiago (and thence to other South American capitals).
At the same time Iberia plans to expand its own operations in the United States. It has successfully encouraged the Spanish government to provide more access to Spain for American airlines, and in return will be allowed to pick up passengers in Miami and another airport in the southern United States (possibly Dallas) and fly them to any Latin American country except Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay or Uruguay, provided the country concerned agrees. If enough governments do agree, Iberia aims to open a Miami ""hub"" this summer with four aircraft offering regular flights to Latin America. This would complement a hub it plans to create at Buenos Aires.
Will it work? Iberia may be able to make big savings by combining the computer-reservation systems, sales offices, aircraft maintenance, spares and freight-handling of Latin American airlines. The $1.2 billion of new capital (either loans or equity or both) recently promised to Iberia by the Spanish government will help, too. But profits may materialise only when the economies of Latin America, which together still support only a fairly small airline market, start to grow after years of decay. The signs are that this is happening. But if the economies, and passenger traffic, do not grow quickly enough to justify Iberia's ambitious expansion strategy, the Spanish taxpayer will foot the bill."

Since mid-January, two weeks after Russian prices were liberalised, the rouble has risen from 110 to the dollar to 70. Some black marketeers are selling dollars fbr only 45 roubles.
Proof that the reforms are working? Virtually no one except the Russian govemment thinks so. Russian economists and western bankers in Moscow dismiss the rouble's rise as a temporary response to either central-bank intervention or a shortage of rouble notes because the central bank's printing presses simply cannot keep up with the demand for higher-denomination bills. Both explanations assume that the rouble's rally is unsustainable. Many people guess that when the printing presses catch up with the demand for cash, the rouble will plummet.
There is something in this. But a less gloomy conclusion may be warranted. True, the central bank has been intervening to support the rouble, but not by enough to account fbr the rouble's dramatic rise. It started buying roubles in mid-February--after the rouble's rally had begun.
The shortage of notes has had a bigger effect. Many enterprises which cannot take money out of their accounts are asking their employees to wait for their wages. According to the Russian govemment, some 19 billion roubles' worth of unpaid wages have accumulated since December--nearly 20% of a month's total wage bill. To avoid such delays, some enterprises are using dollars to buy roubles.
Yet just consider this: the price of roubles sold through bank transactions, in which no cash changes hands, is also rising. In the cash market at the end of January, the exchange rate was 130 roubles. In the non-cash market, it was 230. If the cash squeeze alone were causing the rouble's rise, there would be no obvious reason why the non-cash rate should change. But it did, rising from 230 roubles to 136 roubles at the end of February. That suggests that a real monetary squeeze, not just a temporary liquidity crunch, is behind the rouble's rise.
Moreover, the rouble's rise has been fuelled by a sharp increase in the dollars being offered for sale by enterprises. At the end of January $5.4m were offered for sale in the non-cash market. On February 18th this had risen to $18.3m. This is a hopeful sign. Enterprises stashed an estimated $14 billion abroad last year. They may now be starting to bring some of that money home.
It would be too much to hope that the rise will continue smoothly. As high denomination bank notes are printed--ie, as the cash supply rises--the exchange rate is likely to fall. But that will not necessarily mean that economic reform is failing, merely that a period of volatility is inevitable. In the long term, if the government is able to cut its budget deficit and restrict the flow of credit to enterprises, the rouble should rise further. But how far?
A sustainable rate depends on the level of wages. By this measure, the rouble may be undervalued even after its rally, because it values average monthly wages at little more than $15. Many economists believe that Russia is roughly as rich as Poland before its ""big bang"" reforms in 1990. After big bang, the average monthly wage in Poland stabilised at about $100. So that may be a reasonable guess for the market price for Russian labour. Average monthly wages in Russia of between 1,500 to 1,800 roubles translate into a ""correct"" exchange rate of 15-18 roubles to the dollar.
That, last December, was the rate Yegor Gaidar, the minister of finance,said the government hoped to defend. With wages rising, this rate now seems too high. The government is hoping to persuade the IMF to finance a stabilisation fund to defend a rate of around 50 roubles per dollar, which implies that wages will more than triple. Even that rate would mean that the rouble's rise has only just begun."

If the cost is high today, it will be higher tomorrow. There may be 300,000 to 400,000 such places, containing anything from tanks of nasty chemicals to ordinary household waste mixed with discarded car batteries and drums of pesticide. The cost falls mainly on companies and, increasingly, on their insurers. Some firms believe that no satisfactory technology yet exists for cleaning old sites at a manageable cost.
Estimates of the eventual price of cleaning are of the ""think-of-a-number"" variety. A study from the University of Tennessee, published in December, produced a top guess of $1.18 trillion for the cost over the next 30 years, in 1990 prices, of cleaning to high standards all old waste sites, including those owned by the departments of energy and defence. A more conservative guess by Paul Portney of Resources for the Future, a Washington think-tank, is that the average cost of cleaning a site on the priority list of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is about $40m. Assume that there will be 2,000 such sites by the end of the century; add on $16 billion fbr litigation over who should foot the bill; and the total cost by 2000 might be only $96 billion.
Such waste dumps are known as ""Superfund"" sites because they are covered by a law passed in 1980 which set up a large government fund to clean them up, the costs to be recouped later from the original polluter by the EPA--unless, that is, the polluter can be made to pay first. So far, over 1,200 Superfund sites have been identified by the EPA, and the tally is rising by 100 a year. Almost any company that has ever been involved in a site is potentially responsible for cleaning it; the liability is strict (no proof of negligence is needed), joint-and-several (one company may be liable for all the cost, even though it was one of many culprits) and retroactive. Even if a company stuck to the law, it is still liable. One Californian firm rejected a suggestion by local officials that it deposit waste in a municipal dump; it insisted that the materials should be disposed of, at higher cost to itself, in a specialised site. This worthy decision has since been used to charge the company for part of the cost of cleaning that site.
As more and more sites are identified, the cost of cleaning them will soar. A study due to be published shortly by the Rand Corporation, a Californian think-tank, predicts that legal fees and other transaction costs will rise as a proportion of total bills: so far, the sites that have progressed furthest are those that involved only one or two large firms, which carry their risk themselves. Such companies frequently decide to split the cost and press ahead rather than incur the expense and bad publicity of lengthy court battles. Where smaller companies, or many companies, are involved, litigation is more likely as firms sue insurers and insurers sue each other: Kevin McCarthy, in charge of the Rand study, reports that the number of pending claims is rising rapidly.
Rising costs are not balanced by clear benefits. The main rationale for the Superfund clean-up programme is concern about human health. Yet a report by the National Academy of Sciences in October drew attention to how little is known about the effects on health of most chemicals found in hazardous-waste sites. The EPA itself argues that other environmental hazards, such as radon gas in houses and cigarette smoke, pose far greater risks to health than the Superfund sites which Congress has made such a high priority.
Increasingly, the companies involved in Superfund sites face a further difficulty. The technology to clean sites may simply not exist, or be prohibitively expensive. The options are few: to seal a site from public access and from leaking into groundwater; to dig up the earth and dump it somewhere else; to incinerate soil; or to pump water through it to wash out the contaminants. None is wholly satisfactory. At Monsanto, a large chemical company involved in over 100 sites, a team of experts has been scouring the world for evidence of viable techniques. In vain: those currently available, says the company, cost up to $10m an acre. Richard Mahoney, Monsanto's chief executive, is now lobbying the government for a joint research programme, involving industry, government and academia.
Pressure for change seems to be growing. Congress is nervous of any reform; when Superfund legislation came up for re-authorisation last year, it was quietly hustled through without debate. But the insurance industry, which may have to pick up huge bills for Superfund sites, is as keen on a change in the law as industrial firms such as Monsanto.
America's problems with deciding who should pay to clean old sites are not unique. Most European countries currently assume that, if waste was carefully disposed of, the taxpayer should pay to clean it up later. But the European Commission has been trying for several years to draft a directive on environmental liability which would shift part of the cost to companies and is contemplating new proposals along these lines.
Britain may be about to go down the same route. Under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, local councils will begin in April to draw up registers of contaminated sites. Although the wording of the act is unclear, it appears to give authorities the powers to recover the costs of site-cleaning from the original polluter or the landowner. Some lawyers think that the legal definition of ""owner"" could sometimes be a bank that had taken possession of a site through fore-closure on a mortgage. These powers have not yet been put to use. If they are, British companies may be protesting as loudly as American ones."

The bills fbr the worst financial disaster in recent American history will continue to mount. But at last thrifts, regulators and politicians can look beyond disaster to plan the future.
Special hearings on controversial new ways of dealing with insolvent thrifts are to be held next month. The first order of business for Congress is another bill to refinance the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the agency charged under the 1989 thrifts bailout act with cleaning up the mess. On February 24th Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, asked for an extra $55 billion on top of the $105 billion that has already been approved in dribs and drabs. Even $160 billion, as Mr Brady told the House banking committee, may not prove to be enough.
Few disagree. Yet in an election year, most politicians dare not draw attention to such enormous numbers, or to Congress's part in the cack-handed deregulation that led to them. They are likely to pass the increase without fuss.
How the money is to be spent is another matter. The thrifts debacle has done for a generation of law-makers what the Great Crash did for a generation of their forebears. It has cast the die for the regulation of the financial system for years to come. Politicians now regard deposit-taking institutions almost as public utilities, whose first duty is to avoid being a charge on taxpayers.
The cheapest way of dealing with a bust financial institution is usually to dispose of it as quickly as possible. With thrifts, there are two difficulties. The first is that this is not a great market on which to dump a lot of their assets-typically property, delinquent loans and commercial mortgages. The RTC's new boss, Albert Casey, counted $129 billion-worth of these assets on his books at the end of last year. He reckons that three-quarters are nearly worthless: property markets are already glutted, and would be further depressed by a massive sale. The agency is repackaging the better assets, residential mortgages, into securities, but selling only $1 billion of them a month. Mr Casey aims to step that up by a quarter this year.
The second snag is that although some thrifts which the RTC takes over (it now has more than 110 in its charge, down from 606 in 1989) may pull through in time, and at little cost to the taxpayer, most will not. The public ends up paying far more for lingering illness than it would have done for speedy burial. A study by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that regulators' forbearance accounted for $66 billion of the $127 billion (in 1990 dollars) spent on the 1,130 thrifts closed between 1980 and 1991.
A scathing report on the RTC, published on February 25th by the General Accounting Office, reinforces the RTC'S many critics who claim that the ineptness of its salvage operations is partly responsible for their escalating cost. It accuses the agency of keeping such bad records that it does not know what it is doing. The RTC admits faults, but says that Congress started to give it the cash it needed only last year. The report also warns that the RTC may have to dip into its loss fund to top up working capital; potential asset sales have been overestimated.
Cost touches a raw nerve in Congress. That is why many politicians do not like regulators' new plans for dealing with bust thrifts. Timothy Ryan, who heads the Office of Thrift Supervision, and William Taylor, the new head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), propose that the government nurse thrifts back to health before selling them off (see box on next page).
The regulators--and, informally, the administration--believe they have little choice. Not only are thrift assets hard to sell; banks are becoming less keen to buy sanitised thrifts for next to nothing, filling gaps in their networks against the day when interstate branching is allowed. Now that the institutions in the RTC's care are fewer and weaker, banks may well be even more cautious. The agency is also under political pressure to get higher prices for its disposals.
So the RTC may have to liquidate many of its remaining patients. That will not be easy either. The administration is unlikely to relish spectacular thrift closures, especially in places where the president has political problems. Three of the big insolvent thrifts are in just such a state: California.
It may not matter much if the RTC cannot shift its last few thrifts. The industry seems anyway to be shrinking more slowly than it was. The number of thrift institutions has fallen to barely 2,250 from more than 4,000 at the beginning of the 1980s, and their assets to less than $980 billion from a peak of $1.4 trillion in 1988. Veribanc, a Massachusetts firm that follows the industry, reckons that 1,900 thrifts may end up dividing total assets of $775 billion--roughly what they were in the early 1980s.
Yet it is difficult to see how the clock can truly be turned back for the thrifts. They seem to have little future except as mortgage specialists or full-service community banks. Many already call themselves savings banks. Mr Ryan and Mr Taylor want to make it easier for those who chose to go this route to convert to banking charters.
But being a community bank may not turn out to be much more fun than being a thrift. Commercial banks and credit unions have made consumer banking fearfully competitive, and banks of all sorts are being stormed by non-banks. To give their charges a possible advantage, the regulators also propose to allow federally chartered thrifts to branch freely across state lines. That too faces congressional opposition, as a possible backdoor to the interstate branching for banks which the politicians rejected last year.
Having allowed thrifts to be more like banks in the 1970S and 1980s, with such disastrous consequences, Congress now wants to be sure that they know their place in the 1990s. And that is the worst of it for thrifts, both sick and healthy. Being condemned to the past is no future at all.
STILL ON THE FLOOR
A groggy New York thrift that lost $301m in the first nine months of last year, CrossLand Federal was once the 14th largest savings-and-loan association in America. It has now become the first test of regulators' new desire to nurse troubled institutions back to health, rather than liquidating them or selling them immediately, stripped of their worst assets, to healthier ones.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) nationalised CrossLand in January, after it failed last year. Like others, CrossLand had expanded wildly in the 1980s. It spread far beyond its heartland in Brooklyn and suburban Long Island to mount operations in the states of Washington, Florida, New Jersey and Utah. It built a reputation for property lending that was daring even by the standards of its rivals. The property bust of the late 1980s sent it reeling; Congress delivered the knock-out punch in 1989 with mandatory capital requirements for thrifts.
The FDIC'S financial sponge-men are seeking to revive CrossLand with new capital and management. A transfer of $1.2 billion was followed by that of Richard Kraemer, former head of New York's Bowerie Savings Bank. Mr Kraemer, as native to Brooklyn as the bridge, is a property specialist who has spent 30 of his 47 years in New York thrifts.
The agency's actions are far from popular. Politicians and private bankers criticise it for rejecting two commercial-bank bids for CrossLand. Some say the FDIC turned down Republic New York and Chase Manhattan simply in order to test its new strategy. The agency replies that it was just doing things the cheapest way, as legislation now requires it to do.
A larger concern is that the FDIC'S approach appears to be inconsistent with the need to encourage consolidation in the fragmented banking and thrift industries, especially in overbanked markets like New York. It also seems risky to bet that the government can improve the thrift enough to get a substantially better price when it sells it again, as it promises to do in a couple of years.
CrossLand itself is suitably chastened. With assets of barely $7 billion (two-fifths as large as in 1988), it now aims to become a full-service community bank. But, like other financial prodigals, it returns to find its old market far tougher than it was a decade ago.
Many of its blue-collar savers (or their jobs) have gone, reducing the opportunities for its staples--mortgages and consumer loans. Commercial banks are wooing those that are left with a far wider range of consumer products, including mutual funds and credit cards. CrossLand will have to fight hard to make a comeback--and the FDIC to make a point."

On February 26th Commercial Union, a British composite insurer, announced a pre-tax loss for 1991 of L68.6m ($121m); the next day Royal, a rival, declared it was L373M in the red, and cut its dividend. The other three big composites are likely to report losses. For two years the composites have leaked cash.
Recession has certainly contributed. Theft, arson and fraudulent claims have flourished. So have defaults on mortgages; the insurers that indemnified building societies against associated losses shelled out over L1 billion last year. Winter storms have blown down buildings; summer droughts have shrivelled clay foundations in England's south. These misfortunes coincided with a trough in the insurance cycle. The profitable late 1980s encouraged a scramble for volume; prices fell; profits dried up.
The cycle is now turning in Britain. The price of motor and home-contents insurance rose by 20% and 15% in 1991, according to analysts at S.G. Warburg; in commercial lines, only property rates show little sign of firming. But the best news is that insurers seem to be reforming more than their prices. Top managers are turning their attention to bits of their business they had half-forgotten. If they do what they promise, they may even stop the next cyclical downturn.
Take Royal Insurance, a company so weak it might have been taken over, were it not for the black hole of its mortgage-indemnity liabilities. Moody's, a rating agency, recently demoted Royal's commercial paper to the lowest grade above junk. Its solvency ratio (shareholders' funds divided by net premium income) has been the worst in the industry, obliging it to raise L416m since December by selling stakes in German and Dutch insurers. Alone among the big composites, Royal has appointed a director with particular responsibility for underwriting. He is Roy Elms, and his message is: ""It might sound boring, but we plan to refocus attention on the basic skills of underwriting and claims handling.""
Like its rivals, Royal has started to price buildings insurance by post-code, to reflect varying risks of subsidence. Unlike some, including Commercial Union, it has not yet adjusted its prices to capture different exposures to storm. But last year Royal also began to improve its statistical work on its motor portfolio. Insurers have long tracked the relationship between type of policyholder--age, sex, car type and so on--and frequency and cost of claims. They have tried to price policies accordingly. The imprecision of their work, however, shows up in wildly different prices: a motorist may find one insurer offering him a policy at one-third the price that another does.
In particular, statisticians are not always sure which characteristics matter most. Are women drivers really safer? Or do they make fewer claims because they drive slower cars? If, for the sake of argument, insurers mistakenly supposed that women were intrinsically more prudent, a company with cleverer statisticians could prosper by selling cheap policies to men in slow cars. Though vague on the details of its new statistical tactics, Royal hints that it aims to discover this sort of niche. It also says that faster reporting of underwriting information should yield early warning of a softening cycle, so prompting higher premiums before losses grow.
Then comes the handling of claims. Hard times have induced most insurers to squeeze costs; Commercial Union, for example, has reduced in-house expenses (excluding commissions paid to salesmen) from 18% of premium income in 1984 to 11%. But three-quarters of the money paid out by insurers goes on claims. That presents a vast opportunity to save.
Last year Royal expanded its claims-handling staff in Britain by 10%, even though total staff is shrinking. Hard questions get asked when claims look excessive. More effort is made to replace stolen goods, rather than paying cash; this is cheaper, because Royal negotiates bulk discounts (10-15% on electrical goods, up to 40% on jewellery). The same principle lightens motor claims. Royal has just over 1,000 recommended repairers, with whom it negotiates discounts of around 15-20%; policyholders who take their cars to these garages are rewarded with a guarantee that the repair will last. A year ago 40% of Royal's policyholders went along with this. Now 55% do. The firm hopes three-quarters will by 1994.
There is still scope for saving. Royal's American subsidiary has halved the cost of fending off policyholders' litigation by hiring its own lawyers; though the British sue less, litigation is nonetheless expensive. The Americans also say that specialisation has improved the productivity of claims staff. They have 75 people working exclusively on claims arising from one insurance policy (a product-liability cover for a large car maker). And last year they set up six fraud investigation units, staffed partly with ex-police officers. This has already saved $10m."

For nine months the FT-SE 100 index has wavered either side of the 2,500 mark. Ask an equity strategist and he will say London is undervalued, both by past standards and against other markets. Yet, for all their faults, markets work. If investors shared the strategists' view, the undervaluation would soon disappear. What is holding London back?
Consider first the evidence of undervaluation. The dividend yield on British equities is around 5%. Not only is this high by past standards; falling inflation means that it is Positive in real terms for the first time in years. The yield gap between bonds and equities is also low. At around 9-1/2%, gilt yields are currently 1.9 times dividend yields. Sushil Wadwhani of Goldman Sachs notes that the ratio has been below two just seven times in the past 20 years. Each time, the equity market rose over the following 12 months.
In New York, by contrast, the ratio of bond to equity yields is over 2.5, high by historical standards. Price/earnings ratios tell a similar story. London's p/e ratio of just over 15 is well off its 1980s peak. And, though international comparisons are tricky, it is also well below p/e ratios in New York and Tokyo and a bit below Frankfurt. London's recent performance has been dismal compared with other markets. The FT-SE index is at its lowest relative to New York's Dow-Jones industrial average since 1984. This year London has underperformed Frankfurt and Paris by 6% and 8% respectively.
Superficially, then, London looks cheap. Analysts offer four explanations for investors' reluctance to jump in:
* POLITICS. The market often drifts ahead of an election. Though most investors still expect a narrow Tory victory, the odds on Labour or a hung Parliament are shortening. That could explain the gloom over shares in privatised companies (such as BT) that are subject to government regulation. Yet with all parties committed to the discipline of Europe's exchange-rate mechanism (ERM), scope for economic mismanagement is smaller than before. And the gilts market, normally more sensitive to political worries than equities, has recently been strong.
* ECONOMICS. False sightings of economic recovery have made some investors fear that the recession could turn into prolonged slump. It has certainly lasted longer than expected, but the notion that it could become a repeat of the 1930s seems far-fetched. Most forecasters reckon the economy will pick up by the second half of the year; if they are right, equities ought to be reflecting it now. One problem is that the ERM has tied British interest rates to Germany's, which the Bundesbank remains reluctant to cut. New York shares have been boosted by tumbling interest rates. These have brought recovery closer and have also, by trimming yields on cash and bonds, made American equities more attractive.
* YIELD UNCERTAINTY A low p/e ratio and a small yield gap might mean not that prices are too low, but that the market is worried about the future course of earnings and dividends. Many investors were edgy before the current results season. The past week has seen a string of poor earnings from such companies as Barclays, NatWest, Royal insurance and Vickers. Poor results have also revived the old debate about dividends. While purists argue that distribution policy should not affect share values, fund managers have redoubled their warnings to companies not to cut dividends unexpectedly. Few firms have made a cut; most of those that have were discounted in advance. Vickers's share price, for instance, rose after it trimmed its dividend.
* THE NORWICH UNION ISSUE--so called when Norwich Union, a big life insurer, said it was moving part of its portfolio from equities into bonds. The idea is that thanks to the ERM, Britain may be moving to a permanently lower inflation rate, which should be good for fixed-interest bonds. The recent fall in the bond/equity yield ratio may reflect this. Some go further and argue that the 30-year cult of the equity is over. On this argument dividend yields should one day exceed bond yields because equities are riskier--meaning that share prices could plummet.
The argument seems striking, but there are three reasons for thinking it could be premature. One is that inflation is far from dead. Even if it remains under 4%, it is still well above levels in the 1950s, when the cult of the equity began. The second is that although lower inflation is clearly good for bonds, it is also good for equities because it reduces uncertainty. Even though disinflation initially slows the economy--and so corporate earnings--there is no long-run correlation between high inflation and growth. Third is the empirical evidence. Goldman Sachs has looked back to the 1920s, both in Britain and abroad. It finds no evidence that falling inflation reduces the bond/equity yield gap; if anything, it has widened it.
WALLS OF MONEY?
The strongest of these four explanations is probably the political one, especially for overseas investors. Most are underweight in British equities, and many accept that the London market looks cheap. But they see little to gain by committing themselves ahead of the election. On this basis, some see a wall of money ready to hit Britain if the Tories win.
Sounds familiar? It should, for many said the same thing about the election in June 1987. In fact, the money did not arrive. But there are two differences between then and now. One is that the market was overheated in June 1987. The second is that British investors were still adjusting their portfolios in response to the abolition of exchange controls in 1979. With nearly a quarter of pension-fund assets now in foreign securities, many fund managers think adjustment is complete. Moreover, as investing institutions grow on the continent, they will buy into the biggest European share market--London.
So those who reckon that London will rise by year-end look to have the better of the argument. But investors should still be wary of stockbroker optimism. However detached a broker may seem, he may merely be talking his own book."

On February 17th his offer to resign was rejected by the finance minister, Carlos Solchaga. On February 20th he convinced many, when he appeared before parliament, that he was innocent and indeed ignorant of suspicious share deals carried out on his behalf in 1990.
But on February 24th a Spanish newspaper made fresh and far more damaging allegations. These encouraged the conservative opposition, the Popular Party, to call on February 25th for a broad parliamentary inquiry. Spain's ruling Socialists are likely to squash any such move, but a scandal that apparently links high finance, high society and low politics will not soon disappear.
At issue are murky dealings in the shares of Sistemas Financieros, part of an investment-banking group called Ibercorp that is run by a former chairman of the Madrid Stock Exchange, Manuel de la Concha. Mr de la Concha manages money for a number of Spain's great and near-great, among them Mr Rubio. In the spring of 1990 Ibercorp sold some investors' holdings in Sistemas Financieros, whose share price slid from more than Ptas5,000 in March to less than Ptas2,000 in December. Ibercorp denies that it knew disaster loomed and bailed out favoured clients.
An audit of Sistemas Financieros revealed a year later that the company had apparently bought a large number of its own shares, and prompted the National Stockmarket Commission (CNMV) to look into the matter. On request, Ibercorp provided a list of the investors from whom Sistemas Financieros had bought shares. Curiously, some were identified by their mothers' rather than their fathers' surnames. Though correct national identity numbers were given, the CNMV appears not to have spotted in Messrs Jimenez and Salvador the current governor of the central bank and the former minister of the economy, Miguel Boyer. Spurred by newspaper reporting, the CNMV looked harder, and has now launched a full investigation of Ibercorp for what it terms ""a very serious offence"".
Now where? Mr Rubio says that the portfolio which Ibercorp manages for him is worth just Ptas12m ($117,000); he had only Ptas5m invested in Sistemas Financieros. There is no rule forbidding the head of the Bank of Spain to own equities or anything else, though some now think there should be. The more damaging assertion by El Mundo, a national daily, on February 24th that Mr Rubio tipped off Mr de la Concha before interest-rate and other important moves has not been substantiated, nor is it likely to be. The paper's allegations against Mr Boyer, however, should be capable of proof one way or the other--though not, perhaps, of clear conclusions. He presided over Banco Exterior when the state-owned bank reportedly made available credit lines totalling Ptas3 billion to two Ibercorp companies, neither of which, it is alleged, had even Ptas125m in capital.
Even so, the Ibercorp affair will have a consequences. The most obvious is for the firm itself, which now faces official scrutiny that it might have preferred to avoid. Like many small banks, Ibercorp is in financial trouble anyway, hoist by high interest rates in the interbank market from which it borrows. It declared losses of Ptas473m for 1990; its auditors reckoned the figure should have been higher. The Bank of Spain is trying to find a buyer for Ibercorp. The task looked thankless even before the scandal.
The second consequence is for Mr Rubio's tenure at the central bank. Although Mr Solchaga has asked him to stay on until his term expires in July, it is now unlikely that he will seek a third mandate. The most likely man to succeed him is the current deputy governor, Luis Angel Rojo. There is little doubt that Mr Rojo would pursue his predecessor's tough anti-inflation policies--with less political flair, perhaps, but a better theoretical brain.
The third likely legacy is a deepening of the scepticism with which many Spaniards regard those in power. Mr Rubio, like Mr Boyer, has ties to the Socialist Party. He is one of the ""beautiful people"" whose doings spur thousands to buy Hola, a weekly society-gossip magazine. He is a good central-bank governor and may well have done nothing wrong. That will not prevent the episode from tarnishing both him and allies like Mr Solchaga on the Socialist right, whose tough policies grow daily less popular as Spain's wondrous economy slows."
29-Feb-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224137941/fulltext/478A016E5146472BPQ/50?accountid=14657,"The share-splitting season has begun. Cheers from shareholders greeted Disney's announcement of a four-for-one split at the entertainment firm's annual meeting on February 18th. In Britain on February 25th SmithKline Beecham, a drugs firm, and Grand Metropolitan, a food-and-drink firm, followed suit, both proposing two-for-one share splits.
Investors did not just cheer, they raised their valuation of the firms. Disney shares rose by nearly $4 (to an unsplit $146) on the day of the announcement. Shares in both SmithKline and Grand Metropolitan jumped too (though they slipped back later). This is typical; several academic studies have found that share prices rise when splits are announced, and at least one study, by the New York Stock Exchange, concluded that they go on rising faster than non-splitters.
Why? After all, a share-split gives shareholders nothing more than extra bits of paper; they own no more of the firm, and no less. Most firms say that splits boost liquidity and make life easier for the small investor. They split their shares when they reach above-average prices. Most companies on the London Stock Exchange that split their shares do so at around L10 (SmithKline's is L9.15, Grand Metropolitan's L9.47), those on the NYSE at just over $40. Academic studies find that splits do indeed attract extra shareholders and increase the number of transactions in the firm's shares. They do not, though, increase the total value of shares traded. In fact volume usually falls after a share-split, though this may be because trading just before one is unusually high.
Why are investors willing to pay higher prices? One explanation, which academics confirm, is that share-splits are a signal by management that a jump in earnings is coming, and their firm is undervalued. Firms that split were usually tracked beforehand by fewer analysts than others of similar size. After a split, the share price moves more independently of the market, which suggests that the firm is being watched more closely.
But why use such an economically inefficient signal? Share-splitting costs money and brings no other obvious benefits. Two Californian economists, Michael Brennan and Patricia Hughes, have thought up one intriguing explanation. For any given value of share transaction, the greater the quantity of shares being traded, the higher the commission earned by the brokers. On a $5,000 trade, the broker's commission might be 1% higher for $10 shares than for $50 shares. Share splits, say the academics, attract analysts' attention with a carrot--higher fees.
Maybe--although well-known businesses like Disney and SmithKline have less need to curry favour with brokers than the little-known small firms that are the most frequent splitters. Perhaps there is a better explanation waiting to be discovered. Alternatively, of course, the whole share-splitting process may be misguided from start to finish."

Keener than most to avoid admitting that an investment or a loan has gone wrong, the Japanese have perfected ways of getting unattractive assets into other hands when end-year balance sheets are drawn up. Since last summer's securities scandals, that dodge has become harder--and a new round of scandals is beginning to hit the headlines.
Cosmo Securities, a medium-sized securities firm, announced on February 24th that it had agreed in an out-of-court settlement to pay Y41.5 billion ($321m) to Skylark, a restaurant chain. At issue is a repurchase agreement that fell through. It has long been entrenched practice in Japan for a company facing a loss on an investment to move it to another company with a different financial year-end, on the understanding that the seller will buy it back, paying an agreed amount of ""interest"". A securities firm often guarantees such agreements.
In the Cosmo case (details of which remain obscure), it seems that a sales manager at the securities firm needed to raise cash to compensate corporate clients for losses on their share portfolios. He got the money by persuading Skylark, last July, to pay Y40.8 billion for American zero-coupon bonds which were then worth only Y5 billion. (Zeros are used because they are unlisted securities in Japan and so their prices can be more easily manipulated.) Skylark was promised a profit of Y2 billion on the transaction.
An unnamed third party had promised to buy back the bonds, but subsequently refused to do so. Skylark went to court; Cosmo has now agreed to buy the zeros back for the amount that Skylark originally paid, plus Y740m in interest. Since the zeros are now valued at Y5.5 billion, Cosmo faces a net loss of Y36 billion, or one-third of its capital. Cosmo's chairman, and the individuals responsible, have resigned.
Cosmo's is not an isolated case. Daiwa, Japan's second-biggest broker, agreed this week to pay 3.5 billion to Tokyu Land, a property company, to settle a similar dispute. More cases are in the works. The pressure is on: depressed share prices mean that more investments look awful, and most Japanese companies are cleaning up their books before the financial year closes in March. (Skylark's yea-rend is in December, which is why its case came first.)
Stockbrokers are on the defensive anyway. After last summer's scandals, the Securities and Exchange Law was revised, making it illegal for firms to guarantee investment returns to clients. This may mean that more securities houses have to make hefty pay-outs like Cosmo, on a scale which threatens their financial independence. It is no coincidence that the Ministry of Finance seems suddenly to have decided to raise the maximum stake that a bank can hold in a securities company from 5% to 50%, reversing its longstanding opposition to such a move. Whether the banks will want to buy stockbrokers in the present grim climate is another matter."

Unless, that is, they look up. Astronomers are increasingly infatuated with the south pole's unique charms, and their discipline is the fastest-growing area of Antarctic science. Some of them love the place for its dryness, some for its six-month days and nights. Others prize the constant winds and the profound darkness of the sky.
Antarctic astronomy began in 1979 with observations of the sun. Sunrise and sunset make continuous studies of the sun's surface impossible from most places. At the south pole, though, an astronomer can observe the sun for hundreds of hours at a time, since sunrise is in September and sunset in March. For those who study the twitchings of the sun's surface, which provide insights into its deep structure, long observations are a great boon. They make the data much more reliable.
Most astronomers, though, want to look at stars farther away--the ones that come out only at night. As yet, there is not much infrastructure for overnight astronomy at the Amundsen-Scott base at the south pole, but that is changing. America's National Science Foundation has set up the Centre for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (CARA), based at the University of Chicago, to provide support for a range of projects that will allow astronomers to make use of the south pole's potential.
At the south pole observers not only get a long look at the stars; they also get a good look. At an altitude of 2,800 metres (9,300 feet), the pole is as high as many of the mountaintop observatories around the world. It is also exceedingly dry. Water in the atmosphere is an efficient absorber of radiation with wavelengths longer than those of visible light--the infra-red, sub-millimetre and millimetre regions of the spectrum--and the Antarctic atmosphere contains remarkably little water. The three programmes CARA is organising make use of this peculiar transparency.
The first, which will be partially operational later this year, is the Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy (COBRA) experiment. The cosmic microwave background is a relic of the big bang, a low of millimetre-wavelength radiation spread all over the sky. The best current measurements make it appear perfectly even; but the fact that the matter in the universe is not spread evenly implies that the big ban was, to some extent, lumpy. Finding traces of that lumpiness in the microwave background would provide information about the processes which gave the universe its structure.
The microwave background can be measured during the day, and several teams have made such measurements from the south pole during recent summers. The other two CARA projects would require astronomers to stay during the long lonely night. The Antarctic Sub-millimetre Telescope and Remote Observatory (AST/RO) will be sensitive to wavelengths of about 0.6 millimetres--wavelengths given off by carbon atoms and carbon-dioxide molecules. That radiation can be seen from other places, such as the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, but not all the time and only with great difficulty. AST/RO could methodically survey as much of the galaxy as is visible from the pole, mapping huge clouds of molecules. The South Pole Infrared Explorer (SPIREX) will look at infra-red wavelengths, taking advantage of the dryness and darkness. It also helps that at polar temperatures the structure of the telescope is cold, too, and thus does not give off much infra-red.
By 1994 COBRA, AST/RO and SPIREX should be up and running. There will, of course, be room for improvement. The first SPIREX will have a mirror only 60 centimetres across, but astronomers have plans, if everything works out, to build a 2.5 metre telescope. To help this planning, CARA is making precise measurements of the polar atmosphere and the visual conditions it provides, to find out exactly how suitable the south pole is for making all sorts of observations.
While CARA builds up its programme, other types of observation are already going on. The South Pole Air Shower Experiment is an American and British detector that consists of boxes arranged over the snowscape. When a cosmic ray--an enormously energetic particle given off by some distant cataclysm--hits the earth's atmosphere the energy released creates a shower of secondary particles, some of which reach the earth's surface. When these particles pass through the boxes, they are detected. The advantage of doing this work at the south pole is that the objects in the sky neither rise nor set, so rays from the same object always pass through the same amount of air on their way to the detector.
This is not the only way to study cosmic rays. One telescope at the south pole, built by scientists at the University of Wisconsin and Purdue University in Indiana, is destined to pick up the light emitted by cosmic rays as they crash through the atmosphere. In a vacuum the speed of light is unsurpassable; but inside a gas, a liquid or a solid light has to slow down. Under these conditions it is possible for a particle to travel faster than light. When it does so, it gives off a cone of blue light called Cerenkov radiation, analogous to the sonic boom caused by a supersonic aircaft. The telescope is designed to detect the shock wave of light caused by a cosmic ray and its secondaly particles breaking the atmosphere's speed limit; it is at the south pole to take advantage of the long periods of unsullied darkness.
The traditional way of studying cosmic rays is to get at them before they destroy themselves in the atmosphere, by using high-altitude balloons. Again, Antarctica offers advantages. A balloon launched on the Antarctic coast in summer will circle the continent on its stratospheric peripherique of winds for as much as a fortnight. Anywhere else in the world, it would cross continents and oceans in that time. It will also stay at a constant altitude over Antarctica; there is no change in temperature between day and night to make it rise and fall.
The scientists have more plans, including quite exotic ones (see box). (Box omitted) And they have ideas for a new base as well. Many of the astronomers bitten by the Antarctic bug would like to go to a site called Dome A, the highest point on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. There the altitude is over 4,000 metres, and it is colder and drier than the pole. To build a base there, though, would cost a lot. Air pressure is low in Antarctica, so being at Dome A is like being on top of a mountain over 5,000 metres high. A base there would have to be pressurised. According to John Lynch, who looks after Antarctic astronomy for the National Science Foundation, the base might cost roughly $50m.
That is big money by the standards of astronomy, and Antarctic astronomy is of interest to only a small minority of astronomers. Even if the cost of the base were to be shared by astronomers across the world, it might still prove too high. But there is another, far richer, constituency that could be interested. A pre-fabricated, hermetically sealed base in Antarctica would have much in common with a moon base. These days, one of the most cited reasons for going to the moon is to do astronomy; the airless moon, with its fortnight-long nights, is even less congenial than Antarctica, and even better suited to astronomy. To find out how to run a lunar observatory--which might well be international, too--it would make sense to try running an Antarctic one designed as a test bed. That way astronomers at the last place on earth could prepare themselves to work at the first place off it."

On February 20th a panel set up by America's Food and Drug Administration advised the FDA that there was no clear evidence the devices were unsafe--but that they were not clearly safe, either. So the panel recommended that implants get the benefit of the doubt and not be banned, while rigorous attempts are made to clear up the issue once and for all. To get more data, the panel envisages turning the whole implant industry into a vast clinical study to test the safety of its wares. If the FDA takes this advice, which it probably will, it may quieten the charges and counter-charges that have tied these products up in a knot of lawsuits and scientific debates-often acrimonious ones.
Still, the three days of public hearings that preceded the recommendation could hardly have filled anyone with confidence if they were already partially filled with silicone. Considering that implants have been sold since 1963 and have been used by perhaps 2m women in America, 1m in the past ten years, it has to be unsettling that the honest answer to dozens of questions about them is ""no one knows for sure"". Such simple matters as how long implants can be expected to withstand the pressures of being hugged are fraught with uncertainties. And many of the unresolved issues are far more complex.
It has yet to be determined how the silicone gel that inevitably ""bleeds"" out of an implant's core interacts with the different silicone formula in its outer shell, and what these chemicals may do to the capsule of scar tissue the body creates around the entire device. These scar-tissue capsules, which normally keep the implant isolated from the rest of the body, will leak if ruptured. The rate at which this happens is unknown. It is sometimes brought about deliberately, though, by surgeons trying to combat ""capsular contracture"". This complication, in which the scar tissue shrinks, results in breasts that feel more like stone than flesh, and can become deformed.
Once the silicone escapes the breast, no one knows what it does. But critics have their suspicions. They talk of higher-than-normal rates of a variety of disorders: chronic 'flu-ike illness, poor short-term memory, fatigue, general weakness and immune-system damage which might manifest itself as scleroderma or rheumatoid arthritis.
Although about 20% of the implants are used for ""reconstruction"", normally following cancer surgery, the rest are for ""augmentation""--enlarging the otherwise healthy breasts of women who think them too small. These women clearly feel they are getting a benefit they value, since they pay for it, but they may face more risks than patients having reconstructive surgery. Augmentation requires two implants, and most of the people who choose it are under 35 years old when they have the operation. That is far younger than usual for reconstruction, which means the women have longer to develop complications. It also means that they are more likely to get pregnant and breast-feed after the implants, have been fitted--which may be safe, but that is another unknown.
Whatever problems the implants may cause, there is no doubt that they also obscure others. Mammograms designed to find early signs of breast cancer miss more cancers in implant wearers than in those without implants. Some mammographic techniques can partially compensate for this--and they should be used in any case, because ordinary mammography entails compression of the breasts, which has been known to crack the scar tissue around the implants. But these techniques are more costly than routine screening; they can be done only by specially trained technicians and involve greater exposure to x-rays. Using mammograms to monitor implants for leaks and defects requires higher doses still. Ultrasound may prove to be an alternative, but that is not yet proven.
As a precaution, the FDA recommends that women with implants see a doctor regularly. That has its cost. Reconstruction patients who have health insurance can usually count on it to help from the outset. Not so patients who get the implants for augmentation. More often than not, these women must bear the full cost not only of the initial surgery--typically $2,000-6,000--but also of any related after-care.
Research to tackle the unanswered questions is now getting under way, paid for by the implant manufacturers. It could have been done years ago, if they had not chosen to keep quiet about what they did and did not know about the risks. There might now be implants with fewer shortcomings than the present ones, which have changed little in their fundamentals during nearly 30 years.
While the science of implants has stood still, though, the business has boomed. Apart from liposuction (the removal of fat), nothing has been generating more business for America's plastic surgeons than the insertion of breast implants. Between 1965 and 1989, while breast augmentation was becoming popular, the number of doctors specialising in plastic surgery more than quadrupled. Their training is heavily subsidised by taxpayers through Medicare payments to teaching hospitals, and their average income is over $200,000 a year, higher than that of most other specialists. if demand for breast implants now falls, perhaps some of them will look at other specialities, and more doctors will find themselves forced into the understaffed and presently less remunerative area of healing the sick."

For those who hunt these elusive particles, the clarity and dryness of the Antarctic skies are of no consequence. The pure ice a kilometre below them, though, is just what they want.
Neutrinos, produced in various nuclear processes, are stand-offish particles capable of passing through a planet without let or hindrance. But they sometimes interact with atoms. When that happens the neutrinos can, if energetic enough, create other particles, which, moving at high speed, give off telltale Cerenkov light. This is what the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) is meant to pick up. When completed, it will consist of a set of strings carrying photomultiplier tubes. The strings will be lowered down boreholes drilled with pressurised hot water. Then the photomultiplier tubes will be frozen in place roughly a kilometre below the surface, where the ice is clear and free of bubbles.
Most of the trillions of neutrinos that will stream through AMANDA every second will leave no trace at all. But when one deigns to interact with an atom and create a muon, the photomultipliers will pick up the tiny burst of Cerenkov light given off, and the monitors on the surface will be able to infer the direction the neutrino came from. That will allow them to work out where the sources of the high energy neutrinos are, and whether they correspond to objects already discovered by more conventional astronomical techniques, like black holes and neutron stars.
In all such experiments, the important thing is to get rid of distractions. On this score, the ice does AMANDA proud. There appears to be no radioactivity in its pitch-black depths. There are still, though, particles created by cosmic rays streaming down--which is why AMANDA'S eyes look down, not up. Any particle rising from the centre of the earth must have come all the way through it. That means it is a neutrino.
Similar neutrino telescopes are being touted for other sites. The Deep Underwater Muon and Neutrino Detector (DUMAND), which has been planned for years, would involve strings of tubes like AMANDA'S, but rising from the floor of the Pacific off the shore of Hawaii, rather than dangling into the Antarctic ice. There is also a European neutrino telescope under discussion which would sit in a flooded Italian quarry. Some low-energy-neutrino detectors are already running, but they are concentrating only on the sun.
At present, AMANDA looks extremely promising. A test run last month showed that the strings can work, and also revealed a non-scientific fringe benefit; the reservoir of hot water used to drill the holes can double as an open-air hot tub if the wind is not too cold, which provides a pleasant novelty at the pole. If the scientists at the University of California and the University of Wisconsin who have come up with AMANDA can get the money together, a three-string prototype could be set up this December for perhaps $250,000. If that works, then they will be in a position to apply for the money needed for the full 50-string array, and get a new view of the sky through the bulk of the earth."

It is a ritual incantation of Chinese officials and many China-watchers alike that China is a socialist state. In reality, more than half the Chinese economy is no longer in state hands and the private share of the economy has been growing rapidly, even since the Beijing massacre of June 1989. It is also customary to repeat that China is a unified country. Yet economic reforms are rapidly creating effectively independent kingdoms, especially in coastal China.
It is helpful to keep in mind this rowing gap between rhetoric and reality, because the real China is far more transparent and likely to be a pragmatic partner. W.J.F. Jenner stresses the depths of the Chinese, and the serious risks that a decentralising China might become a disintegrating China. Both Harry Harding and Nicholas Lardy are far less cataclysmic as they demonstrate just how much China can be cajoled and sometime jolted into becoming more open and co-operative. If the worry is about China as an arms merchant, then take comfort from the fact that a China in fear of a unipolar world dominated by the United States will join talks about arms control. If it is China's trade policies that rate, there is plenty of evidence that wielding a big stick (when you have one) makes China far more cooperative.
Even on human rights, China may cling to its claim that this is an internal matter, but the reality is that a form of hostage trading takes place: dissidents are released as ""gifts"" to visiting foreign dignitaries. Similarly, last year China managed to present its agreement to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a gift to the Japanese prime minister, and then made the same gift to the visiting American secretary of state. These are just some of the most recent examples of trends identified in Mr Harding's penetrating study. Tough-minded American diplomacy can moderate Chinese behaviour, and indeed is all the more necessary in the post-cold-war world. If the new order is to involve a more active United Nations and greater controls on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and conventional arms, then China, with its power to wreak havoc, cannot be left outside the system.
Mr Lardy looks at the narrower issue of Chinese trade policy, but in the process uncovers the best kept secret of post-1989 China--that the country is now further along the road from Marx to the market. The conventional view that China is a communist system doomed to fail like its comrades in Europe is wrong, if only because, at least in economic terms, vast parts of the Chinese economy are already in private hands. China has achieved some of the highest rates of economic and foreign-trade growth in the East Asian region because it has adopted market mechanisms and encouraged the investment of foreign capital. It is also implicit in Mr Lardy's study that, because only parts of China have benefited from these trends, the country is increasingly divided between regions with different levels of prosperity and (inversely related) under different degrees of central control. This gives them distinct ways of looking at the world, not to mention diverse trade and investment patterns.
China's party chiefs worry that the outside world is bent on achieving the ""peaceful evolution"" of the Chinese system away from socialism. They are absolutely right. But in this case it is in the interests of most of those who do business with China to deny the reality. The logic of the play-it-tough school of Sinologists suggests that China should be encouraged to respond to the collapse of the Soviet Union and its ideology by speeding up economic reform. The loner that reform goes on, the more amenable China maybe to international co-operation and, in the longer term, to political change.
Mr Jenner reminds his readers that China has tried and failed in the past to adapt to pressures from outside; in the 1920s, the result was a nasty bout of warlordism. China's condition in the 1990s is not quite so dire, but it is unlikely that change will happen smoothly. It may be true that an increasing number of Chinese have a great deal to lose from a reversal of reform; but if evolution proves bumpier than planned, it could mean more than one China."

A bit of travel, a touch of history, some rum, some religion, some rancid food. Ian Thomson is the old-fashioned sort of travelling raconteur who writes it all down as he goes along, without much organising principle. But then Haiti is stuck back in the days when that was the way travel books were done. The style fits the island, and Mr Thomson brings it to life, stink and all. Haiti is not large but it is remarkably hard to get about in. There are no roads at all in many districts. Mr Thomson walked there, and intrepidly found his way to offshore islands in the sort of ragged craft that, these days, take off laden with desperate people to the open sea, in the hope that the United States Coastguard will rescue them before they founder.
Physical remoteness means that many Haitians have no sense of their nation as a community. History divides them even more. A local Marxist told the author: ""Haiti as a nation does not exist. We are all of us in transit, without a home."" So it has always been. A group of mulatto officers, rebelling in 1849 against the black emperor, Faustin Soulouque, wrote: ""Haiti is our country and does not belong to the dirty negroes. The sooner they learn this is Europe and not Africa the better."" But it is America after all, an America gone crazy.
This newspaper noted a few years ago that the poorest nation of the Americas is not badly off by the standards of other continents, with its GNP per head right in the middle of Africa's range, between Kenya's and Ghana's. But Haiti lacks Africa's resilience. Transported, their skills and their traditions suppressed to turn them into docile labour, its people were thrust two centuries ago into a mockery of self-rule and were unable to devise a culture of their own.
Their religion is a farce, raged scraps of Christian practice and shards of African observance boiled into the mishmash known as voodoo, and served by houngan and bokor practitioners who mostly collaborated with the Duvaliers' bloody regime. Mr Thomson reports what they say and do, without falling into the outsider's trap of assuming that, because people follow them, they deserve to be followed. He meets weary Catholic missionaries from the pages of Graham Greene, and far-out American sectarians brining charity without understanding. All are rivals, instilling distrust rather than solidarity.
Language has fallen apart. People from one end of Haiti can barely understand the patois of the other. Perhaps one Haitian in five has some grasp of reading; but what they read is increasingly useless. American pseudo-scholars devised, and have imposed, a convention for transcribing Haitian creole that is phonetic only if the reader gives the letters English values. Haitians are told to write Se pa fot mwen when they actually say C'est pasfaute mienne. It is not their fault, indeed, that literacy in French, the official language, grows rarer.
Haiti's sole organising principle is terror. By terror the Duvaliers and their heirs ruled; the president-in-exile, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, seems ready to bless terror if he gets the power he was elected to exercise.
Left to themselves, Haitians would no doubt in due time find salvation their own way. But hunger and terror drive them to flee in crazy boats towards better-managed countries, whose defenders turn them back. The United States, which blamed the British for shipping home the boat people of Hong Kong, does the same to black Caribbean migrants. As for the Latin Americans, they are embarrassed by their black French-speaking neighbour, and fearful lest the apparent triumph of its latest putsch may be imitated by their own unruly soldiers.
That something should be done for Haiti is evident. But what? Propositions from anybody who has not read Mr Thomson's enlightening and profoundly depressing book are disqualified."

In all the affairs of history, there is but one Affair: that of Alfred Dreyfus, graduate of the Ecole Polytechnique, captain in the French artillery, probationary officer on the general staff, accused, condemned and imprisoned as a traitor. Too stiff and reserved to be likeable, let alone popular, Dreyfus was a natural victim. He was also a Jew.
Had he not been a Jew, there would have been no affair, or, at the very least, not one of such dimensions as to split France for over a decade into two warring factions of left and right and thereby expose the fragility of the Third Republic. In the end, justice triumphed and the Third Republic survived. But, year after year, France suffered. So did Dreyfus.
Spawned in the cesspool of anti-Semitism, the affair took on a monstrous, evil life of its own. The moral issue was plain. Either a man could and should be sacrificed for an institution, the army; or justice to the individual was paramount. The answer was clear enough, had not the affair been tainted with the poison and hysteria of anti-Semitism and had it not presented the anti-clerical Radicals and their allies with a political opportunity to triumph over their opponents on the right.
In all this, the man was forgotten. At best he was a martyr, at worst a symbol. Dreyfus himself became a secondary, almost vexatious, consideration--except to his wife, Lucie, and his brother, Mathieu. The Dreyfusards would have liked Dreyfus to have been less stoical, less bourgeois, more flamboyant. For their cause, they wanted a lion, another Gambetta. Instead they had a dignified, rather prissy cat that walked alone. Dreyfus was too stiff, too cold, too self-absorbed for their liking--or to serve their purposes. After the second court-martial, even more disgraceful than the first, Clemenceau would have preferred Dreyfus to return to prison rather than receive a presidential pardon, for that would have served the cause better.
That says a great deal about the nature of French politics at the time. It also says something about the impression that Dreyfus made on others. His photographs, from youth to old age, convey the image of a man imprisoned behind his own spectacles, locking himself away from his fellows. That is not just the stamp that four years of solitary confinement on Devil's Island put on him. It is the mark of the outsider who wanted to be on the inside but did not know how to get there. He and his wealthy Alsatian Jewish family did not merely want to be accepted by France. They wanted to be absorbed within it, with their religion (always a minor matter for them) not simply ignored but forgotten by others. It was not to be, not for the Dreyfus family and not, even more horribly, for millions of other Jews in this century.
Assimilationists and patriots to the core, Dreyfus, his family and many other Jews paid whatever debt they felt they owed to their country of adoption decently and honourably at the time of the affair and in both world wars. Michael Burns's meticulous, sometimes over-detailed but absorbing account of the family's history begins with Alfred's great-grandfather, a kosher butcher and small moneylender in Alsace. It ends with Alfred's granddaughter, a member of the Resistance, dying of typhus in Auschwitz. It encapsulates the history of the Jews in France. It is a story of suffering nobly borne. It could have been written only by a committed Dreyfusard. But who today, looking back on the evils of a century of anti-Semitism. does not take Dreyfus's side?"

Truth in the communist half of Europe was often stranger than fiction. This was the region of the absurd, the distorted and the grotesque--where the main newspaper was called Pravda (the Truth) and was full of lies. Maybe only a work of fiction can do justice to this peculiar reality. Certainly, among the many books about Eastern Europe to be written since communism started to break up in 1989, ""Stalin's Nose"" stands out: this was no ordinary part of the world, and Rory Maclean's is no ordinary journey through it.
It is a Gogolesque tour in a Trabant, from East Berlin to Moscow (though the Trabi makes it only as far as Romania). For company, there is a pig called Winston and an aunt called Zita. Zita was an Austrian aristocrat who married into the region's new aristocracy, the communist nomenklatura. Zita sets the tone--at once eccentric, amusing and chilling--and her connections stretch across half a continent. In every city she has a sister, cousin, comrade or former servant. Through this cast, each country and its gruesome recent past come to life.
In Zita's company, there is never a dull moment. The reader learns to expect the extraordinary. In Prague the travellers are joined by a coffin (it contains Zita's brother-in-law, a Czech RAF pilot killed in the second world war but never given a proper burial). In Budapest Zita is given a chunk of the statue of Stalin destroyed in the 1956 revolution (whence the book's title). But such things are no more extraordinary than some of the real events described en route: Auschwitz, the destruction of Warsaw while the Russians stood and watched, the building of he Berlin Wall, the suppression of the Prague Spring.
The border-line between fear and farce is disturbingly narrow. Take Lenin. The travellers meet a technician who looked after Lenin's embalmed body and succeeds in reversing its decay. Confronted with the pressing problem of preserving Lenin for posterity, Soviet science rises to its world-beating best. The technician pioneers an electric-shock treatment, with spectacular results: ""But the first time we tried it I overestimated the power needed. Lenin suddenly sat up from the table, his arms shook and his lips started to quiver. I thought he was going to speak. It was quite a shock. After that we reduced the voltage.""
The past pervades the journey. Everybody's life has been cruelly corrupted or distorted. The memory of what happened 20 or 50 years ago is as well-preserved as the body of Zita's brother-in-law. For Zita herself, the journey becomes catharsis. In facing up to her past, she finds herself. For the comfortable western reader it is a witty, perceptive tour through the unlucky half of Europe. But, lest the reader laugh too loudly, he is reminded (shades of Gogol to the end) that he is also laughing at himself. Everybody feels the burden of this appalling past."

Thirty years old this year, with yet another E.M. Forster adaptation (""Howard's End"") in the offing, this most uncommon film unit has become synonymous with good taste in a business not noted for it.
So much so, in fact, that a backlash has now set in. Yes, Merchant Ivory movies (such as ""A Room with a View"" and ""The Bostonians"") are the acme of polish and sophistication. Yes, they carry off the difficult trick of filming distinguished novelists (Forster and Henry James) as if they had written directly for the screen. But are delicacy, refinement and an air of gracious living enough?
The question is especially relevant now because the film of ""Howard's End"" is so good. From Forster's finest novel, producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory and scriptwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala have fashioned their finest film. Everything that is memorable about the novel--the large cast of varied characters, the biting social satire and the use of property as a metaphor for who shall inherit England--is there on the screen, interpreted in ensemble playing that is outstanding even by Merchant Ivory standards.
Yet doubts remain. Should not artists have something of their own to contribute, beyond tasteful adaptation? In Robert Bresson's ""Journal d'un Cure de Campagne"", Mr Bresson probes so deeply into the soul of Georges Bernanos's tortured priest that his film becomes a work of art in its own right. In the same way, Luis Bunuel's ""Nazarin"" ceases to be simply a film version of Benito Perez Galdos's novel and becomes an apologia for Bunuel's own atheism. In both these films, the directors turn the source material into extensions of their own personalities. Mr Ivory never does that; he is simply faithful.
More than that, he depends on a good script, which usually means one by Mrs Jhabvala. As a novelist of some distinction, she has a knack for dramatising the work of others. Without her, Mr Ivory flounders. When she was unable to do the honours for the Merchant Ivory production of ""Maurice"", Mr Ivory wrote the screenplay himself with some help from Kit Hesketh-Harvey. It proved the weakest of the Forster adaptations.
German born, educated in England and married to an Indian, Mrs Jhabvala has, over the years, been as important to Merchant Ivory as its leading lights--the dynamic Indian entrepreneur Mr Merchant, who acts as producer, and Mr Ivory, the quiet American who calls the shots. In the acclaim that has accrued to the company's Forster and James adaptations, it is sometimes forgotten that there are other strings to its bow.
Merchant Ivory began as a partnership by filming the work of Mrs Jhabvala. She wrote its first four films--three originals (""Shakespeare Wallah"", ""The Guru"" and ""Bombay Talkie"") and one adaptation of an existing work (""The Householder""). All told, she has now written 15 scripts for them, including a version of her own novel ""Heat and Dust"". These films mark the Indian side of Merchant Ivory--a side close to the style of Satyajit Ray, who edited and wrote the music for ""The Householder"".
There is also a third strand, American in flavour and partly reflecting the fact that Mrs Jhabvala now lives and works in New York. ""Roseland"", three stories set in a New York dance hall, ""Mr and Mrs Bridge"" and ""Jane Austen in Manhattan"", another script written for television, are of this kind. So, too, are ""Savages"" and ""Slaves of New York"", both subjects that the company developed independently of Mrs Jhabvala.
All this and more is set out in a new celebratory book on ""The Films of Merchant Ivory"" by Robert Emmet Lon (Viking; L30). It is particularly good on the company's financial background. The earlier (Indian) films, for example, were paid for out of frozen rupees that Columbia and Twentieth Century Fox could see no other way of spending. Nor would the best of Merchant Ivory ever have happened but for Jacob (now Lord) Rothschild. It was he who had the vision to bail them out when they ran into difficulties at the time of ""Heat and Dust"" (the script had been sent back with the brusque comment ""We are returning Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's ""Eat My Dust"").
Mr Lon's informative book suffers a little from a compulsion to say good things about the films and to unite them into a coherent philosophy. In truth, however, Mr Ivory (like David Lean) is no more or less than a metteur-en-scene--as good or as bad as his material. What he does have is an instinct not just for the good, but for the superlative."

The director-general of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage in Rome, Francesco Sisinni, no less, was given a two-month suspended sentence (which, as a first offender, he will not have to serve). The others sentenced with him, also to suspended terms, were his ministry's local representatives, plus two members of the municipal government.
The Piazza della Signoria still exists. The issue that brought the seven men to court was the new pavement of the large square, which no one likes. The court accepted the concept that the pavement is an integral part of the monumental square--which is listed, as is St Mark's Square in Venice. Mr Sisinni argued that the pavement was not integral to the square at all, but a mere piece of topography.
Fifteen years ago the city fathers decided that the square's 10,065 flagstones, originally laid down around 1780, had to be replaced. A Florence newspaper, La Nione, held a referendum to see what kind of repaving everybody wanted. In the late 13th century, the square had been paved with cotto--a kind of unglazed terracotta brick, much used in ""typical"" flooring for the city's grander palaces.
At least three paintings exist of the square with its cotto bricks, which were bordered with a geometric design of white marble. The most famous of these paintings shows Gerolamo Savonarola, who had been the city's dictator for a while, and two fellow Dominican friars being roasted on a pyre in the middle of the square in 1498. This was appropriate enough, for it was in this very square that Savonarola had staged many of his bonfires of the vanities, encouraging even Botticelli to burn some of his pictures there. Florentines voted in favour of bringing back the bricks--and a note of colour in the mostly grey square would have been welcomed.
The Ministry of Cultural Heritage then let it be known that the bricks would not be considered. The square was to be redone with the grey, irregularly hand-hewn stones of pietra serena, as in 1780. But that did not happen either. Instead, the square has been paved with rectangular machine-cut stones and, when work was completed in 1990, the kindest comment made by Florentines was the city now had a suitable roller-skating rink. Local artists, poets and writers said that square had been ""offended and insulted""; and Giorgio Saviane, a novelist, said last week that the sentences imposed on those responsible were ""too mild"". He as still dreams of red bricks.
The sentences are without precedent. It is the first time that a penal court has ruled on a question of art. The ministry prefers to define such matters as ""technical and scientific"", the sort of thing which only its own officers are competent to decide. The public prosecutor thought otherwise, telling the court that ""we are not here to discuss only the square itself, but the destiny of all the things that the civilisation of our ancestors left us.""
One mystery remains. During the six years of work, each of the old stones was painted with a number and carted off, to be used again if possible. Those stones seem to have vanished. The story goes that a custodian sold them to builders of new villas outside Florence, and that they now decorate the borders of swimming pools and driveways.
Presumably, in another generation, no one will remember what the square once looked like, unless they see a cassette of James Ivory's film ""A Room with a View"". Meanwhile, Florentines are being advised to tread on the damned new stones as much as possible, in the hope that their ugliness can eventually be stamped out."

As new publications reveal more of the art and life of Alfred Cortot, one of the greatest French pianists, questions inevitably arise about whether a musician owes something not just to composers, but also to his fellow musicians.
Cortot was a masterly interpreter of the romantics, as shown by three new compact discs of his performances of Schumann (Biddulph LHW 003, 004, 005). He also formed the first professional trio at the turn of the century, with Pablo Casals on cello and Jacques Thibaud on violin; their wonderful reading of the Haydn piano trio in G has also just been re-released (Biddulph LAB 028). And Cortot was a gifted conductor, whose premiere of Wagner's ""Gotterdammerung"" in France in 1904 caused such a crush that Debussy, then a music critic, could not manage to fight his way into the hall.
Add to that over half a century of teaching, and Cortot's importance to music seems to justify the extraordinary recognition his work still receives. Yet a shadow remains over his activities during the German occupation of France, and these have received new attention with the recent publication by Seghers of the journals of Jacques Copeau, a legendary theatre director and friend of Andre Gide.
After the Germans marched into Paris, Copeau was fired from his job as head of the Comedie Francaise because of ""his lack of enthusiasm for the anti-Semitic measures"" of the Vichy government. Hence his dismay to read in a newspaper, on June 11th 1942,
that Alfred Cortot recently gave a concert in Berlin, at the Philharmonic Hall, that won him from a packed house...first an ovation, endless applause, and I believe plenty of money. Whatever one's ideas on collaboration, on the outcome of the war, the future status of Europe and the world, I find that such displays are indefensible...it's a baseness that ties you to the chariot of the victor. These artists accept what a very base woman, Cleopatra, refused: to appear at Caesar's triumph.
After Jews were banned from employment in Germany in 1933, many of the world's greatest musicians were invited to play with the Berlin Philharmonic. Casals refused, saying he would play only when all musicians were free to play in Germany. Thibaud, using Gallic irony, said he would gladly come if he might play a concerto by a banned Jewish conductor, Bruno Walter. But Cortot, after at first refusing, decided the next year to accept the invitation, and went on doing so.
He enjoyed evident privileges at home: EMI has just re-released a large selection of the Chopin recordings he made in 1942 and 1943, when recording was cut to a minimum (EMI CZS 767 3592). But his collaboration hurt him afterwards. Casals, a violent anti-fascist who voluntarily retired from public performance to show his opposition to Franco, would not think of reuniting for chamber music with Cortot; the great ensemble, disbanded in 1933, had no reunions. As Bronislaw Humberman put it when he refused in that year to play the violin with the Berlin Orchestra, ""It's not a question of concertos or even of Jews. It's a question of the most elementary principle of our European civilisation--the freedom of the individual."""

Blissful dawns are treacherous in France, a time when people become bedazzled by a fashionable idea. That bring trouble, for French politics moves repeatedly through a cycle of bliss, folly, wisdom and boredom. In 11 years the government of Franois Mitterrand has been through the first three and is now in the boredom phase. Mr Mitterrand, once a bird of dawn, has become a bedraggled bird of the evening. When will the next bliss come? And with what impact on the world?
It is already a decade since the euphoria surrounding the election of Mr Mitterrand was starting to fade. He had become president in May 1981, committed to making France a model socialist state beyond the wishy-washy mixed economies of European social democracy. His election produced a brief spell of hope and bonhomie in France. Even the young rich drank to the new dawn--with their parents unaccountably away in Switzerland. But it did not take the world's currency markets long to shy at the folly of heavy state spending and nationalisation. During 1982 they pushed Mr Mitterrand into one of the wisest U-turns in Europe this century.
The president has stuck to his changed course, albeit with diminishing enthusiasm. The result is that France is today an odd place to find loom. In 1982 gross national product per Frenchman was $16,000 (in today's dollars); now it is $22,000. Yet a fortnight ago a packed stadium in Albertville, celebrating the closing of the winter Olympics, gratuitously booed the prime minister, Edith Cresson, for her mere presence. The crowd then streamed home in fleets of ultra-fast trains or along motorways built from scratch in months--the work of a government that boasts a boringly respectable macroeconomic policy and an inflation rate lower than Germany's. Some talk of the ""second-trolley syndrome"" (le malaise du aeuxime caddy) the unease felt when the first supermarket trolley is crammed, but the second one is still empty.
There are less decadent reasons for the political malaise. The French have been particularly affected by the ending of the cold war and the reunification of Germany. These changes have required France to reconsider its Gaullist go-it-alone defence policy. They have altered the nature of the European Community, the centrepiece of France's foreign policy, by giving Germany greater pride and influence, and by creating a sudden need to expand the EC'S membership eastwards.
Inside France, too, the political game is changing. The demise of communism has taken the excitement out of the set-piece of French politics--centre-left versus centre-right, with the two hard to tell apart. The top politicians have been around for too long. The centre-right is split. Cronyism, and corruption in the financing of parties, have become ever more evident.
Add a disturbing level of unemployment (9.8% generally, 16% among the young), together with an overdone fear of immigrants with unFrench ways, and the result is constant complaint that the main parties are out of touch with the people. So when, on March 22nd, elections are held for the governments of France's 22 regions, a big protest is expected. Opinion polls suggest that half the voters will abstain, and that, of the rest, a third or more will vote either for Jean-Marie Le Pen's xenophobic National Front or for various shades of green. Enthusiasm for environmentalism, in a country that long prided itself on the world's most ambitious nuclear-power programme, shows up France's political restlessness. An old French yearning is back-for a new leader on a white charger to arrive, waving a fresh banner.
The problem is that Mr Mitterrand's term as president has three more years to run, which may mean three more years for the restlessness to grow. And if the regional elections turn out as expected, he will be under intense pressure to ""do something"". The restlessness--or that something--will have an impact far beyond France. It will shape the institutions of the post-coldwar world. Within Europe, France will do much to determine the openness, inside and out, of a European Community that is still struggling to become one market. Beyond Europe, France's position on agricultural reform will decide whether the GATT round of trade talks succeeds or fails. Within the West, it will help determine whether the Atlantic alliance has life after the Soviet Union. If any Frenchman fears that France has been marginalised by recent upheavals, he can rest assured. France holds more sway over the world order today than it did in 1981.
CARPE DIEM
Few people expect Mr Mitterrand to make dramatic changes. He is not about to turn his back on the European Community or to return France to the protectionist and state-commanded economy that he briefly championed. The most plausible guess is that he will try to muddle through, perhaps replacing Mrs Cresson as prime minister with someone from his current team, to give the feel of a fresh start (see page 49). Meanwhile, he will cynically prepare to bring back proportional representation for the parliamentary election due in 1993. This could well deny the centre-right opposition parties their expected majority. The president would thus spend his last two years in cohabitation with a coalition--a recipe for indecision.
This is a depressing prospect, for indecision will cause damage. It will block the GATT round, spoil some of the good that Europe's 1992 market will do for its members and would-be members, and leave Europe's defence arrangements in morale-sapping limbo.
What France and the world need from Mr Mitterrand is the courage to press on with the unfinished revolution in France's style of government that his U-turn started. Such resolve would start by rejecting the misguided relapse towards protectionism and industrial-meddling embodied in Mrs Cresson and her Rasputin, Abel Farnoux. A revived Mr Mitterrand would then go on to reduce the costly promises of the state's health, social security and pension systems, spreading their burden away from the lower paid. He would end the pretence that he can improve the lot of undertrained workers by raising the minimum wage that keeps some of them out of work. He would get on with selling state-owned companies, starting with Usinor Sacilor, Elf-Aquitaine, Banque Nationale de Paris and Rhone-Poulenc (see page 74). He would push the decentralisation of French government, which he started, to its logical conclusion, so that each level of local government was clearly responsible for its own financial affairs.
Looking abroad, the president would embrace instead of shun the plans of the European Commission to reform the common agricultural policy, realising that these could actually help left-voting French smallholders at the expense of grain-barons who vote with the right. He would challenge NATO to redefine its role and structures in a post-cold-war world, saying that France's armed forces could be ready to play a full European part in a revamped alliance.
To make this relaunch both credible and exciting, Mr Mitterrand would need a new prime minister. Ideally, he would persuade Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, to take the job. Mr Delors has the clout to seize the considerable powers that the French prime minister has but rarely uses. As French finance minister, he was the architect of the U-turn of 1982, and his work in Brussels has given him
feel for France's international responsibilities. He could groom himself to succeed Mr Mitterrand in 1995. Opinion polls already show him to be by far the most popular candidate for the presidency.
Even if offered the prime-ministerial change, Mr Delors would probably refuse it. He already has a job that keeps him powerfully in the public eye, and his term in Brussels may well be extended until the end of 1994. He may prefer to bide his time rather than accept the doubtful privilege of working with a shopworn president towards a tough parliamentary election next year. If Mr Delors say; no, Mr Mitterrand's most likely choice would be Pierre Beregovoy, the doughty finance minister who has done good work in curbing Mrs Cresson's wilder schemes. He has the right instincts to restart France's liberal revolution, but he has no novelty value for a bored electorate. The French need that knight on a white charger now. Given three more years of tetchiness, who knows what nationalist bliss they might go for?"
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224137210/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/2?accountid=14657,"In all the world there is no more striking a case of opportunity squandered than India. For decades a breathtakingly inept approach to economic policy--one that contrived to make even less sense than communist central planning--separated the country from the world economy, held back growth and defeated progress on almost any measure you choose. An economy whose potential in the 1950s stood comparison with that of the East Asian tigers, on a much larger scale, remained mired in poverty.
Last year a new government embarked on a programme of economic reform, partly out of financial necessity, partly out of conviction. If carried through, the reforms will deliver India the prosperity it has been denied. Predictably, they have encountered fierce opposition. Many of India's politicians and intellectuals prefer ideological purity and poverty (for others) to progress tainted by capitalism. So loud were their protests that the pace of reform seemed bound to slacken, or worse. That is why the government's second budget, on February 29th, is so encouraging. Much remains to be done, and the difficulties can hardly be exaggerated; but, marvelous to report, India is still on the path of reform.
THE SURPRISING MR SINGH
On two fronts, the budget was bolder than expected (see page 33). First, Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has taken big steps to open the economy to trade and foreign investment. Foreign-exchange controls have been further liberalised with the partial floating of the rupee; tariffs have been cut from a maximum of 150% to 110%, with some capital goods facing tariffs as low as 30%; eligible foreign investors will be allowed to invest in India's stockmarkets; and foreign investment in the production of oil and gas, formerly reserved for India's public sector, will henceforth be actively sought.
Liberalisation of this sort is timid by the standards of more celebrated third-world reformers--Mexico's, say. By Indian standards, it is startling. For years the outside world and its rapacious capitalists were regarded as the enemies of economic development. At last the government has acknowledged that India cannot go it alone. ""We must not remain captives of a fear of the East India Company,"" says Mr Singh. ""Indian industry has come of age and is now ready to ... compete with foreign industry and co-operate with it.""
The budget is surprisingly bold in another way, too. Mr Singh's most urgent task was to reduce public borrowing. This is essential if inflation is to fall from its present 12%. But to do it Mr Singh has not raised taxes; indeed, he has cut them, and in ways offensive to socialist sensibilities. (The top rate of personal-income tax will fall from 50% to 40%, and financial assets will be exempted from the wealth tax.) Instead, he aims to reduce borrowing by curbing public expenditure. He will not have to look far. India's vast array of subsidies and support for state-owned enterprises offers ample scope for cuts. But any such savings are bound to be controversial. It remains to be seen whether Mr Singh can secure them.
For the moment the minister's opponents are concentrating, as tradition requires, on the threat the reforms pose to Indian sovereignty. A row has blown up over the conditions that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have set in return for new loans, conditions the budget sought to meet. The government has promised to publish a report on its pre-budget discussions with the World Bank. This is unlikely to help Mr Singh. The report can hardly deny that India, on the verge of defaulting on its debts, was obliged to deal with the international institutions, and is therefore bound to enrage the country's leftist reactionaries. To them, it counts for nothing that the changes are desirable in any case.
If Mr Singh survives this immediate charge of betrayal, his next and greatest test will be to accelerate the restructuring of India's domestic economy. This is the biggest gap in his programme so far. India has many bloated state-owned enterprises and thousands of officially designated ""sick industries""--firms that are chronic loss-makers, but are required to stay in business in order to protect jobs. The subsidies and soft credit fed to these firms are the main causes of, respectively, the budget deficit and a crisis-to-be in the financial system. Opening India to trade and investment is essential, but this policy can succeed only to the extent that it changes the pattern of production. If the change is sweeping, the economy as a whole will thrive, and some of India's firms will become world leaders. But a great many enterprises must be allowed to close. The cost of avoiding those closures is to cripple the rest.
The government deserves, and is getting generous support for its new policies. If Mr Singh and his reformers can stay the course, India will astonish the world--and itself."

A Security Council deadline passes. The UN threatens Iraq with ""serious consequences"". America says it has the authority to use force. Tariq Aziz is summoned for an 11th-hour negotiation. Sounds familiar? All of these things have happened in the past fortnight. Is it possible, Desert Storm notwithstanding, that in the Gulf the beginning of 1992 will end up being depressingly similar to the beginning of 1991?
Not really. Before last year's war the world faced a vast challenge in the Gulf. Iraq had swallowed up Kuwait and assembled an army on the borders of Saudi Arabia. Mr. Hussein's war machine towered over his neighbours, and his defiance of America won him admirers throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds. All that has changed. Kuwait is pumping oil again, the remnant of Mr. Hussein's army is a threat mainly to his own citizens, and his air force hardly exists. Foreign admirers, disenchanted by his failure in war and by his post-war cruelty at home, have melted away. Unless he is still building a bomb in his basement, he no longer tops the world's list of worries. That, in a queer way, is the trouble.
THE LAW OF DIMINISHING ALARMS
When Mr Hussein loomed over the Gulf, it was relatively easy to summon up the will to oppose him. Now that he is deflated, it is easier not to care about his continuing delinquencies. Since Iraq poses no immediate threat to the region or the world, runs the argument for not caring, Mr. Hussein can be allowed to stew in his own juice. In the foulness of time, economic sanctions will do their thing, Mr. Hussein will fall from power, and joy will be unconfined.
This beguiling argument is wrong on at least two counts, the first of which is humanitarian. That a year and a half of sanctions has failed to bring around the Iraqi regime does not prove that another spell will fail too. But continued failure is all too possible, and it is not Mr Hussein but his wretched people who are stewing in the dictator's juice. In recent months Mr Hussein has imposed a blockade on the Kurdish ""haven"" in the north of the country and continued a brutal campaign against the Shia resistance in the south. He refuses to accept the international supervision that would allow Iraq to sell some oil, earn some foreign change and so reduce the general suffering. The status quo may be dandy for people seated comfortably in New York, Washington or London. But it exacts a high price every day from millions of innocent Iraqis.
A second defect in the do-nothing argument involves Mr Hussein's breaches of the terms of the ceasefire. For more than a year, Iraq has systematically flouted the main provisions of Resolution 687, which ended the war. Iraq was supposed to allow the UN to dismantle its illegal nuclear-weapons programme and to destroy its medium-range ballistic missiles. Instead, it has tried repeatedly to conceal its war-making facilities and to obstruct the UN's inspectors. They have allowed themselves to be drawn into a humiliating cat-and-mouse game, scouring desert and suburb to find the hiding-places of missiles and materials that the Iraqis say do not exist. When Iraq is found to have been fibbing, the worst it gets is another hollow warning from the Security Council. And the obstruction is cleverly calibrated so that no individual episode is heinous enough to goad the UN into using force.
As a result, America's Central Intelligence Agency reckons that Mr Hussein may still be concealing hundreds of undeclared Scud missiles, and enough nuclear fuel and technology to build atomic weapons within a few years. But the CIA is not sure. The UN's special commission has similar fears. But it is not sure. The International Atomic Energy Agency calls such fears exaggerated. But--after failing dismally to detect Iraq's bomb programme before the war--it is not sure. The worrying points are that Mr. Hussein has managed things so that nobody can know who is right, and that he has got away with it. Now he is pushing his luck even further. Having been told by the UN to destroy four plants that make missiles, he is simply saying no (see page 41). This is what elicited the latest ultimatum from the Security Coucil, and why Mr Aziz has been summoned to New York next week.
Mr Hussein often backs down when the Security Council barks loudly enough. This time, whether from desperation or from growing confidence, he seems to have something else in mind. In recent weeks Iraq has begun to put forward the claim that it has discharged all its obligations under the ceasefire resolution, and that the time has therefore come to lift sanctions. Mr Aziz may arrive in New York under orders to say that future Iraqi co-operation with the Security Council will come only in return for some easing of sanctions.The hidden message will be that the world will never get its way in Iraq unless it collaborates with Mr. Hussein.
If so, the Security Council must steel itself to restore some of the authority it has let itself lose during the past year of Iraqi evasion. When Iraq denied trying to build nuclear weapons, and nobody knew where its nuclear operations were hidden, the UN had no obvious remedy. The latest argument is different. Knowing exactly where they are, the UN could destroy Iraq's missile factories unilaterally, from the air or by other means. The sound of bombs dropping again on Iraq will make many people shudder. It may be the only way to make Iraq comply with the terms of the ceasefire, bring an end to sanctions, and so restore hope to millions of despairing Iraqis."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224165742/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/4?accountid=14657,"Stability, enterprise, prosperity, progress: for more than a century, these have been the hallmarks of America's middle class. The dreams of the Great Middle--a house of one's own, a college education, doctors when necessary, a fine career in prospect--epitomise the American way. In a country that was founded on classlessness, more than 90% of Americans are now happy to call themselves middle class; and in every election since the second world war, winning politicians have pitched their appeals principally to them, the solid mass of workers and voters.
This year's presidential campaign, too, is pitched that way, but with a new urgency. Middle-class America today feels beleaguered, stranded and let down. A white-collar recession has turned long-term unease into short-term panic. People are losing their jobs; the value of their houses is falling; their health insurance does not cover them; the cost of college for their children is going up; George Bush (who promised not to) has raised their taxes. They say they need help, and fast.
The candidates are falling over themselves to oblige. Their solution is a middle-class tax cut. Mr Bush, who promised a little something in his budget, was promptly attacked by Pat Buchanan, his main Republican challenger, for not doing more. Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail--with the sober exception of Paul Tsongas, who preaches pain--are pushing for even bigger tax cuts.
Alas, cuts are a non-solution to the wrong problem. Two long-term trends worry Mr and Mrs Average: stagnating real wages, and a growing gap between rich and poor. Since the first oil shock in 1973, the real wages of most American workers have stagnated or fallen. (Family incomes have risen, though, largely because more women are going out to work.) And the number of Americans with incomes classified as ""middle class"" has declined. According to the Census Bureau, their share of the population fell from 71.2% in 1969 to 63.3% in 1989.
What does this apparent decline prove? Mainly that the middle-class escalator is still in working order. Between 1969 and 1989, although the percentage of Americans with low incomes rose from 17.9% to 22.1%, the ranks of the rich increased at a faster rate, from 10.9% to 14.7%. Americans, more than other people, have always accepted inequality as the price of opportunity. A survey in 1990 found that whereas more than 60% of Germans, Britons and Italians thought that ""it is the responsibility of the government to reduce the differences in income between people with high incomes and those with low incomes"", only 29% of Americans agreed.
Nor does the claim that recent tax policy has hit the middle class in favour of the rich go to the nub of the problem. True, taxes have increased income inequality a bit over the past decade, but easily the biggest shifts have come in income before tax. In other words, they were the result of changes in people's earning power rather than of government bias towards the wealthy. Educated and skilled Americans are still prospering. Inadequately skilled ones are finding the going ever tougher. The underlying cause of the wage-gloom of those in the middle is a slowdown in the growth of American productivity. From 1947 to 1970 American productivity went up by almost 3% a year. Since then it has gone up by an average of just 1% a year.
A tax break for the middle classes will not help here, anymore than you can bail out a boat by slopping water from the middle to the ends. For ""lower taxes for the middle class"", read ""lower taxes"" full stop. They will add to the federal deficit, which is already approaching $400 billion a year. The deficit merely eats into tomorrow's growth--and boosts tomorrow's tax bills, because interest on the extra borrowing will have to be paid for. Although the Democrats claim they want to balance middle-income tax cuts with a tax increase for the top 1% of earners, experience suggests that the cut will be quick, but the increase slow and inadequate.
THE TRICKLE-UP EFFECT
The better answers, both to the slowdown in productivity and to the diminished sense of well-being of ordinary Americans, lie in education and health care. The costs of an American hospital bed or a college place have risen far faster than the average American's ability to add value. So either productivity must rise by more, or the cost of college and hospital must rise by less. Both goals require changes in health care and education, so that children are taught the skills that make them productive, while doctors and professors deliver their services at prices ordinary people can afford.
Reforming America's ramshackle system of college loans could help more middle-class people go to college. But the problems of the, poor and their schooling are much more urgent. The median family income of people who dropped out of high school fell by 25% between 1973 and 1989--powerful proof of the cost of having few thoughts in an increasingly thought-based economy. The idea that middle-class America can protect itself from such failings by taxing itself is an illusion.
Health care, like education, is a question both of today's comforts and of tomorrow's growth. Its mounting cost worries workers and saps corporate investment. (General Motors, which has just announced record losses, now spends more on health care than on steel.) Any health-care reform that provided more people with care at less cost would not only improve American competitiveness; it would also revive the spirit of the scared middle classes."

Since the body concerned is the British Broadcasting Corporation, its defence will be elegant, and given every airing. And most of what it says will be wrong.
The debate over the BBC is prompted by its charter coming up for renewal in 1996. That will set the BBC's domestic course into the next century--its finances, staffing, channels, the lot--and for both radio and television. The likelihood is that the BBC will be expected to narrow the range of what it does, and will be put on a stricter budgetary diet. That is how venerable British institutions are usually reformed. Indeed, that is what the BBC is already doing. Over the past five years it has cut the number of employees by 20%, and bought more of its programmes from independent producers and fewer from its in-house staff. These changes ought not to deflect Parliament from asking a bigger question: why is a publicly financed broadcaster needed at all?
That question would seem absurd if it were asked about book publishers or newspapers. In Gutenberg's day, the output from printing presses was both rare and potentially subversive; church and state sought to own the presses, or at least to control what they published. As the technology spread, control became more difficult and was deemed less necessary. Today publishing is as easily and suitably dealt with by private markets as light bulbs are. That is the way broadcasting is going, and far quicker than a small minority of Britons realise. Unfortunately, that minority includes members of Parliament, senior civil servants and other decision-making types. They do not watch much television or listen to many radio programmes, but never mind: they do have strong views about broadcasting.
Their views are based on two myths. First, that their fellow Britons use television sets to watch four channels (two BBC, financed by the licence fee; and two ITV, financed by revenue from advertisements). Reality is different, and more so every day. At the start of 1989 there were only 20,000 satellite dishes; now there are 2.2m, receiving programmes from 11 commercial channels. Cable television goes to 1.1m households, and offers roughly 30 channels. Most important of all, two-thirds of Britain's 23m households now own video-cassette recorders, which give near-total freedom to watch what you like when you like. The local video shop has almost as many titles as the local book shop. Welcome to the age of electronic publishing.
That age has already arrived in America, which prompts myth number two: that American television is wall-to-wall junk, with the proliferation of channels merely expanding the junk. This myth is nurtured by the familiar experience of the British visitor to America--jet-lagged, awake at odd hours, flicking through channels on the hotel set. Actually, that is no fairer a reflection of the range and quality of American viewing than, say, ""The Forsyte Saga"" would be of the BBC's output. The full range of television in America--the networks, local stations, cable channels, satellite, videos--is far greater than anything Britain has yet experienced. As a result, it caters to different tastes and interests far more effectively.
It is only a matter of time before British television sets will be able to receive a similar range of programmes. For radio, that time has already come, which is why most of the BBC's radio output is hard to distinguish from the rest of the airwaves--except in the way it is financed. There is no logical reason for financing, eg, the BBC's music stations out of licence-fee revenue. Increasingly, the same will be true of BBC television.
It is not just access to the airwaves that is being transformed by technology; it is also methods of payment. In the early days of radio and television, it made sense to finance broadcasting centrally. Then advertisements came along to provide revenue, just as they had done with the press. Now it is possible to charge each listener or viewer the equivalent of a newspaper's cover price. Buying or renting a satellite receiver; paying for a cable connection; buying a decoder, to receive a scrambled transmission; paying only for programmes that are actually watched: all these are now technically feasible, and their use will spread. The licence fee, always an indefensibly regressive tax, has become an unnecessary anachronism as well.
AUNTY'S RUMP
More channels and more programmes, and more ways of paying for them: by the end of the century the traditional BBC would be looking as quaint as a Morris Oxford on a motorway. It used to be the only form of television; today its share of viewing hours is down to 44% ;by the mid-1990s, on most estimates, it will be only 35-40%. But even the most radical review of the corporation's charter should take account of two worries of the Morris-Oxford lovers: what will happen to the BBC's quality programmes, and to its training of staff? However, the answers need not involve protecting the BBC itself. It would be quite possible for the broadcasting commissions to lay down programming rules--so many hours of news a week, so many documentaries a year--for all commercial stations; they do something similar at the moment. And the government could finance the training of young technicians, producers and so on, much as the BBC does today.
Those changes would not mean the disappearance of the BBC; rather, its wholesale reform. The corporation would be left as a powerful brand name, giving it the ability to attract good programme makers and loyal audiences. It--or, more likely, lots of its: the BBC sports unit, the BBC current-affairs team, etc--would then sell its output to commercial channels. To smooth this transition, Parliament could provide public money for broadcasters to buy BBC programmes; or, as recommended by the Peacock report in 1986, it could set up a broadcasting council that would finance certain programmes, rather as the Arts Council does for the art world. A bit of public money would help ensure that, for example, some broadcasting was not interrupted by commercials. In time, enough people would probably be willing to pay large enough subscriptions in order to avoid commercial breaks. Indeed, the biggest oddity of the licence-fee system is that 60% of Britons say they would pay roughly double the current fee of L77 a year to get the BBC's output; others would pay not a penny, preferring to spend their money on the programmes and videos of their choice.
Ah, choice. That is the real subversion, and in every area of life it spreads as fast as technology and economics and legislation will allow. In broadcasting both technology and economics now make choice possible. In 1996 the law should catch up."

The great thing about rule by statute is that it is open to all, and is seen to be objective. Its vices are that complex legal rules encourage litigation, and that laws written by outsiders may fail to reflect the reality of sophisticated markets. There lies the virtue of self-regulation: it is handled by practitioners well-versed in market ways and flexible enough to change with the times. And there, too, its vice: insiders have conflicts of interest, and are too chummy with those they regulate.
With its new Financial Services Act, Britain chose to blend statute and self-regulation, aiming to combine their advantages. In every year since 1988, when that act came into effect, it has become clearer that the opposite has happened. Britain has married legal complexity to conflict of interest. It is time to seek virtue elsewhere--in statutory rule by a single, independent body. Britain needs the equivalent of America's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Regulatory messes abound: Lloyd's of London and the Maxwell companies' raided pension funds are the latest to blacken the City's name. Yet the Blue Arrow trial that ended last month offers the most striking example of run-of-the-mill regulatory failure. Although the events that gave rise to it took place while the current system of regulation was being bedded down, the way in which the case was handled demonstrates defects that still plague the City (see pages 23-26). Understandably, most attention has gone to the five defendants (investment bankers at County NatWest and UBS Phillips & Drew) and to the prosecutor (the SFO--the Serious Fraud Office). Can juries understand fraud cases? Is there a better way? The debate rumbles on, and misses the biggest lesson of the trial.
Fragmented self-regulation does not work. As our article shows, one culprit was not even in the dock: the Bank of England. As County NatWest is a subsidiary of the National Westminster Bank, the Bank of England was its ""lead regulator"". Virtually from the start, the Bank had all the information to conclude that County was misleading the market after Blue Arrow's 1987 rights issue. Yet it did nothing. Worse, it aided a cover-up of the affair, and attempted to head off an investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
The Bank of England is a statutory body. Yet it has evolved in a self-regulatory system. It sees itself as close to the City and, in a way, its champion. When the Blue Arrow affair arose, involving Britain's biggest bank, the Bank of England thought it should try to help NatWest wriggle away. It was more concerned with safeguarding NatWest's reputation and capital ratios than with exposing transgression. The moral hazard is clear. The subjects of regulation, or at least the big and favoured ones, are encouraged to trade at the limits of the law, knowing that their supervisor will seek to limit the damage if they break it. In this shameful affair, he worst shame of all lies in the heart of the City, with the Bank of England.
The ills of the Blue Arrow affair being with Britain's regulatory system, even though they end in the flawed choices of men. The British method is splintered, with duties divided among many bodies, some of which, like the Bank, have conflicts of interest; and the system fools itself and the public into thinking that it works by self-regulation, when in reality the final verdict lies in the statute book. Both drawbacks need correcting.
CONSOLIDATE, LIBERATE, EMPOWER
London already has an independent agency overseeing investment: the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). Its powers derive from those granted by statute to the DTI. But the SIB delegates much of its work to other bodies, notably five self-regulatory organisations, and to market authorities. It has no powers over insider trading and breaches of company law; those are the job of the DTI. Nor does it rule on takeors, which are governed by the City's voluntary Takeover Panel. All of its meagre budget comes from levies on those it regulates.
The single best change that London should make is to consolidate regulation in the hands of the SIB, modelling it on America's SEC. The SEC is strictly independent of those it regulates. Like the SIB, it uses some self-regulatory bodies (such as the New York Stock Exchange) to monitor markets and participants, and to provide information. But the bulk of the work, and the power, stays at the SEC. Its resources come from the taxpayer and from registration fees. Investors and intermediaries alike know who is in charge, who makes the rules and who enforces them. When necessary, the SEC can operate informally in the old London style; few would ignore a call from the SEC's head of enforcement, audibly waggling his eyebrows. Yet the commission's rules are clear, and vigorously applied. Most crucially, it can bring actions under civil law to secure swinging fines, with a less demanding burden of proof than that required in criminal proceedings.
A consolidated regulator in Britain would not be immune from lobbies and conflicts. But it would be less prone to them. The seat of power and the motives for its use would also be clearer, and its operations speedier. At the SEC, the responsibilities of surveillance, evaluation and enforcement are discharged in the same building, enabling information to move more freely and action to occur more rapidly than in London, despite the City's supposed informality and flexibility.
In cases like Blue Arrow and Guinness, the slow and erratic process of prosecuting financial crime in Britain has been widely blamed on the SFO, the body that in 1988 took on the role of chasing big and complex fraud. The regulatory system itself is more at fault. The Bank, the DTI, the SIB: all can start investigations and pass cases to the SFO. Yet they do so after long delays, and after battling with each other over whether there is a case to pass. A consolidated regulator, liberated from the City, would face fewer impediments. It would also be unlikely to share the Bank of England's fate: a regulator exposed in court for obstructing its own regulation."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224168146/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/7?accountid=14657,"For an airline passenger, happiness is a quiet airport, a half-empty aeroplane and a rock-bottom fare. The airline which sold him the seat dreams (though it would never admit it) of precisely the opposite: airports teeming with high-paying customers who can be packed on to aircraft like sardines. No government edict is ever likely to resolve these conflicting interests. But markets could, if they were allowed to. The chances of that happening soon are slim. No matter how crowded or empty the aeroplane, one silent, unwilling passenger always goes along for the ride: the taxpayer.
The world's air-transport industry has been shaped by the clumsy hands of governments ever since its birth 80 years ago. Today, despite the freeing of airline fares and routes in America and much talk of deregulation in Europe, air transport remains more subject to the largesse and strictures of bureaucrats than almost any other industry. Every aircraft maker is subsidised. Many airlines are either state-owned or subsidised. Routes and fares nearly everywhere outside. America are fixed by official fiat. At one end of the industry, governments dole out cash to aircraft makers; at the other, they hold down demand for aircraft by restricting the competition among airlines that would let growth in traffic soar.
Government meddling in every aspect of air travel has so distorted the industry that it makes sense for the companies which operate in it to spend much of their time begging for yet more government help. As a result air transport often seems to operate in an economic daze. Boeing complains about the subsidies given to Europe's Airbus. Airbus replies that, without government cash, it could never challenge Boeing's dominance because the American firm has also been subsidised by past military contracts for the Pentagon. McDonnell Douglas uses similar arguments to justify seeking cash from the Taiwanese government. Boeing again cries foul and hints that it may seek more subsidies itself. Despite today's glut of aeroplanes, all three firms predict their sales will boom over the next two decades, apparently unaware that this should make subsidies unnecessary.
Meanwhile Robert Crandall, head of American Airlines, complains that, despite the billions poured into plane-making subsidies, commercial aircraft are too expensive. Lean profits among airlines mean that the sales forecasts of the aircraft makers may turn out to be so much wishful thinking (see page 67). Yet airline chiefs everywhere oppose opening their home markets to rivals--while pushing to get into everyone else's. Governments oblige them on the first point, and continue to enforce an international fare-fixing cartel.
Does it have to be this way? Many advocates of ""industrial policy"" say yes. (Some, believe it or not, cite the airline business as an example of how other industries should be run.) Since governments are already operating a de facto industrial policy, it is argued, the best that governments can do is to try to make it coherent. Before seeking this greater coherence, it is worth pausing to imagine an air-transport industry free from all subsidy and intervention.
A FLIGHT OF FANCY
With a free industry, it is safe to assume that millions more passengers would travel on thousands more aircraft at cheaper fares. In the ten years after America deregulated its domestic airline industry in 1978, fares dropped, traffic doubled and the purchase of new aircraft surged. Another safe assumption is that fewer countries would have a ""flag-carrier""--something for chauvinists to regret and taxpayers to celebrate.
It is also probable that a much greater variety of commercial aircraft would be available, and that their shape, size, price and range would be different from today's. Patterns of travel would also be different. The reason is that the design of aircraft is determined largely by the routes to be flown and the number of people to be carried. In turn, routes and traffic volumes are largely determined by the flights, fares and aircraft available. Fiddle with one factor and it affects all the others.
Pie in the sky? In the short term, maybe. Simply because governments are so involved in the industry, it would take time to disentangle them. But a free market in air transport remains a worthy, and increasingly realistic, goal. The original arguments for government meddling no longer make sense. No nation needs its own flag-carrying airline for its security; in time of war any airline's aircraft can be requisitioned. Similarly, not every country needs a civilian aircraft-maker. Building military aircraft is now vastly different from producing commercial jets. Supercomputers are making it cheaper and faster to design new aeroplanes. If the subsidy war among aircraft builders ended, new competitors might break into the business.
Governments bold enough to deregulate their airlines and stop subsidising aircraft makers will save billions. Far from suffering, their consumers will benefit too. History aside, there is no longer any reason for the taxpayer to board every flight."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224135862/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/8?accountid=14657,"On the evening of September 28th 1987, National Westminster's bid to become a real force in investment banking began to falter. A gathering in the City, at the Drapers' Gardens office of its merchant bank, County NatWest, was considering the results of a rights issue. Advised by County, Blue Arrow, a British employment agency, was raising L837m ($1.4 billion) to buy Manpower, an American one. The issue had flopped.
Those present included Tony Berry, Blue Arrow's chairman; Nicholas Wells, the 33-year-old corporate financier who had masterminded the deal for County; David Reed, the merchant bank's swashbuckling head of corporate finance; and Martin Gibbs, head of corporate finance at Phillips & Drew (P&D), stockbrokers to Blue Arrow. Investment bankers from Dillon Read, Blue Arrow's American advisers, also were present.
County had hoped that this rights issue, at the time London's largest ever, would propel it into the big league of merchant banking. But the news that evening was grim. Blue Arrow shareholders had taken up their rights to only 38% of the shares on offer. County did not want to make the sub-underwriters take the remainder, for the issue would then be seen as the failure it was, and the share price would fall. County had underwritten a quarter of the deal itself.
Mr Berry took the Blue Arrow contingent out for some Chinese food, leaving the advisers to try to salvage the deal. They hatched a scheme to sell the remaining shares by placing them with investing institutions, and--to make sure they found buyers--to mislead the market into thinking that the rights issue had been more popular than it had. So, after the deadline for the closure of the rights issue, County, P&D and Dillon Read bought enough shares to bring the proportion taken up to 49%.
Nat day Messrs Reed and Wells told Jonathan Cohen, County's forceful chief executive, of the plan. A press release from County and an advertisement from P&D said that 49% of the rights had been taken up, and the remainder successfully placed at a premium. The advisers bought more shares in the placing; County NatWest and County NatWest Securities, its market maker, each ended up with just under 5% of Blue Arrow. Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), P&D's parent, held about 4%, and was protected by an indemnity under which County promised to make good any losses it might suffer on the shares. County gave an oral indemnity to its own market maker.
All this left County NatWest with an interest (including the shares held by UBS) in 13.5% of Blue Arrow, worth L150m. The Companies Act required that any holding of 5% (today 3%) or more in a company be disclosed. County kept quiet, on the grounds that it did not own UBS's stake, and that the law exempted market makers from disclosure. That exemption, however, covers only shares held by market makers in the normal course of business. County NatWest Securities had been force-fed its Blue Arrow shares, and had to keep them on a ""back back book"" that its traders did not know about.
On September 29th Messrs Reed and Wells briefed John Plastow, an executive director of NatWest, Charles Green and Terry Green (no kin), both deputy chief executives of that bank. (Charles Green, like Mr Wells, is an active member of the Church of England, and was known in the City for his speeches on the need for morality in financial life.) The two County men explained the three-way division of County's interest in Blue Arrow, as well as the UBS indemnity. They said that lawyers had approved the deal. Later that day the two Messrs Green briefed NatWest's three deputy chairmen, Lord Harrowby, Sir Edwin Nixon and Philip Wilkinson. Tom Frost, NatWest's chief executive, was in America, at the IMF conference, as was Charles Villiers, County's chairman. Mr Frost was new to his job, having replaced Mr Wilkinson in July.
TALKING TO THE BANK OF ENGLAND
On September 30th Messrs Reed, Wells and Stephen Clark, County's finance director, called on David Carse, a supervisor at the Bank of England. They told him they had parcelled out the shares between UBS, County NatWest and its market maker in order to avoid disclosure, and explained the UBS indemnity. Mr Carse asked if they were sure they had no disclosable interest under the Companies Act. Mr Wells gave an assurance (the Bank noted in a record of the meeting) that they had taken ""double, even treble legal advice"". County, in its record, noted that ""Carse congratulated us upon the overall success of the deal to date"".
But had County taken legal advice? County's solicitors, Travers, Smith & Braithwaite, provided a letter saying that the UBS indemnity was lawful: lawyers still debate that opinion. But no lawyer had said that the market maker's stake need not be added to County's for the purposes of disclosure. No lawyer had been present at the meeting on September 28th. A partner from Travers, Smith & Braithwaite had been at an earlier meeting on September 23rd. He had made the general point that a market maker which bought shares for its own business need not disclose then, but no details or numbers were discussed.
The Bank of England never asked to see the legal advice. Nor did it ask how the nondisclosure of a market maker's position worth L50m--more than its entire book was normally worth--could comply with the Companies Act. The Bank argues that the Stock Exchange was responsible for supervising stockmarkets. But the Bank was and is ""lead regulator"" for County NatWest, which means that it should take an overall view of County's business. County told the Stock Exchange that its market maker had a large position, but would not name the company whose shares it held. At a later routine meeting of financial regulators the Stock Exchange asked about this position; the Bank of England said that banking secrecy prevented it from revealing the name.
BLACK MONDAY
But for the stockmarket crash of October 19th 1987, the secret might never have got out. The crash halved Blue Arrow's share price, and dashed County's hopes of selling the shares gradually in a buoyant market. County's Mr Clark made frequent visits to the Bank of England to discuss Blue Arrow.
The Bank's director responsible for banking supervision was Rodney Galpin. He had NatWest's top brass--including Mr Frost--round for dinner on October 26th. Before that meeting, Mr Carse wrote a briefing note for Mr Galpin. This mentioned County's losses on Blue Arrow and said: ""Note this is extremely market-sensitive--as far as the market knows, all the shares were successfully placed."" At the Blue Arrow trial, Mr Galpin told the court that when he read those words he did not suspect there was anything wrong. He was more worried about how the Blue Arrow stake would affect NatWest's capital ratios.
In November NatWest got a shock: it learnt that Handelsbank NatWest, a Swiss subsidiary, owned 1.2m Blue Arrow shares, 0.14% of the equity. This brought NatWest's stake (excluding the shares that were parked with its market maker and with UBS) to just over 5%. County quickly moved 1m of the shares that it owned to its market maker, to push the figure below 5%. It told the Bank of England of its discovery and the resulting shift of shares, saying that lawyers advised there was still no need to disclose.
By the time Mr Clark paid the Bank yet another visit, on November 24th, it was starting to fret. Mr Carse asked, for the first time, whether County had observed the spirit of the Companies Act. When Mr Clark dropped in on December 6th, Mr Carse said the Bank could not give absolution from disclosure requirements, and ""wondered"" if the market had been misled.
Four years later Postel Investment Managers, an insurer called Clerical Medical and GEC Pension Fund said in court that they would not have bought Blue Arrow shares in the subsequent placing if they had known that advisers had taken a quarter of the rights issue.
UNRAVELLING
In early December, facing a year-end audit, NatWest decided to transfer the marketmaker's stake to County itself, and to admit to owning 9.5% of Blue Arrow. Some board members wanted to reveal the UBS holding and indemnity at the same time. Messrs Reed and Wells argued that County could cope with revealing 9.5% of Blue Arrow, but that its credibility would be undermined if it admitted to 13.5%. If the indemnity could be wound up before any disclosure, why mention it? The two men reinforced their case by threatening to resign.
Mr Frost backed them. On December 8th he visited Mr Galpin to tell him of the coming announcement. Mr Galpin did not propose that NatWest should reveal all, but did suggest informing the Stock Exchange and the Takeover Panel. Mr Frost said that he would do that but did not.
On December 17th Terry Green struck a deal with Robert Studer, president of UBS, whereby the Swiss bank cancelled the indemnity and kept the shares, in return for L32m. (NatWest's losses on Blue Arrow were to total L96m, though they were partly oftset by a hedging profit of L18m and advisory Iees of L12.Sm.) County then announced it owned 9.5% of Blue Arrow.
THE WHITEWASH BEGINS
In January 1988, a report in The Economist asked whether County NatWest had broken the disclosure requirements of the Companies Act by fulfilling to disclose its market maker's holding. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)began to make inquiries. At the end of February, County's chairman and its chief executive, Mr Villiers and Mr Cohen, resigned. The Bank of England then persuaded the DTI to cease its inquiries and to let NatWest investigate its subsidiary's conduct. The Bank saw nothing improper in this arrangement, although NatWest's top management had known the details of the Blue Arrow deal throughout.
Terry Green took over from Mr Cohen as chief executive of County. He telephoned Mr Galpin on February 29th to tell him that Mr Wilkinson, one of the three NatWest deputy chairmen, would write the report on Blue Arrow. Mr Green noted afterwards: ""(Mr Galpin)said the Bank was not unduly worried on any score and that they were not looking for any investigations.""
Mr Wilkinson charged Hugh Hudson, a NatWest inspector from its internal audit team, with the investigation. Terry Green told Mr Hudson not to interview any County staff who had since left the bank. This meant that he could not talk to most of those directly involved in the deal.
Mr Hudson said, in the course of the Blue Arrow trial, that he felt letdown not to have received any documents referring to Mr Frost's or Mr Wilkinson's involvement in the affair. He expressed surprise at having been chosen for the task, since, out of 20-30 available inspectors, he was one of the least experienced and knew nothing about securities markets. He confirmed that the purpose of the report had been to head off outside criticism and to identify areas which could cause concern if made public.
Mr Hudson's first report was ready at the end of March. It was an incomplete account, but it did suggest that fresh legal advice be taken. Lord Boardman, NatWest's then chairman, reacted vigorously. In a note to Mr Frost of April 18th, he said that it seemed evident that, because of the indemnities, NatWest had had a disclosable interest in the holdings both of UBS and of its own market maker. He said that Travers, Smith & Braithwaite was too closely involved and that new advice should be taken.
Lord Boardman then found a solicitor from Slaughter & May for Mr Frost to talk to. Mr Frost spoke to this solicitor three times on the telephone between April 20th and May 9th, but told him on each occasion that his help was not yet needed. NatWest's auditors, Ernst & Whinney, had already told Mr Wilkinson in January that counsel's opinion should be sought on the marketmaker exemption; that was not done.
HELP FROM THE BANK
On April 20th Mr Frost and Mr Wilkinson visited Brian Quinn, head of banking supervision at the Bank of England under Mr Galpin, and Roger Barnes, his deputy. The Bank of England, Mr Wilkinson recorded, said that the DTI was ""considering whether to mount their own inquiry, but at the moment the Bank had been able to stave this off only temporarily"". The Bank noted that Messrs Wilkinson and Frost thought they ""must"" seek alternative legal advice. In the event, they did not do so. Mr Barnes later told the Blue Arrow court that he felt they had misled him.
Helped by a personal assistant of Mr Frost, Mr Wilkinson rewrote Mr Hudson's report, producing a document that was much less critical of County. The Wilkinson report made a strange error about the Handelsbank stake: it claimed that this subsidiary's 0.14% was double-counted, and that NatWest had thus never breached the 5% disclosure rule. In fact the Handelsbank stake had not been double counted. Mr. Wilkinson's sums were wrong.
Mr Wilkinson's report concluded that the market maker had bought its stake voluntarily, and that lawyers had cleared the purchase. The report did not mention the fact that NatWest's management (including Mr Wilkinson) had known all about the deal from September 29th. Mr Frost's name did not figure in the report at all.
The Messrs Green approved the report, Mr Frost read it and the Bank of England studied it. None of them noticed the error about Handelsbank NatWest. The Bank decided to help NatWest rewrite the report belore sending it to the DTI. A note by Charles Green records a meeting with Mr Quinn on May 17th: ""The line to be taken was, first, that there had been technical shortcomings (because of an overnight trade of Blue Arrow shares in November, which had briefly pushed County's stake over 5%)...second, (Mr Wilkinson) should report a measure of ambiguity on whether there was conscious or subconscious circumvention of rules on the market-maker holdings.""
On May 23rd Mr Frost wrote to Mr Wilkinson, saying that he had sent the report to the DTI and that ""the Bank of England's suggested line has been adopted."" Mr Wilkinson then sent a note to Mr Quinn: ""Thank you and Roger far all your helpful advice."" On June 20th the DTI asked NatWest far fresh infarsnation, which it received only on August 5th. In October The Economists reported that there had been an internal inquiry and that it was a whitewash. The Bank of England tried hard to persuade the DTI not to open a formal inquiry. But in December the DTI appointed inspectors to look into the affair.
The inspectors' report, published in July 1989, got close to the truth. Its criticism of Mr Plastow and of Charles and Terry Green--the three NatWest executives briefed on September 29th 1987--led to their resignations. Lord Boardman retired early. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) charged 11 of those involved, plus County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and P&D, with fraud. Seven men and the three institutions were put on trial last year. Two men and the institutions were discharged from the case. The jury last month acquitted one man, and found four--Messrs Cohen, Reed, Wells and Gibbs--guilty of misleading the market.
TELEFON TOM
Mr Frost appeared in court as a witness for the defence. In his evidence he admitted no responsibility for what went wrong. He was the only executive director of NatWest to keep his job after the DTI inquiry, which hardly mentioned him. Mr Frost had told the DTI inspectors that, after taking part in a meeting on July 30th 1987 which approved the rights issue, he had no specific recollection of Blue Arrow until Black Monday.
It became clear during the trial that Mr Frost had known about most of the decisions concerning Blue Arrow. He had met Mr Galpin on September 2nd 1987 and discussed the risk that Blue Arrow's share price might fall. Mr Villiers had told him about the deal while they were at the IMF meeting together in Washington. Charles Green had rung Mr Frost about Blue Arrow while he was out of the country, and had prepared a report which was waiting far him on his return to Britain a few days later.
The DTI inspectors did not know the full extent of Mr Frost's involvement, because NatWest had failed to supply them with many crucial documents. During the trial, the SFO and lawyers acting for defendants held up proceedings while they extracted with some difficulty--further documents from Mr Frost's office in NatWest.
The DTI inspectors had never seen some of these documents; they had seen only ""clean"" versions of others. Originals, carrying Mr Frost's handwriting or initials, were produced in court. Fresh documents showed that he had been aware of each stage of the rights issue's progress in July and August 1987. A minute of Mr Clark's meeting with the Bank of England on November 24th-when he was told that the Stock Exchange should be consulted-was proved to have passed through Mr Frost's office.
Nor did the inspectors know the full story about a signed memo by Mr Cohen on the history ofthe Blue Arrow deal, prepared far the NatWest board meeting of December 8th 1987. The DTI inquiry had received a clean version of it. Mr Frost told the court that he had not had any hand in writing this memo. But the court saw another version, carrying Mr Frost's handwriting, which showed that he had helped to amend the memo, in a way that made the Blue Arrow problem seem less urgent. Simon Morris, who had been secretary to the DTI inquiry, told the court that he was surprised not to have been supplied with this document.
REGULATOR AND SPONSOR
The affair also raises questions about the Bank of England's regulatory competence. The Bank does not think that Blue Arrow revealed any flaws in the way it supervises banks. It has not reformed its supervisory department, nor thought it necessary to set up its own legal department. None of its staff has been chastised. Since the Blue Arrow deal, Mr Galpin has become chairman ofa commercial bank, Standard Chartered; Mr Quinn has replaced him as director of supervision; and Mr Carse has become banking commissioner in Hongkong.
Many reckon one lesson of the Blue Arrow affair is that the Bank of England confuses its regulatory role with its role as sponsor of the City's interests. ""The Bank is guilty of knowing what was going on, but doing nothing to stop it,"" says one DTI official. ""If we had an affair like that, ministers would resign. But the Bank of England never lets anything ruffle its leathers."" The DTI itself should have moved faster. But at least--unlike the Bank of England and NatWest--it did not believe that either the City's interests or its own would be served by hushing up the seamy story that began on September 28th 1987."

The winner has yet to emerge, but the race for the nomination is beginning to throw up clear patterns of voting across the nation, from Utah to Georgia. These tell their own story.
The Democratic party may be divided into four components--blacks, white blue-collar voters in the north-east and mid-west, white blue-collar voters in the south (the ""Bubbas"", of whom the 1992 race has already heard too much), and white suburban liberals. On the evidence so far, it is plain that Bill Clinton is sweeping the votes of those blacks who turn out (he is also, if Colorado is a guide, sweeping the Hispanic vote). In Georgia, where he gained 58% of the total vote--the biggest share won by a single candidate in any race so far--he also, according to exit polls, won more than 70% of the black vote, compared with around 25% for Paul Tsongas. In Maryland, where Mr Tsongas won statewide by six points, Mr Clinton seems to have won about 50% of the black vote to around 30% for Mr Tsongas.
Since the next primaries are mainly in the south (South Carolina on March 7th and five other southern states on March 10th, Super Tuesday), where blacks make up a large proportion of the Democratic vote, Mr Clinton can look forward to more good times. Similarly, if Georgia is typical of the south, Mr Clinton is going to do well among the Bubbas and win Texas on Super Tuesday in a canter.
Mr Tsongas's strength is no less easy to divine; it is among suburban white liberals. He won their vote in New Hampshire and again in Maryland. In Montgomery county, Maryland (the affluent northern suburbs of Washington, DC), Mr Tsongas beat Mr Clinton by 50% to 24%. Across the state, exit polls show that he beat Mr Clinton by large margins among voters with annual incomes over $50,000.
In Gwinnett county, Atlanta's white northern suburbs, Mr Tsongas got 34% of the vote, within shouting distance of Mr Clinton's 45%. His performance in Atlanta's suburbs gives his campaign hope that it can upset Mr Clinton in Florida, whose Democratic voters tend to be whiter, richer and more liberal than anywhere else in the south. A new poll in the Miami Herald has Mr Tsongas closing to within five points of Mr Clinton in the state, although Mr Clinton has long been better organised.
The bad news for Mr Tsongas is that the white suburban vote may no longer be his alone. In Colorado, Jerry Brown, the victor, ran virtually even with Mr Tsongas among voters with a graduate degree. He beat Mr Tsongas easily among younger, affluent voters in the state. It is probable, for example, that he got the votes of the younger academics at the University of Colorado in Boulder, where Mr Brown's spaciness would be considered quite tame. Their older colleagues probably voted for Mr Tsongas.
Mr Brown campaigned hard in Colorado. With its crowd of Californian exiles and its vaguely alternative culture, at least among Democratic voters, this was natural territory for him. On March 3rd there was not much evidence outside Colorado that he was doing well in the suburbs (he was hammered in Gwinnett and Montgomery counties). But his anti-establishment politics, coupled with his green tinge (he has wounded Mr Tsongas by painting him as a booster of nuclear power), will find supporters elsewhere, especially in the overwhelmingly white and liberal ""northern tier"" states of the mid-west and west. He did surprisingly well in the Washington state caucuses, and can look forward to good results in Wisconsin on April 7th and Oregon on May 19th--all of which is likely to keep him alive for the California primary on June 2nd, when he and Mr Tsongas could split the suburban vote.
That leaves the white blue-collar workers of the north-east and mid-west. These voters are still unionised but, at least in the 1980s, increasingly ""conservative"" on economic issues. Many defected to Ronald Reagan; under George Bush they have started to drift back. This is the part of the old Democratic coalition that has barely been heard from so far. In both New Hampshire and Maryland they seem to have preferred Mr Clinton to Mr Tsongas, but neither state is an adequate test. That is why the primaries on March l7th in Michigan and Illinois are now so crucial; it is there that white ethnic voters will hold the key. In neither state is Mr Tsongas or Mr Clinton a natural favourite.
Two months ago, before New Hampshire, Mr Harkin might have been expected to do well in Michigan, where he has the backing of big industrial trade unions. He has kept his challenge alive, just, by tapping union support in Minnesota, where he won the caucuses on March 3rd. But his campaign is running out of money, and he will have a lousy Super Tuesday; it is hard to see him making much of a showing from now on.
The same is true of Bob Kerrey. The party's golden boy of old is now the ""vulture"" candidate, waiting for something to ruin either Mr Clinton or Mr Tsongas. Mr Kerrey spent a day in Georgia telling everyone that Mr Clinton was unelectable; then trumpeted a ""western"" strategy, which imploded when he ran a poor fourth in Colorado; then predicted that he could win the Arizona caucuses on March 7th; and has now returned to Washington, DC, with all his appointments canceled, a clear sign that his campaign may soon end.
Exit polls show, nonetheless, that Mr Kerrey's message about Mr Clinton's weakness has some force. The long month that Mr Clinton spent fighting allegations about infidelity and draft-dodging has taken its toll. People may not be voting against him, but in poll after poll it is clear that perhaps 40% of those who support him do so with no great enthusiasm. As Mr Clinton starts to plan his move from the south to the Great Lakes, it will be worth seeing whether he tries to win support by appealing to old-fashioned New Deal and protectionist sentiment there. The more cynical Clinton-watchers have been expecting this move for weeks; to be fair to him, he has not yet made it. But Mr Clinton never met a voter whom he did not like, nor one whose deepest concerns were not, quite by chance, his own."

""The lights, my friends,"" Patrick Buchanan told the admirers of his performance in Georgia's Republican primary, ""are burning late in the chanceries of the eastern liberal establishment tonight."" No doubt they were. Mr Buchanan and his rebel right-wing campaign are jubilant over the 36% of the Republican vote he won on March 3rd, just one percentage point short of his extraordinary showing in New Hampshire two weeks earlier.
As he headed off, bull-like, for the southern Super Tuesday'states, the talk was even of winning one of them--maybe Louisiana, or Mississippi. This, Mr Buchanan's boosters maintain, would keep his campaign going into the summer. Then, the race's most tempting fruit--the California primary--would be there for the plucking.
California's conservatives have long treated Mr Bush with disdain. Now the state's favourite conservative, Ronald Reagan, seems to do so as well. (""Sources close to"" Mr Reagan tell newspapers that Mr Bush does not stand for anything; he has endorsed Mr Bush only grudgingly.) In the 1988 presidential election Mr Bush beat Michael Dukakis in California by a mere 300,000 votes. Mr Buchanan's men dream that a strong showing by their hero in the primary might send Mr Bush crashing.
Nonetheless, Mr Buchanan's high-water mark has probably come with his showing in the primaries on March 3rd. He has won few convention delegates. Despite his description of Mr Bush's policies as ""near beer"" (the stuff they used to serve in the bars of St Louis when Mr Buchanan was a cub reporter), success for the president in the south's two most populous states, Texas and Florida, is certain and his nomination in August still seems all but assured.
Even Mr Buchanan's successes can tarnish when examined. In South Dakota, where Mr Buchanan was not running, 31% of Republicans marked their ballots as ""uncommitted"". In Georgia Mr Buchanan spent $390,000 (nearly twice as much as Mr Bush) broadcasting his message. In one television advertisement he rallied against the latest civil-rights bill. In another he lambasted homosexuality and state-subsidised ""pornographic"" work. (""I don't care what they do in their garrets,""he told the state legislature, ""with their precious bodily fluids and their bull-whips."")
Despite these efforts, he won only a few more percentage points in Georgia than Mr Uncommitted in South Dakota. Again, in the Colorado and Maryland primaries on March 3rd, where he did not campaign, Mr Buchanan won 30% of the Republican vote. His success seems to rest on protest rather than his own message.
The question the Bush camp must ask itself is how much of the Buchanan protest vote will transfer to a Democrat in November They can draw some comfort, even from Georgia. With his 64% in the Georgia primary, Mr Bush won more votes than he did in the 1988 general election. Georgia has never had a Republican governor, and only one (one-term) senator. On March 3rd, however, nearly half of the state's primary voters chose the Republican ballot, compared with 34% in 1980. This should alarm Democrats thinking about November.
Yet in Maryland there were also danger signs for Mr Bush. According to one Democratic consultant, an exit-poll there showed 85% of Buchanan voters favouring any Democrat over Mr Bush in a general election in November. Once Mr Bush's team gets to work on ""defining"" his Democratic opponent, those numbers will surely go down. But they will remind the president of the fate of two recent predecessors--Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter--who both fought off strong challenges for their party's nomination, only to lose the November election."

Even competitiveness councils have to compete. That is why America has three of them, all beavering away on schemes to keep the country up with the international Joneses--or, rather, the Toyotas. One, bringing together government officials, is headed by Dan Quayle; another, the first of the species, was started by Ronald Reagan in 1986, and comes from the private sector. It is the third, however, that promises to be the most influential: the Competitiveness Policy Council, set up jointly by the President and Congress, and consisting of a 12-strong group from business, government, universities and labour organisations. On March 4th it released its first annual report. This could well mark the return to respectability of two words that became dirty in the 1980s: industrial policy.
The council is chaired by Fred Bergsten, an economist who worked at the Treasury under Jimmy Carter and now runs his own think-tank, the Institute for International Economics. He provides the intellectual credibility, while practical men are represented by people like Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT, a big conglomerate, and Lynn Williams, head of the steelworkers' union. In part, the council's report--explained this week to every politician Mr Bergsten could find in Washington--is reacting to what it thinks is a changed public mood about economic policy; a rejection of quick fixes in preference for longer-term yet still interventionist measures. Inevitably, it is also an attempt to shape that mood.
Mr Bergsten's report is refreshingly clear about what the test of competitiveness is and where efforts to improve it must begin. Unconventionally, it rejects the trade deficit as a test: after all, that could easily be balanced by methods that would make Americans poorer. The council's chosen test is a rising and sustainable standard of living for Americans, provided by strong growth in productivity. Deliberately, it makes trade the last of its seven areas for action on the ground that America's problems originate at home, not abroad and that protectionism will worsen those problems, not solve them.
Macroeconomic policy is where the basic solutions begin. The council favours not just cutting the federal budget deficit but moving to a surplus to help rebuild national savings and release the resources for investment. After that imaginative leap, it advocates changes in tax policies to remove ""perverse incentives"" that discourage private savings and that, in the 1980s, pushed money into unproductive areas like property. It wants more government spending on infrastructure and tighter standards in education.
The most controversial proposal, however, is for an industrial policy. The report is somewhat vague about what this might consist of, but it uses phrases familiar from the Democratic primary campaigns of Bill Clinton and Paul Tsongas. Currently, government policies towards industry are ad hoc; they must become more coherent and so less prone to arbitrary decisions made on political grounds.
To achieve this goal, the council wants the government to hand industrial policy to a specific agency, rather than dispersing it as at present; it suggests a reinforced Commerce Department, or the International Trade Commission. Quite what this body would do is left vague: lots of research; projections of the future course of important industries; the production of ""visions"" of what a better course might be. The only proposal for concrete action is to put government money into some ""pre-competitive"" technologies, to help industry develop products it might otherwise neglect.
As is usually pointed out in such reports, America has long had successful industrial policies for defence and space. So why not for other industries? The trouble is that in those cases there were and are clear objectives and a single, identifiable client for the policy: the government itself. In other industries the special pleading is special; however coherent the administrative view, fragmented politics is prone to take over. It is on this problem that Mr Bergsten's council, along with other industrial-policy advocates, will have to be convincing."

It has become a cynical ritual, full of sound bites, signifying nothing. Both Congress and the Bush administration promise tax breaks for the beloved ""middle class"". Each knows its preferred measure will not get past the other. Both think they will thereby have scored a political point.
The ritual began with George Bush's ""state of the union"" speech in late January. Mr Bush announced various measures to stimulate America's economy, not least by putting some money back into the pockets of the middle class. Central to the plan was a $500-a-year tax credit for every child a family has--in effect, a child benefit. He challenged Congress to enact his plans by March 20th. Advantage Bush.
The president's mistake was to exclude the credit from the tax bill that loyal Republicans introduced in Congress. Mr Bush's men saw, rightly, that getting the credit past Congress without raising taxes on the rich to pay for it would scupper his other, less contentious, proposals. But this allowed Patrick Buchanan to seize upon Mr Bush's supposed turnabout and make it a central, and successful, theme of his campaign.
The Democrats too, were anxious to reclaim the issue of ""tax fairness"" for themselves. Dan Rostenkowski, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and a man no tax bill may bypass, faces an uncomfortable primary election on March 17th in his Chicago district. His constituents had told him they would like more money, and Mr Rostenkowski is alert to their desires. So he fashioned a national tax bill, which promised a middleclass tax break of $200 for individuals and $400 for families.
On March 3rd a tax plan also emerged from the Senate Finance Committee, which is headed by a conservative Democrat, Lloyd Bentsen. This bore a striking likeness to Mr Bush's proposals. For instance, the committee backs tax breaks for investment and proposes a cut in the capital-gains tax (by indexing capital gains to inflation). The Senate's plan, like the one from the White House, gives a tax break to families with children, rather than to all middle-income taxpayers. Indeed its tax credit--at $300 a family--is smaller than Mr Bush's. And it does not benefit those poor Americans who do not pay enough tax from which to be exempted.
Both the House and Senate proposals, however, contain an element that is pure poison to an election-year White House. They soak the rich to pay for tax credits--principally by raising the top rate of income tax from 31% to 35-36%. The president could not possibly agree to that. In his new confessional mood, Mr Bush has admitted that raising taxes in the 1990 budget deal was a ghastly political mistake. The minimum tax increase that Congress and the Democrats now say they will hold out for is a 10% extra tax surcharge on millionaires, which would impoverish the latter collectively by a mere $7 billion over five years. Mr Bush would not dare agree even to that. So he will veto any bill Congress passes, which is just what Congress wants in order to paint Mr Bush as the enemy of the plain American.
There is only one way now for a ""middle-class"" tax break to get enacted this year: collusion between Congress and the administration to scrap the few disciplines of the 1990 budget agreement. Then savings from defence cuts could go to pay for tax breaks. Currently, such savings would have to go towards cutting the budget deficit. The danger of scrapping the 1990 deal, as many conservatives see it, is that an orgy of spending--and then taxing--would follow. Next week the two most powerful people in the budget process--Richard Darman, the administration's budget director, and Robert Byrd, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee--are due to get together. These men were the architects of the 1990 deal. Will they scrap it now, and risk making conservatives even angrier?"

On March 10th, ""Super Tuesday"", 11 states will choose their delegates to the national conventions. Texas, Florida and Massachusetts matter most. We offer some hints for the candidates.
TEXAS
REPUBLICAN DELEGATES: 121, the second biggest group to be won. Best tip for a Republican candidate: make Texas your home. George Bush has done so, simply by spending a dozen nights a year in Suite 271 at the Houstonian Hotel in Houston. Two days after the New Hampshire primary, the Houstonian filed for bankruptcy; but the president is still comfortable, and among friends. Recent polls show more than 80% support for him. Unless he can appeal to unemployed defence workers, disgruntled by the peace dividend, Patrick Buchanan will not make much of a showing.
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES: 196. Best tip for a Democratic candidate: first, go to the Alamo, the sacred ground where early Texans defied the Mexicans in 1836; and second, pay a call on Jess Hay, king of the Democratic fund-raisers, whose Rolodex, it is said, should be cast in gold. Unhelpful fact: Bill Clinton has got there first. Mr Clinton has already captured the key endorsement of Henry Cisneros, the former mayor of San Antonio, where sits the Alamo; and Mr Hay is solid in Mr Clinton's corner because he likes a pro-business man as governor of next-door Arkansas.
Third, get the endorsement of the Mexican-American Democrats. Mr Clinton did so early, attending the MAD convention in mid-January when eyeryone else was in New Hampshire. Hispanic voters comprise about a quarter of the state's electorate. Only labour remains up for grabs.
Lastly, if you favour a petrol tax, don't mention it. Paul Tsongas would do well to blank out that passage in his ""Call to Economic Arms"".
FLORIDA
The following tips apply to all candidates. Be nice to old folk; do whatever you can to get on television; and, in general, win New Hampshire. The winner in that primary usually rolls on throuh Florida on a wave of exposure on the network news, although ""Junior Tuesday"" has altered the scene a bit.
REPUBLICAN DELEGATES: 97. Best tip for a Republican candidate: put your son in Miami, where he can build up a political network. Jeb Bush has done a good job. Here, once again, Mr Bush is safe among friends. In north Florida, a region bristling with military installations and voters, the president still gets credit for Desert Storm.
Mr Buchanan's constituency, Republicans earning below $15,000 a year, is barely a sliver in Florida outside the Panhandle. His only soulmates are the Cuban exiles in Miami, who are furious with Mr Bush over reports that the administration routinely warned the Castro regime when exiles were about to raid the island. Returning to the first rule of Florida politics, the Bush campaign is circulating copies of a column Mr Buchanan wrote in 1983 suggesting that contributing to social security (pensions) should be made optional. That should fix him.
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES: 148. Best tip for a Democratic candidate who has not won New Hampshire: get the votes of Florida Democratic activists at their party convention in December, and hang on to them. Mr Clinton has done so, and his juggernaut--despite some lurches--remains on the road. Not only is his state effort headed by Florida's popular lieutenant-governor, Kenneth ""Buddy"" MacKay, but Mr Clinton has the still-solid backing of 50 of the state's 67 local party chiefs. Caveat: party organisations in the state are notoriously weak. Walter Mondale also had such support when he was hammered by Gary Hart in 1984.
Best tip for a Democrat who has won New Hampshire, but has also suggested (that ""Call to Economic Arms"" again) that federal spending might be cut by reducing automatic cost-of-living increases for social security by 1%: aim at small, potentially friendly areas (districts in the liberal southeast, or university towns where the young hang out) and blanket them with 30-second television commercials.
Do not go overboard on the swimming.
MASSACHUSETTS
REPUBLICAN DELEGATES: 38. Republican tip: take it easy. Missouri (47) and Tennessee (45) each offer more Super-Tuesday delegates. Mr Buchanan has the endorsement of the tabloid Boston Herald; but Massachusetts Republicans are notoriously moderate and satisfied with Mr Bush, who conveniently comes from New England as well as Texas.
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES: 94. The third prize on Super Tuesday, but still worth winning. Democratic tip: oil that machine. In 1988, as the sitting governor, Michael Dukakis had instant organisation. Mr Tsongas, by contrast, has run only one state-wide race, for the Senate 14 years ago. State Democratic leaders have not rallied to him, and he does not seem to fire the blood. The drubbing Mr Dukakis received in 1988 remains a painful memory. Mr Tsongas may have to prove to the rest of the country that he is not just another ""Greek from Massachusetts""; but he will have to work harder than most favourite sons to do as well at home as everyone expects."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224153976/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/14?accountid=14657,"The scene is a New York courtroom. John Gotti, the head of the Gambino Mafia family, is on trial. Salvatore Gravano, once his consigliere, now a stool-pigeon, is testifying against him. Mr Gotti cracks--""It's an outrage, it's a dirty double-crossing back-stabbing thing to do. For him to do this to me is an act of dishonour,"" he yells.
Right quote, wrong person. The man with the Mafiosi mouth was not the Dapper Don at all, but Slick Willie: Bill Clinton, the governor of Arkansas and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. And why did he come so close to saying that the object of his rage would soon sleep with the fishes? Because he thought he was in danger of losing the black vote in the Democratic primaries, that's why.
Mr Clinton's outburst came before an open microphone in a television studio, after an interviewer had erroneously given him the impression that Tom Harkin, a rival of his for the nomination, had been endorsed by Jesse Jackson. In 1984 and (especially) 1988, when he won nearly 7m votes in Democratic primaries, Mr Jackson had shown himself able to mobilise blacks for a presidential campaign like no one else. Mr Clinton's outburst was twice revealing: first, in showing how important black support is to him; and second, in showing how long a shadow Mr Jackson still casts.
The unspoken assumption behind Mr Clinton's anger was that, although Mr Jackson is not running this year, the black vote was his to dispose of--or, at the least, that an endorsement by Mr Jackson of someone else would be so powerful that it would do Mr Clinton harm. This assumption of Mr Jackson's importance was not Mr Clinton's alone. No sooner had he stuck his foot in his mouth than St. Paul Tsongas, his main rival for the nomination, as airing commercials on black radio stations saying, among much else, ""Paul Tsongas doesn't go around attacking respected national leaders like Jesse Jackson."" As for Mr Harkin himself, he has tried to rescue his flagging campain by padding through South Carolina in Mr Jackson's footsteps. And Jerry Brown has said that, if nominated, he would ask Mr Jackson to be his running mate (""Jerry and Jesse""--it has a ring to it).
In the event, the impact of Mr Clinton's gaffe was far smaller than many pundits had predicted. Mr Clinton was endorsed by Kurt Schmoke, the black mayor of Baltimore, and by the whole of the black political establishment in Atlanta. In both Maryland and Georgia he won the black vote easily. Offending Mr Jackson (which Mr Clinton has done many times before) does not seem to have done the governor much obvious harm.
Working out why that might be is a fascinating exercise. In the absence of Mr Jackson, the message sent to black voters by the Democratic campaign is very different from that sent when he led his poor people's crusades in 1984 and 1988. Both Mr Clinton and Mr Tsongas believe that economic growth must precede the elimination of inequality; both rallied against a Washington party establishment which they see as pledged to liberal special-interest groups (code, in some parts of the country, for a party that is too kind to blacks). Both have had associations with groups that are less than popular among Mr Jackson's supporters. Mr Clinton used to be chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a self-styled ""moderate"" pressure group. Mr Tsongas is a boardroom lawyer.
At the same time, both Mr Tsongas (with his message that all Americans are part of ""the same team"") and Mr Clinton (with his stress on the American ""community"") use lanuage that is designed to convince blacks that they have not been forgotten.
STIRRING UP APATHY
Both men have made vehement and undoubtedly sincere condemnations of the racism that they believe is at the heart of the candidacy of Pat Buchanan: racism which they suspect will be a part of George Bush's own campaign in the autumn, just as it became a subliminal part of it in the autumn of 1988. In essence, both men are saying to blacks: ""Economically, we are more consenrative than the Democratic candidates, white or black, whom you have supported in the past--men like Hubert Humprey, Walter Mondale and Jesse Jackson. We are not promising anything special for you; we think that what is good for the American economy as a whole is also good for blacks. But we are no less committed to civil rights or opposed to racism than your heroes of years past.""
How this line sells among blacks is going to be one of the most intriguing questions of 1992. It is hard to see how it is going to bring in many more black votes for the Democrats than in 1988, when Michael Dukakis won about 90% of the black vote. It may woo a few economically conservative blacks who voted for Mr Bush or abstained in 1988, but those numbers are not significant.
Of course, this year's strategy may appeal (indeed, may be designed to appeal) to white voters who did not much like Mr Bush but did not support Mr Dukakis either, because he was the candidate of Mr Jackson's party. But this boost from white voters could come at a price: its reverse may be that blacks simply do not go to the polls in the numbers that Democrats need to win the presidential election. Without Mr Jackson in the field, the turnout in Georgia on March 3rd was significantly lower than in 1988. If that is an omen for November--if large numbers of black voters just withdraw from politics entirely this year--it would be bad for the Democratic Party. It would be worse for America."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224141942/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/15?accountid=14657,"After decades of shunning foreign trade and investment, India is welcoming the world. On February 29th, in his second budget in eight months, Manmohan Singh, the finance minister in the Congress Party government, made the rupee partly convertible; abolished non-tariff curbs on most imports; cut import duties; legalised gold imports; encouraged foreign participation in oil and gas; and allowed foreign pension funds to invest in Indian shares. Nehru would have had a fit.
But will the world welcome India? The answer depends on India's willingness to stay on the liberalising path it took after last June's elections. Hence the importance of Mr Singh's budget. There may be quibbles that the ceiling on import duties, lowered from 150%, is still a daunting 110% (except for rates of 60% and 30% on some machinery), but Mr Singh's bravery is undeniable.
Take, for example, income tax, which Indian businessmen tend to evade with bribes and false accounts. Mr Singh, while abolishing many exemptions, is slashing the maximum rate from 50% to 40% and setting lower bands of 30% and 20%; he has also ended wealth tax on shares. Since matching cuts in company tax can be expected once an expert committee has submitted its recommendations, India could soon have tax rates to compete with neighbours which in economic terms have long outstripped it.
So far so good in theory. The reality is that lower tariffs will mean losing perhaps a tenth of customs revenues hitherto deemed essential. To recoup part of the loss, Mr Singh is raising duties on domestic output. More bravely, given India's tradition of socialism, he is cutting spending.
Under his agreement last year with the IMF, Mr Singh had already cut the budget deficit from 8.4% of GOP in the past fiscal year to 6.5% in the present one; now he is to cut it to 5% for 1992-93. This means a sharp drop in capital spending. It also means ending state monopolies and giving private business, including foreign companies, greater scope.
The difficulty is that under its reformist helmsman the economy is sailing into choppy waters. The liberal measures of Mr Singh's first budget have brought stagflation. Mr Singh had promised industrial growth of around 4% with inflation limited to 9%. Instead, manufacturing has shrunk and inflation is running at 12-16%, depending on which index you believe. Having gone virtually bust, India needs dynamic exports to reduce its dependence on foreign debt, but exports have fallen this year thanks largely to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Opponents of reform who had argued that an IMF-dictated adjustment programme would bring pain without gain gleefully claim vindication.
Mr Singh faces such critics within his own party. A leak to the press about the conditions attached to a structural-adjustment loan from the World Bank has raised a furore in Parliament. The opposition says India's sovereignty has been eroded because the budget was determined by the World Bank and the IMF.
In which case, Mr Singh is cast as a traitor, selling the country to foreign bankers. Happily, he continues to have the confidence of the prime minister, Narasimha Rao, and will probably ride out the storm provided he curbs inflation in the coming year. To do that he will have to be much sterner in budgetary discipline next year (the pledge to the IMF was met only by creative accounting). He therefore needs a recovery of the world economy to boost exports--and this is not yet in sight.
Meanwhile, the pace of reforms has been breathtaking. The Rao government has slashed red tape, liberalised trade, made exports attractive through devaluation, wooed foreign investment, loosened interest rates and encouraged private business to replace the public sector as the dynamo of the economy. It has built up its foreign-exchange reserves from almost nothing to more than $4 billion, mostly through amnesties to Indians with illegal hoards abroad. The rupee is to be fully convertible in three to five years.
But the government has yet to grasp two nasty nettles--the need to shed surplus labour and close sick industries, and the need to restructure the inefficient public sector. India's trade unions believe that jobs should be forever, that automation is a wicked device to cut employment, and that wage demands should be related to class war rather than productivity. Public employees have threatened to strike if there is privatisation. All political parties, including Mr Rao's Congress, have a strong trade-union wing.
Mr Rao has operated so far by consensus, which allows no open confrontation with trade unions. With the help of the World Bank, a fund is being created to give a golden handshake to surplus workers, but the unions recently refused even to look at a government proposal to give several years' pay as redundancy compensation.
Such obstinacy does not bode well for Messrs Rao and Singh. Nor does the weather. After four good monsoons in a row a drought might seem overdue, with its attendant inflation and unrest. If they come, the opposition parties, which have not wanted a fresh election so soon after the last one, may decide it is time to try to topple the government. They may not succeed, even though Congress and its allies are seven votes short of a majority in Parliament. But the uncertainty is one reason why commercial banks still do not regard India as creditworthy. They reckon that, though the Indian economy is eminently rescuable, its polity may not be."

Employers are saying that times are hard, and meaning it. Growth could be as low as 1.7%, according to the soothsayers. In the round of pay bargaining now starting, bosses are talking of rises of no more than 2%. Bonuses this summer are likely to be the smallest for a decade.
This is bad news not only for the luckless seekers of more money, but also for the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. During the four months he has had the job Mr Miyazawa has had to take the flak for two political-bribery scandals, which are still far from being resolved. Now the economy turns out to be suffering even more than was previously imagined. No wonder the prime minister's approval rating is falling, down from 55% in November to 32% in the most recent opinion poll.
His government is desperate to show that it is doing something urgent about the economy in general, and pay packets in particular. This means getting pump-priming money into public works quickly. The money has been allocated in the budget for the financial year starting on April 1st. But if the budget is to be approved by the Diet (parliament) before then, deals have to be done with the opposition parties left, right and centre. Otherwise, stop-gap measures will have to be taken to scrape enough money together to pay teachers, police, health workers and other officials. Such a course would make the government look even more inept.
The opposition parties have been harassing the government mercilessly. They blocked deliberations on the budget until Mr Miyazawa agreed that senior politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party could be questioned in the Diet about bribery allegations. Two former cabinet members, one of them an ex-prime minister, Zenko Suzuki, gave evidence on February 25th. Both admitted having received money from Kyowa, a steel-frame company accused of bribing a former cabinet minister, Fumio Abe, to help it win building projects. The Liberal Democrats have now had to agree to a far more embarrassing demand, for Mr Abe to testify as well. Not only was Mr Abe a close ally of Mr Miyazawa, but also one of his party faction's biggest bagmen. He is on bail, charged with receiving Y90m ($690,000) in bribes from Kyowa.
The opposition has also demanded that a special Diet committee should be formed to investigate the Kyubin scandal, which promises to eclipse even the Recruit affair of 1989. The Tokyo branch of Sagawa Kyubin, Japan's second largest delivery firm, is alleged to have greased the palms of some 130 politicians.
To add to his misery, the socialists are demanding that Mr Miyazawa should cut proposed defence spending in the budget. Before this demand, the government was proposing to increase the defence bill by 3.8%, the lowest rise since 1960. If the socialists are to be appeased, the rise will be less than 1%. The opposition parties are also demanding a cut in the mid-term defence plan for 1991-95. The Americans are worried. James Lilley, who watches over international security for the Pentagon, was due in Tokyo on March 6th to hear what the government has to say.
America, and other countries, are no doubt surprised that the government has dumped the legislation that would have allowed Japanese servicemen to take part in United Nations peacekeeping work abroad. It was supposed to have been the cornerstone of the country's new foreign policy. But critics said it would be a step towards militarism.
With the opposition apparently contented for the moment, deliberations on the budget got going again on March 2nd. The government is braced, not too hopefully, for some crucial by-elections. The first is on March 8th, in Miyagi. Another is in Gunma later this month, and a third in Ibaraki in April. If the ruling party fares as poorly in these as it did at Nara in February, when its candidate was trounced, it can say goodbye to loosening the opposition's hold on the upper house in July's election.
Time and the opposition permitting, Mr Miyazawa does hope to get a measure of political reform enacted before the Diet session ends in June. This will include some redrawing of electoral boundaries and tighter restrictions on campaign funds. But the by-election in Miyagi this Sunday could seal his fate."

China's Communist Party and Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party--the Kuomintang--have a common ancestry. Any good Leninist would get a warm feeling from the Kuomintang's organisational chart, which boasts a Central Committee, a Standing Committee and four-yearly Party Congresses. And, as in China, party gatherings still overshadow mere elected bodies. On March 20th Taiwan's first freely elected National Assembly, a sort of perpetual constitutional convention with a few other powers, begins a two-month session during which it is to rewrite the island's constitution. The action to watch, however, will take place elsewhere. On March 14th the Kuomintang Central Committee begins its first plenary meeting in two years.
The acknowledged purpose of the meeting is to give the Kuomintang members of the National Assembly their voting orders. But the constitutional debate in the Central Committee will be a struggle in disguise between the party's two rival factions.
These are known as ""mainstream"" and ""non-mainstream""; more descriptive tags might be ""non-mainland"" and ""mainland"". The dividing line of Kuomintang--and Taiwanese--politics runs between the native-born of the island, who account for some 85% of the population, and the descendants of the soldiers, bureaucrats and party men who fled China with Chiang Kaishek when the communists won the civil war in 1949. For 40 years the mainlanders controlled the Kuomintang. But the careful democratisation of the party executed in the mid-1980s by President Chiang Ching-kuo, the old general's son, loosened their grip enough so that when Chiang the younger died, in 1988, he was succeeded by a native-born Taiwanese, Lee Teng-hui.
President Lee, whose Japanese (he grew up when Taiwan was a Japanese colony, and studied in Japan) is said to be a trifle more fluent than his Mandarin, is head of both the Kuomintang and of its mainstream faction. The mainlanders' most conspicuous champion is Hau Pei-tsun, the prime minister--and no friend of Mr Lee.
Both factions will try at the Central Committee meeting to place their people in high party positions. At the moment the mainlanders have a disproportionate share. The 180-strong Central Committee, for instance, has only 54 Taiwanese. The Taiwanese, however, have 16 of the 31 Standing Committee seats. With Mr Lee as head of the party and James Soong--a mainlander who is nonetheless in the mainstream--as party secretary-general, the mainstream faction also controls the party apparatus. This is a big asset in an organisation as respectful of hierarchy as the Kuomintang.
The meeting could still be dangerous for Mr Lee and his allies. The previous plenum of the Central Committee, in 1990, produced an embarrassingly large number of votes for someone other than Mr Lee to be the party's presidential candidate. His ideal would be a brief session on constitutional amendments; no voting to change the Standing Committee; and a decision to hold the party congress in the summer.
The mainlanders want to delay the congress until next year, and meanwhile vote on a new Standing Committee. They reason that, after a general election in December, they will have enough new blood to persuade the congress that they deserve more seats on the Central Committee.
But assume a successful compromise, and still the great question in Taiwan's political life will be unresolved: what the island's relations with the mainland ought to be. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party was trounced by the Kuomintang in the National Assembly election last December when it ran on what amounted to a pro-independence platform. That showed electoral pragmatism: why provoke China by flaunting something you already have?
Yet sooner or later the tension between Taiwanese and Chinese nationalism will have to be faced--all the sooner, ironically, if China reforms itself both quickly and successfully. No one in China thinks of Taiwan as anything but a renegade province that will eventually be rejoined to China. An intriguing sub-faction of second-generation mainlanders in the Kuomintang--the New Kuomintan Alliance--are all for direct trade and investment with the mainland, something their elders still recoil from as too much of a security risk.
The youngsters, having studied at places like Harvard with their second generation counterparts from the mainland, feel that they can easily work with the hereditary elite preparing to take over in Beijing. The prospect is unlikely to appeal to the 85% of Taiwanese who are not mainlanders, no matter how capitalist China becomes."

At least $200m will be spent by politicians campaining in Thailand's general election, due to be held on March 22nd. That, anyway, is the prediction of General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, a former supreme commander of the Thai armed forces who is now leader of the New Aspiration Party.
General Chavalit believes, and many Thais would agree with him, that nothing fundamental has changed in politics since the coup of February last year. He says that, going on past experience, after the army stages a coup it organises elections, then it stages a coup against the elections. ""This sort of vicious circle means that politicians don't develop a sense of democracy and it becomes normal practice for them to buy themselves into office.""
The irony of the past year is that the government appointed by the junta could turn out to be one of the best Thailand has had. Anand Panyarachun, a former diplomat and chairman of one of Thailand's blue-chip companies, accepted the job of prime minister. The junta saw him as a civilian figurehead. However, his government has pushed 169 pieces of legislation through the parliament appointed by the junta. (The previous, elected, government passed 49 bills in 1990.) He has brought in a value-added tax, cut tariffs on a wide variety of goods, cut duties on cars to stimulate the domestic industry, drafted a patents law and set up a new system for evaluating large infrastructure projects.
Although the government wins praise for making the economy more open and efficient, some plutocrats who benefited from the old ways are prepared to spend money on the election campaign with the idea of trying to turn the clock back afterwards. Of the three biggest parties in the contest, Samakkhi Tham has close connections with the army. The other two, Chart Thai and the Social Action Party are led by men who played a leading role in the previous civilian government, which set new levels of corruption. Over the past year both have promoted military men to senior positions.
Then there are the Democrats, who usually do well among Bangkok's educated middle class, but are too clever by half to appeal to rural people. Palang Dharma is led by Chamlong Srimuang, an ascetic celibate who stood down as governor of Bangkok to fight the election. He appeals to many city people because he has fought against corruption, but his party's appeal outside Bangkok is, like the Democrats', limited.
General Chavalit's party hopes to do well in the poor north-east of Thailand. There is little love lost between the general and his former subordinates in the armed forces. Some Thais may vote for him in order to register their resentment of the coup. However, the rift between General Chavalit and the current leaders of the army ensures that were the New Aspiration Party to do well enough to lead a coalition--admittedly an unlikely outcome--there would certainly be another coup.
No party talks about policies--most do not have any--and most Thais are not interested in the election. It is a dispiriting conclusion, but Thais do not expect the standard of their politicians' behaviour to improve in the near future. Anyway, what Thai politicians do is of less consequence than it might be in another country. Thailand is one of the least governed countries in Asia. In 1990 government spending was only 13.4% of GDP, the lowest proportion of any of the Asian Development Bank's members, which include supposedly laisser-faire Hong Kong.
The other side of this coin is that Thailand's government services are none too good. Hence the main lesson learned by Mr Anand after a year in office: ""Thai people are really hard to please."" It is a lesson that Mr Anand's successor, whoever he may be, will also have to learn."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224161940/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/19?accountid=14657,"Marx is out and marksmanship back in for China's armed forces. After more than two years of ideological brain-bashing by nervous Communist Party commissars, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as China calls its soldiers, sailors and airmen, is getting back to square-bashing and other martial pursuits.
With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, China's 3.2m-strong armed forces are probably now the world's largest. But the Gulf war showed that numbers count for less than modern technologies and weapons. This realisation is pushing the PLA back into business in more ways than one.
According to provisional figures collected by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, last year China moved up from fifth to fourth in the league of big arms-traders, behind America, the ex-Soviet Union and Germany. Among armourers of poor countries, however, China ranked third, taking almost 10% of the market. The volume of sales is well below that of either America or the ex-Soviet Union, and still below the peak years of the 1980s, when China made a killing, literally, by selling to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war. But in a year when Soviet arms sales plunged to a third of their 1990 level and even America's tally slipped, China's arms-traders saw their sales rise by almost one-fifth.
The extra revenue is welcome. Despite inflation-beating increases of more than 12% in the official defence budget in each of the past two years, the PLA can afford only a fraction of the equipment it would like. Buying sophisticated weapons off the shelf is too expensive. China prefers to do deals, including with western companies, that give it the technology to produce its own weapons. Secret collaboration between China and Israel has helped China to upgrade its tanks and improve the accuracy of its missiles. Weapons-hungry Pakistan and Syria are thought to have financed development of China's new M-9 and M-11 shorter-range missiles (both of which break the export guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime which China now says it will abide by). Iran may have helped China with in-flight refuelling technology in return for help with its own arms industry.
But China's weapons production still lags far behind its ambition. One palliative is to reduce demand. China's 87-year-old strongman, Deng Xiaoping, is said to favour cutting the PLA's manpower by 1m (on top of the 1m cut announced in 1985). In the longer term that will make for a leaner and meaner fighting force. In the short term, however, resettling and retraining demobbed soldiers costs money--much of it from the PLA's budget.
Hence the importance of weapons sales, which supplement military funds and bring in hard currency. In recent years modernisation of the navy and the air force has taken priority and most of the cash. Last year China agreed to purchase a squadron of 24 SU-27 fighter aircraft from the then Soviet Union. Despite the hiccup caused by the Moscow putsch last August, the sale is going through and some 200 Chinese pilots have begun their training in Russia.
Although the disintegration of the Soviet Union sent tremors through China's political establishment, China's defence chiefs may now have the chance to snap up more modern weapons at bargain prices. Several ex-Soviet republics, including Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, have said they will sell off surplus stocks. China may be in the market for more aircraft. Like India, it has expressed an interest in an aircraft carrier, the Varyag, which is being built at a Ukrainian shipyard and is now not needed.
And why might China want such shiny new weapons? Last month China reiterated its claim to a series of islands and island groups, from Taiwan and the Senkaku islands (claimed also by Taiwan and Japan), to the Spratly islands in the South China Sea (claimed also by Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines). If China is ever to back these claims by sustainable force it will need warships like the Varyag and more long-range aircraft. The more of its home-made weapons China can sell abroad, the more fancy new ones it can acquire for real target practice."

Libya's copy-cat ruler, it implies, has even been competing in the odium stakes, pretending that he, like Mr Hussein, is big and bad enough to merit a trade embargo.
Saddam Hussein and Moammar Qaddafi prefer to think of themselves as representing the true voice of the Arab street. But Uday, a chip off the Hussein block, has a point in drawing attention to less enviable links between the otherwise dissimilar rulers. Both are under orders from the United Nations Security Council to do things they want not to do. One has been suffering from stiff sanctions for the past 18 months; the other is trying to dodge the imposition of a milder variety. Both are worried that the United States, probably with British and French help, will resort to military action.
Mr Hussein indeed takes priority. The latest twist in the battle of wits between the Iraqi regime and the UN inspectors who, under the terms of the ceasefire resolution, are supposed to be destroying Iraqi weapons has caused a flurry of ultimatums and missed deadlines.
The inspectors were prevented, at the end of February, from destroying equipment that had been used to make Scud ballistic missiles; the Iraqis claimed that the equipment could be modified for civilian use or to make the short-distance missiles that Iraq is still allowed to have. The Security Council gave the Iraqis 24 hours to destroy the plant; the Iraqis continued to argue and the council prolonged the deadline to the week that begins on March 9th. By then a 15-man Iraqi team, led by Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister, will have arrived in New York for an all-day discussion with the council on March 11th.
Mr Aziz will argue that, since Iraq is complying with the rules on weapons destruction, the Security Council should help it out by relaxing the trade ban that prevents it from selling its oil; the ceasfire resolution says that sanctions should automatically end once Iraq has destroyed the banned weapons. The council, while not wanting attention to stray from the vexed business of dual-use equipment, is ready to confront Mr Aziz on all related issues. The ceasefire resolution, it will say, does not allow for a little compliance in return for a little trade flexibility; sanctions will end only when Iraq has ""completed all actions"" on the weapons and weapon programmes, including checks on future arms building.
Despite Iraq's best evasions, the weapons inspectors have done pretty well. The programme for destroying chemical weapons is going ahead fast, with Iraq's good cooperation (the identified but undestroyed chemical material has become an environmental danger), and the International Atomic Energy agency reports that Iraq is offering ""better co-operation"" on the nuclear front than in the past. But a fair amount of ballistic stuff is still missing. More important, there is no agreement, as yet, on long-term inspection.
The Iraqis, squeezed for food, medicine and clean water, curse the West. The Security Council will try to pin the blame on Mr Hussein by pointing out that March 19th marks the end of the six-month period in which Iraq was supposed to have exchanged its oil for humanitarian goods under a UN-controlled arrangement, but has declined to do so. Iraq could earn money if it wanted to, the Security Council will say. But, since it is not, the United States is urging the seizure of Iraq's foreign assets in order to pay war reparations and the UN's own expenses. Mr Aziz, in his turn, will argue for the adoption of a much more flexible oil-for-food arrangement to take Iraq through the next six months.
The Security Council has the option of declaring that, since Iraq has not fulfilled the ceasefire resolution (which has clauses on a far wider range of subjects than weapons destruction), the ceasefire itself is now void. UN members with the stomach for it could then make the case that military action against Iraq can be resumed without more ado. But the probability is that an armed strike will be kept as a threat, in reserve against some worse behaviour on Iraq's part. The gamble for Mr Hussein is how bad he can be; for the Security Council, how often it can cry ""wolf"".
If America, Britain and France are a mite ahead of their fellow council members in urging a tough response to Iraqi prevarication, they are miles ahead in pressing for similar toughness against Libya. Somewhat to their surprise, they got a unanimous vote requiring a ""full and effective response"" to their demand that the Libyans should hand over the two men suspected of causing the explosion that blew up a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie in December 1988, and the four men similarly suspected of blowing up a French UTA airliner over Niger in September 1989. They will be lucky if they get much more than the required minimum of nine votes if they push, after they have dealt with Mr Aziz, for a resolution punishing Libya for non-compliance. The expected punishment is an embargo on arms sales and on civil aviation, plus a reduction in diplomatic relations.
Battling the threat of sanctions, Mr Qaddafi has sent a confusing multi-tiered response to the Security Council. In conversation with the UN's special envoy, Vasily Saffronchuk, the Libyan again offered to have the men tried in an international court or in a neutral country (though no such court exists and no neutral country is likely to touch so hot a potato). But he added, almost in a throwaway line, that he might hand the Lockerbie two to the United States if it would agree to normalise its almost non-existent relations with Libya.
This suggests that Mr Qaddafi may be on the point of overcoming the legal obstacles to extradition--though at the same time he is challening the extradition demand at the World Court. The evidence is contradictory and America, which insists that the Security Council injunction should be obeyed unconditionally, is paying no attention to his inconsequential musings.
In Libya the West's firmness is seen as moving the goalposts; the Americans, argue some Libyans, want Mr Qaddafi's head, not his compliance. The Iraqis say the same thing about Mr Hussein, with better reason.
President George Bush has made it plain that he equates Iraqi good behaviour with getting rid of Saddam Hussein. Yet--and here again is another parallel--there are worries about the succession. Who wants a pro-Iranian Shia regime in Iraq, or Islamic fundamentalists in Libya?
The temperature has been raised in Libya by panicky preparations against a repetition of America's air raid on Tripoli in 1986 (see box above). But, as Uday Hussein would say, such expectations may be beyond Libya's station. And, even in an election year, most Americans are hesitant about a resumption of fireworks.
BLOOD SWEAT AND FEARS
A distraught and sick-looking Moammar Quaddafi warned students at Tripoli's Al Fatah university that the Americans wanted to overthrow him and impose a ""client"" government. He talked of suicide and told students that they would have to defend themselves even if thousands were killed.
Libya's specific fear is a commando attack by the 400 or so Libyans who were trained in the 1980s by the CIA in Chad to overthrow Mr Qaddafi, and are now back in the United States via Kenya. Beach fortifications have been erected to repel a sea invasion. Soldiers are in a state of alert, exercising in their barracks.
The country is also preparing itself for sanctions. Increased activity in Tripoli harbour, with 15 ships--far more than normal--being unloaded last week, testifies to the stockpiling of imports. Since November (when the Lockerbie suspects were first named), the country has bought enough food, spare parts and refined petroleum to last at least a year. Warehouses are full but, with people hoarding, shops are empty. Investment has been shifted to countries considered safe.
About three-quarters of Libya's 3.5m people are under 30 and have known no other system than Mr Qaddafi's bizarre ""third universal theory"". The system floats along on its oil wealth (even with low oil prices Libya is earning $18m a day) and, materially, Libyans lack for little--though many government salaries have not been raised for five years. Goods are bartered across the borders with Egypt and Tunisia. Retail trade has already been liberalised and, some time in the future, there is to be discussion on opening up the creaking public sector.
Life is more relaxed for most Libyans than it used to be. The sinister Revolutionary Committees have been reined in, and scruffy youths armed with pistols no longer man their own road-blocks. The security services--at least ten different branches still operate--concentrate their attention on people suspected of fundamentalist leanings. Libyans say that there are ""thousands"" of Islamic prisoners held ten to a cell in underground prisons, and that there have been an unknown number of disappearances"".
Mr Qaddafi makes no bones about his feelings towards Islamic militants. In a speech three years ago he demanded that they be pursued and killed. In a speech to lawyers last October he called fundamentalists ""heretics"" and ""imperialist lackeys"" who could expect no legal protection and who should be ""done away with once and for all"".
Libya takes a less scatter-gun approach than it used to in helping revolutionary groups worldwide. Mr Qaddafi has toned down his anti-West speeches and was moderate during the Gulf war. He reiterates that he stopped supporting the Irish Republican Army when he found out that it was a terrorist organisation. Last December Libya is said to have turned back a shipment of arms from Sudan destined for the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria. But, since it had earlier helped the same group, Libya's policy remains ambiguous, it concentrates on backing marginal ethnic and even ecological groups with ""unorthodox but less directly terrorist methods."""

At their peace talks in Washington Israelis and Palestinians have discovered otherwise. Neither side expected to agree about the ownership of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Each claims these territories for itself. But it did not seem impossible to start work on an interim arrangement for the territories, agreeing for a while to disagree about final ownership. By March 4th, however, when the latest talks adjourned, even this idea was looking ragged.
In principle, both sides are at one on, and stand to gain from, an interim period of Palestinian self-government. Israel could inch towards peace with its neighbours, and end the Palestinian uprising, without having formally to abandon its claim to, and overall control of, the occupied territories. The Palestinians, meanwhile, could shake off the burden of Israeli military government and run their own affairs, postponing but not dropping their claim to statehood. An added bonus is the existence, in the Egyptian-Israeli Camp David accords of 1978, of a pre-negotiated framework for the interim period.
There is agreement, too, on the timetable: five years for self-government, with negotiation on the territories' final status to begin within three years of the start of the interim period. On almost every other aspect, alas, the two sides are miles apart. In Washington it has become apparent that each wants to shape the interim period so as to be sure of getting its own way when the time for a final settlement arrives.
For the Palestinians, this means pressing hard right away for most of the powers of a state. Their opening position was to ask for the establishment of a Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority (PISGA) with full legislative, executive and judicial powers. Its authority would derive from free elections and not from any ""outside source"". It would have full control of the land, water and air-space of all the territories occupied since 1967. Israeli troops would have to withdraw from all populated areas before elections for PISGA were held, and then to the border by the time the new authority is installed. United Nations peacekeeping forces, and a strong Palestinian police force, would ensure security and public order.
Israel's proposal for the interim period is strikingly different. It offers self-governing arrangements for Arab inhabitants of the territories but insists on keeping intact ""the established links between Judea, Samaria, Gaza district and Israel"". Israelis would continue ""as of right"" to live and settle there. Althouh there would be Palestinian policemen, to look after criminal affairs, the sole responsibility for security in all its aspects would be Israel's. The Palestinian authority would be allowed to promulgate regulations on specific matters, but Israel would remain the source of authority, and existing laws applied in the territories would remain in force.
Neither set of opening proposals bears a close resemblance to the ideas mapped out by Egypt and Israel in the Camp David accords. The Palestinians loathed Camp David and all its works, so feel the need to press for something more generous. Under Camp David, for example, the Israeli army was to move from urban areas into specified security zones, but there was no question of its leaving the territories altogether during the self-government period, or of letting in forces from the UN. On March 3rd, while sugesting that elections for PISGA might take place at the end of September, the Palestinians hardened their demands. They are now hinting among other things, that PISGA should be allowed to have its own foreign policy.
Israel, meanwhile, persists in offering less than it offered at Camp David. The notion of withdrawing into security zones has disappeared from its proposals. This is partly, Israel says, because the number of Israelis living in the territories has multiplied by ten since Camp David, and that they all need protection. No wonder the Arabs, and Americans, want that settlement freeze."

The skipper, Canada's prime minister, Brian Mulroney, has kept clear of the helm since the previous constitutional effort, at Meech Lake, capsized in June 1990. But Joe Clark, the minister for constitutional affairs, has devised a new way of keeping the mutinous Quebeckers aboard ship. At his behest, on February 28th, a committee of ten senators and 20 members of Parliament produced what was needed: a balanced list of proposals for the summer's federal provincial negotiations.
The Meech Lake accord failed partly because of doubts about how Quebec would treat non-French-speakers if given constitutional powers as a ""distinct society"". Canadians also disliked the secretive way in which Mr Mulroney and the ten provincial premiers had tried to settle the nation's future behind closed doors. The government has therefore taken, with a Canadian vengeance, to mass consultation. First a hectic Citizens' Forum canvassed the views of about 400,000 Canadians. Then Mr Clark's Senate-Commons committee set out to test public reaction to 28 government proposals supposedly distilled from the previous consultation.
The committee chaired at the start by Dorothy Dobbie and Claude Castonguay began by almost falling apart. In Manitoba it failed to attract witnesses. Mr Castonguay resigned and was replaced by Senator Gerald Beaudoin. A huge argument arose from the demand that Canada's aboriginal peoples should be recognised as ""distinct societies"", just like Quebec. Yet the Dobbie-Beaudoin report is upbeat: ""We have a new sense of hope and optimism for our country,"" it says.
The report proposes more decentralisation than even the Meech Lake accord allowed for, and new limits to federal spending powers which, it says, have sometimes been ""a blunt instrument used to impose federal programmes on unwilling provinces"". It takes for granted Quebec's status as a distinct society, suggesting that a constitutional amendment should affirm the province's jurisdiction in cultural affairs. The committee went beyond Meech Lake in accepting that the Inuit and Indian peoples have an inherent right to self-government within Canada, to be given reality by treaties and tribunals. It proposes that the Senate should be elected proportional representation, which might bring more women into Parliament, but fails to say how the Commons might override a Senate vote.
The endless debate surges on. Next, provincial ministers of intergovernmental affairs will meet to flush out objections to the report, starting with Alberta's contention that Quebec's powers should be the same as eveybody else's. In April, at last, the federal government has promised to say what it wants. Mr Mulroney will chair a meeting of premiers. Since the Meech Lake gathering Qeuebec's premier, Robert Bourassa, has kept away from such get-togtethers. He will no doubt play hard to get until the last possible moment, just ahead of the provincial referendum he is sworn to call in October."

So read the banners in February 1988, when the first mass demonstrations in Armenia over the fate of this disputed mountainous enclave began to shake the foundations of Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union. Four years and perhaps 2,000 deaths later, the battle between Armenians and Azeris for control of Nagorno-Karabakh, populated by Christian Armenians but controlled by Muslim Azerbaijan, could eventually bring the new edifice of the Commonwealth of Independent States crashing down.
Boris Yeltsin's adviser on ethnic affairs, Galina Staravoitova, calls this increasingly savage war a ""litmus test"". ""If the Commonwealth cannot defend the rights of its peoples,"" she says, ""then its members may abandon it."" She is right. Nagorno-Karabakh exemplifies the sort of conflict that organisations far stronger than the Commonwealth have been unable to resolve: in what circumstances should the demands of a minority overrule the laws of the state?
Nagorno-Karabakh is the most easterly part of the area of Armenian settlement. But in 1923 it was incorporated into the (Turkish-speaking) Soviet republic of Azerbaijan in order to placate Turkey's hostility to the Bolshevik state. Today's Armenians in the region believe they are fighting a life-or-death battle to keep their homeland and that Azerbaijan wants to drive them out. Last December they held a referendum on independence from Azerbaijan. The result was unambiguous: 80% turned out to vote, and of those 99% voted for independence. Nagorno-Karabakh subsequently boycotted Azerbaijan's refendum on its own independence three weeks later.
The Azerbaijan government describes the accusation that it wants to drive out the Armenians as nonsense. The dispute, officials say, is a matter of the rule of law and of territorial integrity: the presence of armed Armenian rebels is intolerabe. The Commonwealth of Independent States, the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)--all of which both Armenia and Azerbaijan belong to--declare that borders cannot be changed by force.
This conflict poses a clear challenge to the Commonwealth, not only because it is the obvious forum in which to discuss the dispute, but also because the parliament in Stepanakert has appealed for Nagorno-Karabakh to be admitted to full Commonwealth membership in its own right. Had the appeal been accepted, Azerbaijan would have walked out. But to reject it out of hand without an attempt to mediate would have been a clear admission of political failure. After all, the Commonwealth has plenty more border and ethnic disputes to resolve: in the Crimea, Tatarstan and Checheno-Ingushetia, to name but three.
Last September, while the Soviet Union still existed, the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan (a Christian republic for Armenia, a Muslim one for Azerbaijan) persuaded the two sides to accept a compromise designed to break the murderous deadlock. The Azerbaijanis promised to restore autonomous rule to Nagorno-Karabakh. In rerurn, the Armenians forswore any territorial claims on Azerbaijan (the Armenian parliament had previously passed three resolutions incorporating Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia). Armenia now says the dispute is not between it and Azerbaijan but between Azerbaijan and the minority population in Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia is merely an interested outsider.
But the real problem with using the new Commonwealth as a negotiating forum is that the combatants are unwilling to do so. Azerbaijan sees Russia, which dominates the Commonwealth, as too sympathetic to Armenia. Armenia thinks the Commonwealth's declaration that borders are inviolable means that the grievances of Nagorno-Karabakh's frightened and unhappy people cannot be dealt with.
The Commonwealth's other members show no keenness to get involved. Nor would Armenia and Azerbaijan welcome their efforts, which both would see as interference in their internal affairs. Late last year the Russian-Kazakh agreement came to nothing after a helicopter carrying Commonwealth officials to Nagorno-Karabakh was shot down. Azerbaijan suspected the hand of Armenian militants and retaliated by abolishing the autonomous status of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Commonwealth stood by powerless.
Meanwhile, the collapse of the Soviet Union has made the military problems worse. Looser controls over military supplies mean that a partisans' battle with hunting rifles has turned into a sophisticated modern war with combat helicopters, heat-seeking missiles and tanks. The Commonwealth's hand is further weakened by the decision to withdraw the only potential peacekeeping force in the region. The order to pull out the remaining ex-Soviet troops from Stepanakert was taken no doubt partly to ensure their safety: they have been sitting ducks. But presumably it was also influenced by the decision of Azerbaijan, like Ukraine and Moldavia, to set up its own army. This is bound to make an ex-Soviet presence in this Azerbaijani-ruled enclave increasingly untenable.
The decision to set up an Azerbaijani army also raises the possibility of an all-out attack on Nagorno-Karabakh. On February 25th Armenian fighters took Khojali (see box), an Azeri stronghold that had been shelling Stepanakert. Azerbaijan subsequently offered to shelve its army plans, if militants inside Nagorno-Karabakh were disarmed. But the concession came too late. Armenia has called on its people serving elsewhere in the Commonwealth to return and seems set on building an army, too.
If the purpose of the Commonwealth was to prevent armed conflict breaking out between its members, then it is fast failing. Any further mediation will have to come from outside. In response to appeals from both sides, Turkey, Iran, France, the UN and the CSCE have all been drawn into the conflict as potential mediators.
Iran was first into the field. The millions of ethnic Azeris in Iran are one reason; the effort to present Iran's peaceable credentials to the rest of Central Asia and the world are another. But a ceasefire arranged last month by the Iranian foreign minister collapsed within hours. Turkey came next. Its linguistic and cultural ties to Azerbaijan are closer than Iran's. It is trying to get Azerbaijan to the negotiating table and has asked Russia and several western states to work on Armenia. But the combatants differ both over the mediators they will accept and whether Nagorno-Karabakh should be involed in the talks directly.
For any mediation to work, in Azerbaijan as in Yugoslavia, first the fighting must stop. Having formally given up its claim to Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia seems to have little control over the Armenian irregulars doing the fighting there. Similarly in Azerbaijan the nationalist opposition has rejected a peace plan the president had accepted in talks with America's secretary of state, James Baker. It has forced the resignation of the defence minister and is now calling for the president himself to go. More fighting looks inevitable, and the Commonwealth looks more fragile than ever.
A VIEW TO A SLAUGHTER
Some of the bodies of Azeri refugees slaughtered by Armenian fighters as they tried to escape from the town of Khojali were clearly visible form the helicopter. The town had been captured by the Armenians on February 25th. A week later bodies of men, women and children lay scattered where they had fallen in the bleak snow-covered mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Several had apparently been shot at point-blank range. One survivor told how he had seen Armenians shooting people lying on the ground. Two of the men had been scalped, and one woman's fingers had been hacked off.
About 100 bodies had been brought into the Azeri town of Agdam, although the death toll is almost certainly higher. Many who escaped said they had seen relations killed, but had not yet recovered their bodies.
The massacre is bound to add savagery to what is rapidly becoming a full-scale war between Armenian and Azeri fighters for control of the Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. On March 3rd an Armenian helicopter carring more than 40 people, mainly civilians was shot down as it tried to fly from the enclave to Armenia.
The last ex-Soviet regiment, stationed in Stepanakert, has been ordered to withdraw. Fearing an Azeri onslaught of the soldiers leave, Armenians have tried to blockade the roads. At least one soldier has been killed. Meanwhile a continuous stream of military helicopters ferries men and equipment to the main Soviet military base at Ganja.
The fears of the local Armenian population may well be justified. Azeri forces, supported by heavy armour, have been moving into Agdam. Although the Azeri fighters are split into factions, they may be preparing to launch an offensive into Nagorno-Karabakh as soon as the ex-Soviet forces have withdrawn. The defeat at Khojali has badly stung Azerbaijan's president and former Communist leader, Ayaz Mutalibov. His men want revenge."

Local Serb officials prevented them from using the town hall for the independence referendum on February 29th and March 1st. Their reason? In their own referendum last November Bosnia's Serbs had chosen to stay in Yugoslavia. A decision by the republic's Croat and Muslim majority would not now make them change their minds. ""Two nations cannot force a third to do what it does not want to do,"" one Serb said. ""Besides, we are armed up to here,"" he added, pointing to his chin.
The 4.3m people of Bosnia & Hercegovina are a combustible mixture of Muslims (44%), Serbs (33%) and Croats (17%), according to the latest census, in which people were asked to state their ethnic loyalty or origin. Some Bosnians live in ethnically distinct areas. Most do not, history and inter-marriage having jumbled them together.
Federal Yugoslavia kept Bosnia's ethnic hatreds in check. With that containment vessel smashed, the natural fear is that Bosnia could go the way of Croatia. Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia left Croatian's Serbs cut off from Serbia, giving Serbia a pretext for war. Bosnia's Serbs do not want to be left a minority in an independent Bosnia.
Averting an explosion in Bosnia was one reason Britain and France wanted Germany not to push Europe into recognising Croatia. For, having granted Croatia recognition, how could Europe deny it to Bosnians if independence was what they wanted? In January the European Community played for time. It asked Bosnia to put its call for independence to a referendum. The result was predictable. Three-fifths of the voters took part in the referendum, almost all of them Croats or Muslims. The Serbs stayed away. More than 99% of those who did vote chose indenendence.
On March 1st a man with a Serbian flag was shot dead at his son's wedding in Sarajevo. Within hours the streets of the Bosnian capital--the future headquarters of the United Nations peacekeeping force for Yugoslavia--were deserted except for armed Serbs at hastily erected roadblocks. They wore stocking masks and carried walkie-talkies. The barricades would stay, Serbs boasted, until Bosnia's march to independence was stopped. Several other deaths and many shootings were reported.
Grim as things seem, the hot-heads look unlikely to get the last word this time. Neither the Serbian government in Belgrade nor the federal army is in the mood for another war. The army's commander in Sarajevo called the Serb gunmen bandits and offered Bosnia's government help in taking the barricades down. Within 48 hours they were gone and Sarajevo's traffic was back. Bosnia's Croat and Muslim leaders agreed with their Serb counterparts only that the three should continue EC-sponsored talks on the republic's future.
Before the referendum, these were going well by Yugoslav standards. Bosnia's president, Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim, had agreed that the republic might be reorganised as a confederation of three nationalities. The Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, had accepted that borders should no change, so closing off Serbs' (or Croats') hopes of dismembering Bosnia to their advantage. Whether Bosnia should be fully independent or linked to what remains of Yugoslavia was left open.
The Community's forein ministers would like to put off final recognition of Bosnia until the talks are completed. The aim is to keep everybody's safety-catches on while a constitution is drawn up turning Bosnia & Hercegovina into a looser (and poorer) Balkan Switzerland. Bosnia's neighbours and the generals may not want war. But piloting Bosnia's nationalities to a settlement is going to be hard. Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, was back in Yugoslavia at mid-week for talks to ensure that the introduction of 13,000-14,000 peacekeepers in Croatia was not delayed."

In a fix, he prefers to wait, consult and cogitate before taking decisions. He likes, as he is wont to say, ""to give time to time"". Thus the more people urge him to dump the unpopular Edith Cresson as prime minister, the more resistant he is to doing so.
Indeed, there are reasons why Mr Mitterrand should want to keep her. She is loyal, energetic and has guts. Despite the barrage of criticism from friend and foe alike since her arrival in the job ten months ago, she has not buckled. She has got on with the ""dirty work""--chiefly making unpopular spending cuts--that the president asked her to do. It would only be fair to let her reap some of the expected future rewards, if they come. Besides, for Mr Mitterrand to disavow so soon a prime minister with whom he has been so closely identified would be to admit that he had made a mistake. He does not like to do that.
However, if the Socialists get their expected drubbing in regional elections on March 22nd, the pressure on Mr Mitterrand will be intense. Opinion polls show that a distinct majority of the French would expect at least a change of prime minister in the event of a ""clear defeat"" for the Socialists. Their favourite candidate by far to lead a new government is Jacques Delors, a former finance minister and for the past eight years president of the European Commission in Brussels.
Mr Delors is the most popular politician in France today. According to the latest polls, he is also the only Socialist capable or defeating any of the potential centre-right candidates in a presidential election. The world knows him. He has taken no part in the clan brawls within the Socialist Party. He is untouched by the financial scandals that have tarnished the party of late. His social-democratic convictions would appeal to the centrist vote that Mr Mitterrand is hoping to attract. Many regard him as the Socialists' best--indeed last--hope.
But Mr Delors would be less popular among Socialist insiders, not least with Mr Mitterrand. He is not, unlike Mrs Cresson, a figure of the president's creation. He has strong views, especially about Europe, on which he is much more of a ""federalist"" than Mr Mitterrand. (He recently suggested that France should one day put its nuclear arsenal under European control.) Although Mr Mitterrand has a high regard for Mr Delors's abilities, he is often irritated by him. Nor would the president relish being upstaged by a prime minister more popular than he is himself.
Many Socialists are worried about Mr Delors, not least about his strong Catholic faith. Neither Laurent Fabius, the party leader, nor Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, gets on at all well with him. Nor is it certain that Mr Delors would want the job when Socialist fortunes are at such a low ebb. He has repeatedly said that he intends to serve out at least his present term in Brussels, which ends on December 31st. Still, he might come if called.
If the Socialists are routed on March 22nd, with their vote falling below that of either the National Front or the greens, Mr Mitterrand may try to wheel forward Mr Delors. If the defeat is less than catastrophic, he may try either to keep Mrs Cresson in charge of a much-reshuffled government, or to change prime minister while keeping the main ministerial posts in more or less the same hands.
Several other possible prime ministers have been suggested: Mr Beregovoy; Robert Badinter, a former justice minister who is now president of the Constitutional Council; Pierre Joxe, the defence minister; Roland Dumas, the foreign minister; even Raymond Barre, a centrist former prime minister. Mr Barre may be a more serious contender after next year's parliamentary election, when Mr Mitterrand might try to form a centre-left coalition; Mr Dumas is one of the president's oldest and closest friends, but is probably out of the running. He came in for a great deal of criticism for his role in allowing George Habash, a Palestinian with a terrorist past, into France for medical treatment.
Of the other three, Mr Beregovoy is considered the most likely, because he is competent in economics and popular. Like Mr Delors, however, he may see the job as something of a poisoned chalice. Either Mr Joxe or Mr Badinter would probably accept the job, if asked, out of loyalty to Mr Mitterrand. Each would bring to the office unquestioned integrity at a time when the party's standing is low. None of the three would exactly electrify the voters.
At times like this Mr Mitterrand loves to pull a surprise. He has been in many a tight spot before, and has found a way out. This time the exit is harder to see."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224159805/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/26?accountid=14657,"By most of the usual measures, Kazakhstan ought to be one of the world's great powers. Its territory is five times the size of France. It has perhaps 2,000 deliverable nuclear warheads, 1,500 of them mounted on strategic missiles or long-range bombers. Beneath its vast deserts and stony plateaus are rich deposits of uranium, diamonds, gold, coal, oil and gas. Wheat and meat are produced in the more fertile ""virgin islands"" to the north.
Before the Bolshevik revolution the tsarist conquerors of Alma Ata, the capital, called it Verny, which translates as loyal or faithful. Loyalty has remained the motto of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, who has been the least enthusiastic of the Central Asian leaders to see the old Soviet Union disintegrate. Now head of an independent state, Mr Nazarbaev is tough on political dissent and anxious to keep up close economic ties with Russia.
He is also keen to stop the exodus of Russians from Kazakhstan. He fears that the the break-up of the old Soviet Union could release latent Kazakh nationalism and upset the country's delicate ethnic balance. Some 40% of the 16m inhabitants are Kazakh, another 40% Russian, the rest Ukrainians, Germans, Greeks, Koreans and other minorities moved there by Stalin during and after the second world war. Many of the non-Kazakhs are now leaving (see box). If lots of Russians leave, the economic consequences could be disastrous. Kazakhs are generally the least educated among the population. Most would prefer to keep to what is left of their nomadic pastoral traditions.
Mr Nazarbaev has contained nationalist movements, such as Alash, whose members want Russians to go home and who advocate a revival of Islam. Alash has not been allowed to register as a political party. Some leading members are in jail awaiting trial on charges of insulting the president and disturbing the peace after a fracas in Alma Ata's mosque in December.
If the Commonwealth disintegrates, Kazakhstan's size, its position at the hinge of Europe and Asia, and its natural wealth will guarantee it outside attention. Mr Nazarbaev has been trying to hold the world's attention by saying deliberately ambiguous things about whether Kazakhstan will give up its nuclear weapons. In fact all the missiles in Kazakhstan are still under the control of the ex-Soviet army, which takes its orders from Moscow. Officials admit that they still do not know for sure how many military installations Kazakhstan has.
There is talk of setting up a national army later this year, and asking ethnic Kazakhs serving elsewere in the Commonwealth to return. For the moment Mr Nazarbaev is sweet-talking the ex-Soviet army, offering its officers free land on which to build holiday dachas. But morale is low. Five hundred construction soldiers at a base near the Baikonur space centre mutinied recently in anger at poor living conditions.
Whatever Mr Nazarbaev's feelings, Kazakhs have little to thank the Soviet Union for. Soviet nuclear weapons were tested at Kazakhstan's test site near Semipalatinsk. Elsewhere on the steppes rockets and chemical and biological weapons were tested, creating an environmental mess that will take decades to clean up. Nuclear testing has now stopped. But throughout the country hundreds of thousands of people, most of them ethnic Kazakhs, may be suffering from radiation-induced illnesses.
Kazakhstan now faces a new problem, trying to follow Russia's economic lead. Although the first privatisations are being planned, communist bureaucrats are still very much in control at all levels of government. Mr Nazarbaev is keen to stay in the rouble zone and is opposed to creating a separate currency. For now he wants to continue the old pattern of trade, supplying raw materials to processing factories in Russia and Ukraine, while gradually reversing the unfair pricing system that obliges Kazakhstan to sell cheap and buy dear. He hopes to encourage investment in a domestic food-processing industry, so that locals can make more profitable use of Kazakhstan's wool and leather.
Mr Nazarbaev has said he wants Kazakhstan to become a member of the European Comunity. But he looks to Asia for his economic model. He has appointed a Korean-American economist to advise him. One South Korean businessman has already opened a restaurant. Next year a television plant will start up. Next month a casino is due to open in Alma Ata--the only one between Moscow and Macao. Who knows, one day Kazakhstan's oil and cattle barons could twin Alma Ata with Las Vegas.
AUF WIEDERSEHEN, KAZAKHSTAN
Stalin was once described as Genghis Khan with a telephone. Now some of the millions whom Stalin ordered off to the steppes of Central Asia to work in his labour camps are returning home. Foremost are the 1m Volga Germans who are leaving Kazakhstan at a rate of 150,000 a year. But Greeks, Koreans, Tatars, Chechens and others are also busy packing their bags.
There are 2m ethnic Germans left in the former Soviet Union. Those who have tried to return to their farms on the Volga river, where they first settled 250 years ago, have been made unwelcome. The final insult came when Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, offered to resettle them on 8,000 redundant square kilometres of former missile-testing ground. On March 3rd Mr Yeltsin signed a decree supporting restoration of a German automomous republic on two parcels of land. Ukraine has offered to take some too. All the same, those who can are heading for Germany.
In Alma Ata the local Germans have their own newspapers, theatre and television programmes. But they fear that without their own state they will lose their cultural identity. The children of those deported by Stalin have often married non-Germans and speak Russian at home. Until the mid-1980s, when Mikhail Gorvachev came to power, schools were not allowed to teach in German, or other languages for that matter.
For the 150,000 Greeks, moved by Stalin from the Black Sea, the outlook is even less cheerful. They have no prospects of regaining their former homes. They do not speak Greek, as their mother tongue was Turkish. And even Russian may not be enough. A knowledge of Kazakh will sooner or later become a requirement for most jobs. While many non-Kazakhs are leaving, ethnic Kazakhs from Russia, Uzbekistan, China and Mongolia are trickling back. Of the several million Kazakhs abroad, 30,000 have already trekked from Mongolia. Some are buying up the houses which departing Germans are selling cheap."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224157619/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/27?accountid=14657,"Which party has the best policy for improving Britain's schools? Hardly the Tories, to judge from events of the past week or two. Listen to Labour and you hear sensible ideas about establishing an Educational Standards Commission to tighten up school inspection, and reforming A-levels (the examination for l8-year-olds) to encourage more pupils to go on to further education. Talk to the Liberal Democrats and you learn that they worry enough about education to press for 1p on income tax to pay for improvements.
Look at the Tories, though, and you see a party in trouble. An unpleasant row over a comprehensive school in East London is threatening to hole their flagship policy of encouraging every school to opt out of the control of whichever local educational authority (LEA) currently runs it. And a cunning ambush by opposition and independent peers in the House of Lords on March 2nd has knocked the stuffing out of their Education (Schools) bill, one of the last big bits of legislation before the election.
Thanks be to the Lords for their ambush. At the heart of the bill is a plan to privatise the school inspectorate; perhaps the silliest idea the Tories have come up with since Margaret Thatcher started spending more time with her family.
The privatisation plan is twofold: oblige schools to pay for their own inspection every four years or so; but allow them to choose between competing ""firms"" of inspectors. Some ""firms"" would consist of local-authority officials. Others would be made up of lay figures, notably businessmen and parents. A much slimmed-down version of Her Majesty's Inspectorate (HMI) would continue to monitor the system. But it still looks odd to make regulators clients of the schools they regulate.
Why did the government produce such a curious scheme? The current system certainly needs reforming. The HMI is too small to inspect all schools regularly and is too wedded to discredited waffle about good practice in the classroom. Local-authority inspectors are usually ineffectual because they are employed by the LEAS whose schools they are trying to evaluate. The most sensible solution would have been to beef up the HMI and give local inspectors more autonomy, which is more or less the solution favoured by the other two parties.
But the government is convinced that professional educationalists are responsible for sloppy standards in state schools. Entrench them in positions of influence as school inspectors, and they might continue to subvert the 1988 Education Act and perpetuate the errors of the 1960s. So Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, opted for privatisation.
This distrust of the education establishment also lies behind the Tories' other great embarrassment--the Stratford-school debacle. The Tories hoped that opting-out would shift the balance of power in schools away from educationalists (supposedly corrupted by trendy educational theories) to parent governors (supposedly instinctive guardians of traditional standards). But in Stratford School, a comprehensive which last year voted to opt out of LEA control and become self-governing, the scheme handed power to quite the wrong sorts of parent-governor--a clique more concerned with rabble rousing than with the three RS.
To them it seems scandalous that a school with a large majority of Asian pupils should have only a small minority of Asian teachers. The clique's leaders have pursued a vendetta against Anne Snelling, the school's popular and successful head; issued indiscriminate charges of racism and other sins; and demanded posts for themselves and their friends. At times the disruption has been so serious that the police have had to be summoned.
Mr Clarke has been forced to step in and clear up the mess. He has reinstated Mrs Snelling, who was briefly suspended by the governors, and imposed two new governors on the school, including Eric Bolton, a former head of--wait for it--the despised HMI. Mr Clarke is now thinking of restricting the power of all parent-governors.
All this leaves the idea of opting-out looking bedraggled. It was supposed to rescue education from the hands of political extremists; in Stratford, it has done just the opposite. Opting-out was also supposed to break the power of bureaucrats and hand decision-making to local parents; some parent-governors, though, are clearly less desirable than others.
It will take more than the House of Lords and one comprehensive school to keep a tough politician like Mr Clarke on the ropes. Many parents share his enthusiasm for old-fashioned teaching methods. He can claim that Tory ideas which everyone once dismissed as wild-eyed radicalism--like giving schools their own budgets--have now been stolen by both rival parties.
Above all, he can accuse the Labour Party of 1960s egalitarianism. Witness its intention to abolish grammar schools that produce some of the best examination results in the country; or to scrap City Technology Colleges that enhance the status of technical education; or to wind up the assisted-places scheme that enables bright working-class children to attend public schools.
Mr Clarke clearly has some emotive arguments on his side. But at the same time he runs the risk of seeing his policy scorned as a mishmash of ill-thought-out rules and radical wheezes. One thing is clear: he cannot afford another week like the past one if he is to turn schools into a vote winner."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224165318/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/28?accountid=14657,"In the heydey of Thatcherism, competition was the Tories' big gun in their battle against industrial decline. The troika of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) had a mission to seek out and destroy monopolies wherever they lurked.
Not so now. The high hopes that surrounded the appointment of a Thatcherite, Peter Lilley, as industry secretary in 1990 have evaporated. Mr Lilley is unlikely to keep the job in the next parliament and his most likely successors--Michael Heseltine or Gordon Brown--both prefer ""industrial strategy"" to competition. Ambitious plans to strengthen the OFT have come to nothing. And now there is a growing unease in many quarters about the performance of the MMC: has it gone soft?
The main worry concerns the MMC's monopoly-bashing role. A series of recent MMC reports, say critics, have shown too much respect for the views of the firms under investigation. In 1991 monopolies in photocopiers, instant coffee and soft drinks were all left largely intact. A report on the prices charged by BAA, an airports operator, sidestepped important questions about the future of duty-free sales and whether BAA should be broken up. And last month a report on the sale of motor cars that was widely expected to reshape the industry did no more than tinker with it. Contrast this with the heady days of the late 1980s, when the MMC helped to liberalise industrial-gas supply and aimed to weaken the control that brewers had over pubs.
Much of this criticism is harsh. Ever since an earlier industry secretary, Norman Tebbit, narrowed the definition of ""public interest"" to the effects of a monopoly or merger on competition, the MMC has at least taken a more consistent line on takeovers. And none of the recent reports has been easy; economists differed sharply over some of the questions that needed confronting. (Some disagreements have still not been satisfactorily resolved: the breakup of brewing, though based on well-argued economics, is now widely viewed as a disaster.) Perhaps complaints about the MMC simply come from aggrieved parties? Any worthwhile monopoly investigation, after all, is likely to leave behind disgruntled losers.
A FIRM LINE, NOT THE FIRMS' LINE
The car report suggests there is more to it than that. The investigation behind it, the longest and costliest ever done by the MMC, went to extraordinary lengths to give carmakers a chance to colour the arguments in their favour.
For instance, an independent report that showed huge differences in prices between cars sold in Britain and in continental Europe was sent out to manufacturers for ""consultation""; the numbers used in the final report showed a much smaller gap. And this gap was explained away by some shoddy economics. It was noted that cars sold in Britain tended to have extra ""addons"", for example, and that the price differential got smaller when these were taken into account; but these add-ons were valued at manufacturers' retail prices, not at what they actually cost. By contrast, the European Commission is expected soon to take a far tougher line towards the motor industry.
Of course, the car report maybe a one-off lapse. But the MMC's critics fear it may have taken too much to heart the government's fudge over the brewing industry. On that occasion, heavy lobbying by the industry prompted the then industry secretary, Lord Young, to back away from crucial proposals from the MMC. Did the commission see this as a signal from the government that radical solutions would no longer be welcome? (Much of the subsequent mess over brewing, incidentally, reflects the legacy of Lord Young's compromise, rather than the contents of the original MMC report.)
Another problem is the growing number of firms taking the MMC to court. Several recent cases have been subjected to judicial review; though the MMC has won most of them, the prospect of long legal battles may be instilling an undue caution.
The success of utility regulation may offer some clues as to how the MMC might be improved. Regulators like Oftel and Ofgas are independent of politicians, have clear duties and are supplemented by the role of the MMC as a ""court of appeal"". If the regulator and a utility cannot agree, the dispute can be referred to the MMC.
Contrast this with how other monopolies are regulated: the OFT asks the MMC to investigate, the MMC makes recommendations to the industry secretary, and the secretary does as he pleases. Why not bestow on the OFT a duty to promote competition, together with powers to investigate and to make rulings? A parallel reform could establish the MMC as an independent, quasijudicial body--rather than the collection of part-time businessmen and academics who currently make up the commission. Only if firms were unhappy with the OFT's decision would the MMC be involved; the industry secretary would play no part at all. Turning the MMC into a ""court of appeal"" in this way would also make it harder for companies to tie up the new-style OFT in lengthy and costly litigation.
The next government should also dust off and implement the 1989 white paper on restrictive trade practices, which was mysteriously buried soon after its publication. As the government was then ready to acknowledge, today's OFT is inflexible and slow, often busying itself with insignificant cases while failing to deal with serious anticompetitive agreements. The white paper made a powerful case for reform, which time has done nothing to dilute. Its recommendations were to strengthen the OFT's investigative powers, bring British rules into line with those of the European Commission and allow offending firms to be fined up to L1m ($1.7m). Whose election manifesto will take up the cause?"

This year the Treasury has had help from an unexpected quarter. Greenpeace, an environmental lobbying group better known for creating photocalls than fiscal opportunities, met Rachel Lomax, the Treasury's deputy chief economic adviser, and officials from a number of other departments with a set of budget representations.
Greenpeace was pleasantly surprised by Mrs Lomax's command of green issues and by her apparent interest in matters environmental. No doubt Mrs Lomax was delighted to meet a deputation with many more ideas for increasing taxes than lowering them. A pleasant change for the Treasury.
Greenpeace came up with its own suggestions for tightening the tax treatment of company cars: tax the full user benefit, on the assumption that most drivers do little or no business mileage, and then give an allowance for actual business mileage undertaken. That, it argued, would be fairer to genuine business users, while penalising everybody else. Greenpeace also proposed taxing free parking as a benefit in kind, a practice discontinued in 1988; half the cars entering central London at rush hour are company cars, it points out, and failure to tax non-residental off-street car parking in central London costs L38m ($70m) a year in lost tax revenue and national-insurance contributions.
A more probable change in vehicle taxation, however, is a reduction in the special car tax and its replacement by a higher petrol tax. The motor industry, desperate to revive sales, likes the idea. It might appeal to the Deparment of the Environment, which is worried that the gradual improvement in energy efficiency over the years will stop during the recession because people are no longer making new, more energy-efficient investments. Other EC countries are considering car taxes graded by fuel efficiency; Britain might do the same.
The EC has also been trying to agree on an energy tax, levied partly on the carbondioxide content of fuels (to reflect their impact on global warming) and partly on energy itself (to prevent the tax from favouring the French, with their large nuclear industry). Such a tax, Greenpeace and Mrs Lomax happily agreed, would raise lots of revenue. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates in its own ""green"" (ie, prototype) budget that a tax of $10 per barrel of oil equivalent would raise L5 billion-10 billion a year. But it would also fall most heavily on coal, which emits twice as much carbon dioxide per unit of energy generated as does gas; and both political parties have reasons for not wanting to increase the price of coal.
A likelier bet is therefore the removal of value-added tax on investments in energy efficiency. At present Britain (alone in the EC) exempts domestic energy from VAT. It is therefore, as the companies that sell double glazing and home insulation never cease to point out, anomalous to charge VAT on their products. The government might also remove VAT on the building work involved in home-insulation. If it does, it might be wise to make exemption conditional on a certificate showing a home's energy rating."

Olympia was housing the London Show, giving dozens of young fashion designers an opportunity to show just how much work has to go into dressing casually these days.
Buyers from 42 countries filed into the exhibition hall to gawp, and sometimes even buy, their way through racks of PVC mini-skirts, lame jackets and silver-coloured 14-hole ""Doc Marten"" boots. Designers lounged around on all sides, often dressed to match the black rubber sofas they were lying on; here and there the odd smartly dressed Japanese buyer would be wandering in search of that special rubber wedding dress that would be sure to turn shoppers' heads in a Tokyo department store.
""Street Fashion""--ie, trendy but cheap attire for young urbanites--is a niche market which London has kept hold of since the mini-skirted Mary Quant cornered it in the 1960s. Britain's haute-couture designers may be struggling to hold their own against competitors in Paris, Milan and New York; but on the ""wild and wacky"" clothes rails, London still rules. Organisers of Kensinton's seven-year-old trade fair claim there is nothing like it anywhere.
For foreign boutique owners, a ""Made in England"" label matters less than a ""worn in England"" guarantee. British ""style"" magazines are read avidly by hipsters from Ottawa to Osaka, all determined to keep up with trend-setting Londoners. They know precisely what bright young Brixton or Camden is going clubbing in; peer pressure does the rest.
Clothing these fashion-victims is a multi-million-pound business. Just how multi is difficult to tell. But the London Show's organisers reckon its 150 or so participants may have notched up sales of at least L100m (roughly $175m) during the week. The street-fashion trade probably accounts for a quarter or more of Britain's L2 billion export business in clothes.
Hard times hit the weirdo merchants less savagely than traders in other parts of the rag trade. Most of their followers are too young to worry about the mortgage. They have to spend most of their money on clothes, just to stay respectable on the street. Loco, the maker of the rubber wedding dress, did a roaring trade at Kensington this year in studded dresses and slit-shoulder bolero jackets, particularly with French buyers. Mark Shepherd, a Loco designer, attributes London's guru status to young Londoners' ""innate tendency to be eccentric"".
Red Or Dead, a company famous for making big clompy boots, took over L400,000 in wholesale orders in the three days of the show. Wayne Hemingway, the company's co-owner, says that London is recovering from a couple of years when it was considered ""a bit silly"". The company has notched up a turnover of nearly L8m ($13.8m) in the past 12 months, and has franchisees in Birmingham, Copenhagen and Amsterdam.
Mr Hemingway is thinking bigger still, but his expansion plans need the collaboration of the big British chain stores. For their part, though, stores like Marks & Spencer are nothing like as adventurous with clothes as they are with food. If, like their counterparts abroad, the stores had the courage to stock his creations, Mr Heminway could spend less time worrying about the business side and more time being creative. But then, most Britons always were such boring dressers."

They talk as if their policies will benefit every southern hamlet and northern suburb equally. Yet the Tories and Labour are far from being all-Britain parties. Indeed, they are not far from being regional alliances.
This regionalism has little to do with left-right differences of doctrine. Labour, the party of northern England, Scotland and Wales, tends to advocate things which it believes will benefit its territory. Ditto the Conservatives, holding the south. If, instead of calling themselves socialists and free-market men, they described themselves as the North-Celt Alliance and the Southern Front, only the rhetoric of their manifestos would need altering, not the substance.
The most obvious example is constitutional change. The North-Celt Alliance favours a Scottish parliament and a Welsh assembly. So important are these that the Labour (or North-Celt) leader, Neil Kinnock, has promised to legislate on Scotland within his first year of gaining office. Labour politicians like Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader and a self-styled archetypal northerner, promises that regional development agencies for the north will also be a priority.
Arguably none of these things would help the areas they are designed to help, but that is not the point; Scots and northerners think they would. Douglas Henderson, the party's industry spokesman, says there is virtually no difference between Labour's policy on manufacturing and the private views of industrialists in the English northeast. There, as in Celtic Britain, Labour is the establishment.
Labour's tax policy will hit disproportionately hard in the high-earning London suburbs and the home counties--held by its enemy, the Southern Front. Its European policy stresses the need for ""greatly enlarged regional and structural funds"". Both at European and national levels, it would celebrate victory by taxing the newly occupied territory in the south, and would send the spoils north and west. Its transport policy is to ensure good channel-tunnel links, heading north.
The Conservatives, or Southern Front, helped create a long boom in the south by liberalising financial markets; pouring subsidies into home-ownership; and cutting taxes for the better-off, who are clustered in the south. Their readiness to squeeze inefficient or outdated manufacturers out of business hurt most in the old industrial areas of the north, Scotland and Wales. The privatisation of the electricity industry is wiping out another northern employer, the coal industry. Have all manufacturers done badly? No: many new businesses have prospered under the Tories--but none more so than those gathered in areas like the M4 corridor adjoining southern motorways. The deregulation of the labour market, though, probably did more for the service industries than for manufacturing
Now the Southern Front wants to ensure the benefits of its regional boom are passed on, by cutting inheritance taxes (not much of an issue in Bolton). The right wants to go further and abolish the higher rate of income tax altogether.
The Southern Front's social policies also appear to trigger a particularly enthusiastic response in its regional base. Of the 204 English secondary schools that have used their new right to opt out of local-authority control, most are in the south and shire counties--48 of them in Kent and Lincolnshire alone. A similar pattern can be seen when it comes to self-managed hospital trusts and local doctors' practices which now run their own budgets. By contrast, the crackdown on social-security payments for items like beds and furniture for the poorest families (so tough that ministers themselves have had to respond this week with an extra L75m ($131m) hits hardest in the north.
Yes, this analysis is rough and incomplete. The Southern Front has recently been presiding over a recession that has bitten deepest in the heavily borrowed south-east, to the extent of blurring the traditional north-south divide. Its environment secretary, Michael Heseltine, is working hard to revive the northern cities. Its health policy is pushing money out of London and into hospitals in (among other places) the north of England.
Similarly, the North-Celt Alliance needs to win seats in and around London, and has been advertising policies on congestion and housing that it thinks will appeal to southern voters. It promises a new central authority for London, as well as a parliament for Edinburgh.
Both parties rely for their hopes of power on winning seats well beyond their heartland areas. If the Tories became merely the Southern Front, or Labour just the North-Celt Alliance, neither party would be able to hold power. And emotionally, as well as politically, Labour and Conservative politicians resent the idea that they are mere regional warlords. The Liberal Democrats can claim to have a national reach--but mainly because they suffer from the awkwardness of holding seats in the North-Celt areas (and so being pro-Home Rule, etc) yet seeing their best hopes in the south.
Neverteless, the caricatures are useful: the regional bunching of seats is undeniable and it is hard to rebut the notion that this affects how the parties think. Tory MPS roam through constituencies where the local grammar school has opted out of local-authority control; where many doctors run their own budgets; where the prospect of higher taxes on incomes above L30,000 raises a real tremor of apprehension. They go home and write their election addresses, reflecting confidently on a different world from that seen by typical Labour MPS.
The policy which benefits all parts of a diverse country equally and at the same time is rare indeed; but the lack of a more genuinely nationwide perspective inside the big parties has damaged the political debate. It has meant a Toly government that fails to understand some of the problems of the north, and the aspirations of the Scots. It has meant a Labour opposition that has been foolishly sneering about service-industry jobs and that has tried to defend the old economic order for too long. What would cure this? A proportional voting system that boosted the number of Labour MPS in the south and Conservative strength in the north. Sadly but predictably, both parties still balk at that medicine."

With their windows taped up and engines covered, aircraft can be preserved for years in a dry climate. Now Mr Sabovich is caring for more than 160 airliners of every shape and size. They include 40 Boeing 727s that belonged to bankrupt Eastern Air Lines and some British Airways TriStars. Also there is a brace of shiny new Boeing 747s belonging to Air Canada which cost $140m each and flew to the airport straight from the factory in Seattle.
More than 1,000 aircraft--about 10% of the world's entire commercial aircraft fleet-are now idle. Many are parked in deserts like Mojave or at the edges of civilian airports. The newest jets, like Air Canada's 747s, will be the first back into service when air travel picks up again. But many of the parked aircraft are more than 20 years old, and their final flight could be to the breaker's yard. At least, that is what aircraft manufacturers hope. Last year orders for new jets fell to $32 billion. They had soared to a record $90 billion in 1989, before the combined effects of the Gulf war and an economic slowdown knocked the airlines sideways, scaring them away from ordering new aircraft (see chart on next page).(Chart omitted.)
In 1990 the world's airlines lost a combined $2.7 billion on their scheduled international services alone, not counting millions more lost on many domestic routes. Last year the loss on international routes was closer to $4 billion. For the first time since 1945, air travel actually declined worldwide. ""The best thin you can say about last year is that it's over,"" says Robert Crandall, the boss of American Airlines. His airline, one of the world's biggest and strongest, has decided to cancel or delay the purchase of about $5 billion-worth of new aircraft over the next five years. Its rival, United Airlines, has also cut its plans for spending on new aircraft by about $6 billion.
The aircraft makers are putting on a brave face. America's Boeing, the biggest supplier, which usually accounts for about half the market, is cutting production of its 737, the world's best-selling jet, from 21 aircraft a month to 14. But, like Europe's Airbus Industry and California's McDonnell Douglas, its two biggest competitors, Boeing is soldiering on without changing its production plans for any other models.
Indeed, ambitions still abound. Both Boeing and Airbus are discussing with airlines the possibility of making a gigantic aircraft, with 600-800 seats. Both are also trying to lure Japanese aerospace companies to join them in these multi-billion-dollar projects. In addition, McDonnell Douglas is talking to Asian companies about taking a stake in its commercial-aircraft business and jointly developing an aircraft to rival Boeings 747. McDonnell Douglas has been hoping to sell a 40% stake for $2 billion to Taiwan Aerospace, a consortium partly financed by the government. But the talks have dragged on amid concern that the Taiwanese may be interested in only a 25% shareholding.
Makers of smaller aircraft are equally ambitious. Holland's Fokker is considering launching a smaller version of its successful 100-seat jet. Although Deutsche Aerospace builds fuselages for the Dutch company, it has also been planning to team up with France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia to build a competing aircraft.
Despite the ranks of idle aircraft filling desert airfields, aircraft makers insist that lots more aircraft will be needed in the future. On March 3rd Boeing published its long-term market forecast, which predicts that airlines will take delivery of nearly 6,000 new jets (of all makes) between now and 2000. In all, these should be worth some $380 billion at today's prices. In the decade after that, says Boeing, airlines will spend another $500 billion on new aircraft. Most of Boeing's rivals are just as bullish.
Such rosy forecasts assume that world air travel will grow by 5X a year for the next 20 years. The present slump, claims Boeing, is little more than a blip. Steady growth at this rate would more than double the size of the air-travel market by 2005.
This may not be as optimistic as it sounds. Air travel grew by 7% a year between 1970 and 1990. Even if limits on airport capacity restrain growth in America or Europe, new markets such as Asia, which Boeing expects to grow by 9% a year from now until 2010, could pull up the world average.
Yet recovery may be patchy. Many once high-spending business travelers have switched to cheaper seats in the back of the aircraft or chosen to use the fax machine instead of flying. It may take a long time to win such customers back. With telecommunications becoming cheaper and more high-tech, the number of business travelers may decline permanently. A big European car maker found that its staff reduced their travel by 30o when it restricted all company air travel to economy class.
Even if passenger volumes grow as rapidly as the aircraft makers predict, it is unclear on present trends who will provide the gigantic sums of money that airlines will need to buy all the aeroplanes the aircraft makers hope to sell them. One reason for the binge of orders in the 1980s was the widespread fear among airlines that new jets would be in short supply for years to come. Lots of financial institutions piled into the market, especially Japanese investors encouraged by tax breaks. But now there is a lot of aircraft. The willingness of Japanese institutions to put their money into anything with wings--or rotor blades for that matter (see box)--has evaporated with the fall in Japanese share and property values. (Box omitted.)
Boeing says there will have to be changes in the way aircraft purchases are financed. It reckons there will be a switch away from banks to international capital markets to raise the money (see table) and that more innovative financing will be developed. Compared with other industries, such as property, airlines have been slow to employ the plethora of financing techniques designed by clever brokers and investment bankers.
Smith New Court, a London stockbroker, has broken down the problem of financing $480 billion-worth of new aircraft over ten years. It says airlines could probably raise about $150 billion out of their own cash flow, or by issuing new equity and borrowing. A further $100 billion could be supplied by leasing companies, like Ireland's GAP-which is considering a stockmarket flotation later this year to raise new equity of its own-and its Californian rival ILFC, which is owned by American International Group, a big insurance group. Leasing companies buy jets at a bulk discount and then rent them on so-called ""operating"" leases to airlines over a fixed term.
That leaves a shortfall of more than $200 billion. Smith New Court says this amount is too large to be covered by so-called ""finance"" leases, i.e., mortgages on aircraft from banks or investors. Both Smith New Court and GAP reckon the resulting gap can be filled by so-called ""securitisation"", the sale to investors of shares in individual aircraft, just as shares are sold in big commercial-property projects. GAP has already sold some of its aircraft to investors this way and then continued to manage the aircraft for the new owners.
How attractive shares in individual aircraft will be to fund managers remains to be seen. Unlike property, aircraft do at least have the advantage of being mobile-so they can be flown to any part of the world in search of a customer. But, unlike property, they are also a wasting asset. If aircraft makers are right, many of the jets now parked in the desert will be scrapped. Investors will take note of that."

CHOPPERS ON THE BLOCK
What may have been the world's biggest auction of helicopters was held on March 5th in Tokyo. No fewer than 40 machines were up for sale, one out of every 12 civilian helicopters in Japan. Except for a test flight or two, many had never been used by their sellers. The auction is another sign that Japan's late-1980s flirtation with flagrantly conspicuous consumption is, at least for now, out of fashion.
Like golf-course memberships and Impressionist paintings, helicopters became status symbols for Japan's newly super-rich. The number of registered private helicopters has risen by two-thirds in the past four years, to 480. Many were bought by property speculators, owners of game arcades and suchlike.
Helicopters have also played a minor role in Japan's spate of scandals. Sagawa Kyubin, Japan's second-largest parcel-delivery firm, is said to have bribed hundreds of politicians. In 1990, according to the police, it also lent Y800m ($5.5m) to Tensho Sangyo, a property company controlled by a gangster, Susumu Ishii, to buy a Sikorsky helicopter which he then fitted out luxuriously. Ishii, who died last year, was the head of Japan's second-largest crime syndicate and was at the centre of last summer's stockmarket scandals.
The helicopter slump is bad news for Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which last year had a 49% share of the domestic market. Also disappointed is France's Aerospatiale, which had 27%. Two American producers, Bell and Sikorksy, lagged behind with shares of 8% and 7% respectively. Even at its peak, the helicopter fad did little to lower Japan's irritating trade surplus with America."

His advice: companies need to devote more office space to creating places like well-tended living rooms, where employees can sit around in comfort and chat.
Mr Becker is one of a group of academics and consultants trying to make companies more productive by linking new office technology to a better understanding of how employees work. The forecasts of a decade ago--that computers would increase office productivity, reduce white-collar payrolls and help the remaining staff to work better--have proved much too hopeful. Mr Becker, who unfortunately calls himself an ""organisational ecologist"", is trying to find out why the huge sums of money spent on office automation have produced such disappointing results. He is leading a two-year study on offices called ""Workscape 21"". Sponsored by Cornell, the study is financed by firms in America, Japan, Britain and Holland.
Even before completing the study, Mr Becker has firm ideas about how the office of the future should look. Technology, better communications, rising inner-city land costs (once today's property bust is over) and the trials of commuting will, he predicts, prompt more workers to split time between a central office, a computer-equipped home office and perhaps a satellite office in a suburban business park.
Even those few workers based at the central office will be more mobile, moving between different work stations as their tasks change, taking their mobile telephones with them. This will cut the amount of wasted office space, says Mr Becker. It will also improve communications among employees, by pushing them out of the tight and unchanging circle of people who sit nearby.
Mr Becker predicts that the central office will become mainly a place where workers from satellite and home-based offices meet to discuss ideas and to reaffirm their loyalty to fellow employees and the company. This will require new thoughts about the lay out of office buildings. Now, spaces for copying machines, coffee rooms, meetings and reception areas usually come second to the offices in which people spend most of the day working. Mr Becker sees these common areas gradually becoming the heart of an office. He even believes that many central offices will come to resemble a hotel lobby or somebody's home--a disturbing thought, that, for people who find in the calm of the office a refuge from the rigours of family life.
Managers, says Mr Becker, will also have to abandon their long-cherished notion that a productive employee is an employee that can be seen. Appearing on time and looking busy will soon become irrelevant. Technology and new patterns of office use will make companies judge people by what they do, not by where they spend their time.
That does not mean the end of the office, just its transformation into a social centre. Thomas Allen, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has studied communication patterns between people, in the admittedly artificial environment of research laboratories. His less-than-startling conclusion is that people talk to each other more when they work in close proximity. Workers on different floors might as well be in different buildings, so rarely do they see one another. Because buildings are seldom designed with employee-to-employee contact in mind, co-workers may barely know someone a few yards away, even though they have related jobs.
To show how this can be changed, Mr Allen has helped one pharmaceutical firm to establish an experimental office designed to get chemists and biologists to talk more to each other. A similar bunch of employees, serving as a control group, is occupying a more conventional building. The two groups will be compared far such things as the time they take to complete reports and the rate at which they find new chemical compounds.
New ideas about offices are catching on elsewhere. By 1993 IBM's British division will have all 1,000 of its headquarters employees working in ""non-territorial"" offices--places where they have no desk to call their own. And in California TRW and GTE are trying to help employees cope with traffic problems and work more efficiently by setting up satellite offices. Digital Equipment Corp's subsidiary in Finland has equipped offices with reclining chairs and stuffed sofas to make them more comfortable and conducive to informal conversations and the swapping of ideas. Companies such as Apple and General Electric are experimenting along similar lines.
Steelcase, a manufacturer of office furniture, is one of the firms keenest to experiment with new office lay outs and designs. The company's research centre in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is a $111m building completed in 1989. It is designed around a series of office ""neighbourhoods"" that put marketing, manufacturing and design people close to each other so that they can find it easier to discuss ideas and solve problems. Employees on different floors can see one another through glass, and easily go from floor to floor via escalators.
Top managers work in a cluster of offices that are wrapped around an atrium in the middle of the building, rather than occupying the usual suite of top-floor offices. They can see, and be seen by, the people they manage. Mr Allen, who worked as a consultant to Steelcase and argued vigorously for placing the bosses' offices in the middle of the building, believes it will improve managers' chances of bumping into the people they lead. ""Who knows,"" he says, ""they might even talk to them.""
Enriching as it is to be constantly under the gaze of your superiors, Steelcase employees are also rather keen on 14 ""think-tanks"" located on the sixth floor of the pyramid. Intended for intense, individual work, these small offices are equipped with a computer, but no telephone. Available on a first-come, first-served basis, these havens are rarely unoccupied. Sometimes even the most communicative employee just wants to be left alone."

They will be miserable. Like most other big ad agencies, Saatchi & Saatchi was battered in its two main markets, America and Britain, by the worst downturn in spending on advertising in two decades. Unlike most of its competitors, the company had to take costly steps last year to avoid going bust. It all adds up to numbers scrawled in red.
Richard Dale, an analyst at Smith New Court, reckons that, before exceptional items, Saatchi & Saatchi has lost around L9m ($16m), on revenues of L720m. After exceptionals (including the cost of restructuring AC&R, an American agency that is part of the Saatchi network, and redundancy costs) the loss could be L40m-50m.
That may be bad, but a year ago it was far from clear that Saatchi & Saatchi would even survive. Then, after two disastrous years of losses brought on by a decade of errant empire-building by the company's founders, brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi, a recapitalisation was needed to save it from ruin. Bondholders were awarded shares-and ordinary shareholders swallowed hard as their ownership was diluted from 100% to 16%.
Painful though it was, the recapitalisation put Saatchi & Saatchi on relatively firm financial ground. Net debt has steadied at around L200m, well within the agreed facilities of L324m. Costs have been cut mercilessly by the company's chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus. Since his arrival in 1990 the payroll has shrunk from more than 18,000 to 13,000. Even conservative estimates of cash-flow suggest the company will have no trouble staying within its banking covenants. Contrast that with WPP, Saatchi's equally troubled rival, which despite somewhat better results (also to be announced soon) has been struggling to soothe its worried bankers.
So Saatchi & Saatchi will survive. But will it prosper? And in what form? Mr Louis-Dreyfus says this year will tell. If the company is not making respectable profits by 1993, his draconian measures will have been a failure. Smith New Court's Mr Dale reckons Saatchi should make a pre-tax profit this year of around L17m. That assumes a modest upturn in advertising spending in America and Europe--which is far from certain. Still, Saatchi--owned agencies have won about $260m-worth of new business since January. And Zenith, the company's specialist media-buying firm, is thriving.
Now Mr Louis-Dreyfus is talking of forming a third international ad-agency network alongside the group's two main ones, Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide (SSAW) and Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide (BSBW). Its lead agencies would be Minneapolis-based Campbell-Mithun-Esty (CME) and London-based KHBB. At first CME and KHBB will simply offer overseas service to each other's clients. Later, if there is demand, start-up agencies in Europe may be added to complete a proper network. This may seem peculiar, but could make sense for two reasons.
First, CME's clients may want to do business in Europe, but be reluctant to deal with Saatchi's existing agencies there. In a business so driven by individual personalities and peculiar loyalties this is all too plausible.
Second, creating yet a third network could suit Mr Louis-Dreyfus, offering him a chance to replace the crumbling BSBW, which last year went on one of the industry's most dreadful losing streaks. Longtime American clients such as Miller Lite, a beer brand, Dole, a tinned-fruit company, and Xerox all fled in rapid succession, prompting a management reshuffle. Mr Louis-Dreyfus has given the new team until the end of this year to turn BSBW round. Already the agency has won several big accounts, including $90m in cigarette-advertising billings from B.A.T. Industries.
Yet the suspicion remains that Mr Louis-Dreyfus wants to do something about BSBW. Friends say he thinks of it as Saatchi's ""problem child""; his dislike of one of its founders, Carl Spielvogel, is legendary. Mr Louis-Dreyrus might already have sold the agency had someone offered a decent price. At the same time he praises CME lavishly for its home-grown culture and commonsense management. By merging BSBW into the new CME-KHBB network, he could combine the strengths of each while losing the stigma attached to the BSBW name, and cut Saatchi's costs even further.
Such a move would also give Mr Louis-Dreyfus a bit of the business to call his own. For two years he has been cleaning up the mess created by the Saatchi brothers. Recently he sacked Richard Humphreys, head of SSAW and a potential rival. Days later a story in London's Sunday Times reported that Mr Louis-Dreyfus was unhappy with Charles Saatchi, whose mysterious role (and impressive salary) as creative guru has irked many shareholders. Mr Louis-Dreyfus denied the story, calling Charles a ""vitally important asset"". But who runs Saatchi & Saatchi remains unclear. Perhaps it will not stay that way for much longer."

Most big chemical firms, like Britain's ICI and Germany's Hoechst, saw their future in more recession-proof businesses, especially drugs. Many poured extra money into their existing drug subsidiaries. But wary of the cost and risk of a big acquisition, few chemical firms were prepared to leap into the business with a takeover. The two exceptions were America's Dow and Rhone-Poulenc. So far the move looks successful for both firms-but Rhone-Poulenc's acquisition is off to an especially good start. Were other chemical companies too cautious, or has Rhone-Poulenc simply been lucky? Perhaps a bit of both.
In July 1990 Rhone-Poulenc paid $2 billion for a controlling stake in Rorer, an American drug maker, and promptly merged its own, smaller drug business with the American company. Rhone-Poulenc reaped an immediate reward. In 1991 operating profits in its health division (which includes Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and a 50.5% stake in Institut Merieux, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer) jumped 110%, to FFr4.2 billion ($744m). Health now accounts for 35% of Rhone-Poulenc's FFr83.8 billion sales. The firm reported an increase in operating profits of 37.5% to FFr6.3 billion last year, while the recession depressed profits at most other chemicals companies.
When he arrived at Rhone-Poulenc, Mr Fortou already knew a lot about the drug industry. As head of Bossard, a management-consulting firm, he had made it his speciality. He quickly concluded that Rhone-Poulenc's drug business, though growing, suffered from two defects. It sold too many different products, and most of its sales were in France. As Mr Fortou saw it, the company either had to get big enough to diversify beyond France and support its array of products, or withdraw from the industry altogether. What is more, it had to make a decision quickly. Independent drug firms were in the midst of a merger binge, creating ever bigger rivals.
The fact that Rorer was also looking for a partner, admits Mr Fortou, was a stroke of luck. Rhone-Poulenc knew the company and its managers well because of earlier licensing arrangements. Most of Rorer's business was in America, where Rhone-Poulenc wanted to expand; little was in Europe, where the French firm already had a market presence. Better still, Rorer itself was looking for a merger partner. It had doubled its size by buying the health-care operations of Revlon, a cosmetics firm, in 1986. It then spent two frustrating years searching for another acquisition. By 1989 Bob Cawthorne, Rorer's boss, was willing to surrender his company's independence to the right buyer.
Despite the friendliness of the deal, Rhone-Poulenc paid a hefty 35-times earnings for its controlling stake in Rorer. To finance this, Mr Fortou had to borrow $1.5 billion, pushing Rhone-Poulenc's debts to 92% of shareholders' equity. Mr Fortou concedes that such a gamble was possible because the French government owns 56% of his company's shares directly and another 16% through state-owned banks.
Nevertheless, Rhone-Poulenc's private shareholders (whose shares were trading at only eight times earnings) and its bankers were nervous enough to demand a justification for the deal. This obliged both firms to work out a complete merger plan in advance. They went so far as to say who would get most of the top jobs in the merged company--rare even in friendly deals. Maybe it should be more common. It helped to ensure the merger's success, says Mr Fortou.
At the same time, Mr Fortou decentralised Rhone-Poulenc's decision-making so its small executive board could concentrate on strategy. The fact that Rhone-Poulenc owns just two-thirds of the merged drug firm has also helped, he says: the arms-length relationship between the chemical and drug businesses, and the drug company's separate quotation on the New York Stock Exchange, have made the new firm's managers more accountable.
With a much bigger sales force now spanning America and Europe, the drugs of both Rorer and Rhone-Poulenc can now be promoted to millions more customers. For example, sales of Maalox, Rorer's over-the-counter treatment for upset stomachs, rose 25% in 1991 to $300m. In 1990, before the merger, Rorer on its own had managed to increase Maalox sales by just 5%. Mr Fortou predicts that drug profits should continue to rise annually by about 20% for the next few years, growth on a par with top drug firms. After that, he hopes, drugs discovered in the merged firm's research laboratories will produce even taster growth."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224162077/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/37?accountid=14657,"MLADA BOLESLAV
Before Czechoslovakia's ""velvet revolution overthrew the communist regime and opened the country's economy in 1989, many Czech motorists preferred to drive a Russian Lada than to travel in a home-made Skoda. Skodas were less outdated and built at what was probably the best equipped car factory in Eastern Europe, but the old-fashioned Lada was rugged and simple enough to repair at home.
Now everything has changed, and Skoda is owned by Germany's Volkswagen. Yet the Czechs are still hardly rushing to buy.
VW agreed to buy 31% of Skoda in December 1990. As a result of its deal with the Prague government, the German firm already has management control; it plans to increase its shareholding to 70% by 1994. So far VW has invested DM620m ($390m) in the company. By the end of the century it aims to increase its total investment to more than DM9 billion.
VW hopes to marry German efficiency and quality-control with Czechoslovakia's low costs. The result is supposed to be a competitively priced small car that can be sold in Western and Central Europe. VW says it will keep the Skoda name and plans to double output to 400,000 cars a year by the late 1990s. New models will also be introduced. There may even be a Skoda limousine and a sports-utility vehicle.
But VW has far to go to meet such ambitious targets. Since the German firm arrived in Mlada Boleslav, the town in Bohemia where Skoda is based, sales of Skodas in Czechoslovakia have dived by 25%. Output fell by 20,000 cars last year, to 170,000, and many of the workers who survived the first wave of redundancies have had to work short-time. Some are unhappy with their new German masters.
The collapse in the domestic market coincides with the new availablity of better western imports, especially second-hand cars. At first the imports benefited from a topsy-turvy system of tariffs. Skodas carried a 43% tax; imported cars were more expensive, but were taxed at only 9%. After much lobbying of the Prague government, Volkswagen (the country's biggest foreign investor) got things changed. Skodas now carry a 25% tax; taxes on imported cars have gone up to 34%. Skoda also exports cars, but in some of its main overseas markets it has found the going tough.
Despite all that, Volkhard Kohler, VW's top manager in Czechoslovakia, still takes a bullish view. In deference to local sensibilities, he is nominally only vice-chairman of the Skoda board (which is headed by a Czech). But few doubt where the real power lies. Together with 40 other Germans (soon to be 140), Mr Kohler has the immediate task of improving the company's one and only model, the Skoda Favorit, with stricter quality control in the factory. At the equivalent of about $5,000, the Favorit may look like a bargain. But it would take a decade for most Czech workers to save that much, concedes Mr Kohler.
Better quality and low price are essential to Skoda's success, not only in its home market but elsewhere in Europe. Carl Hahn, Volkswagen's chairman, has even bigger ambitions. He has suggested that Skoda cars may eventually be introduced to the American market, too.
Because German labour costs are rising, a car plant in a low-wage country makes sense for volkswagen. But the company already owns another producer of small, cheap cars: it bought SEAT from the Spanish government in 1986. Can Volkswagen stop SEAT and Skoda stealing each other's customers? Mr Kohler plans a mixed approach: some pooling of resources (in the development of new engine technology, for instance) and some co-operation in distribution. Skoda, he insists, will remain independent. That soothes Czech worries about a German takeover, but is it the way for VW to sell more Skodas or make a profit?"

If the best measure of a good compromise is how much it upsets all the parties concerned, the European Commission's plan to liberalise postal services is a winner. Many managers in the European Community's state-owned post offices see it as a death warrant. Bertie Coxall, a lobbyist for courier firms which stand to benefit from deregulation, complains it is just the opposite: a ""charter"" which would underpin Europe's existing postal monopolies at the expense of commercial rivals.
Both groups protest too much. In a still-unpublished consultative green paper, the commission calls for more competition in the EC's mail services, which are worth 46 billion ecus ($58 billion) a year. But competition would not be allowed to threaten the existence of public monopolies for the delivery of letters.
The commission has been so upset by the barrage of criticism aroused by the green paper that it has postponed its publication several times. It will now probably wait until after France's regional elections this month and Britain's general election (probably next month) to publish it. Once the proposals are issued, member governments will have to decide which bits to endorse.
The thrust of the paper, however, is:
* All mail services in EC countries would be open to private-sector competition--except the delivery of letters and postcards. These would be reserved for government post offices. In return they would have to guarantee a ""universal"" service to all destinations. The distribution of parcels and printed matter would be opened to competition.
* Competition would also be allowed in international postal services and cross-border services between Community members.
* To justify their continued monopoly on cards and letters, postal administrations would have to meet explicit quality and performance standards.
The green paper leaves some grey areas. It does not define what the maximum limits for letters and cards included in the universal service should be. These vary in EC countries. In Britain the Post Office has a monopoly defined by price: letters and cards delivered for less than L1 ($1.75). In Holland the upper limit is set by weight: 500 gammes. In other countries, the monopoly extends to letters up to one kilo (Germany and Denmark) or two (the rest).
Predictably, private couriers want this monopoly to be as limited as possible. The commission is non-committal, except to say that limit should perhaps be even lower than those now applied by Britain and Holland. At present the private couriers control about 43% of the total 46 billion-ecu market (ie, letters, parcels and express packages), but only 2% of revenues from letter delivery. Not all couriers will want to fight the national post offices for cross-border or national letter mail, however. The industry consists of many small local and regional firms. The four big international carrier--UPS, Federal Express, TNT and DHL--account for only about 15% of the total market. They are the keenest monopoly busters.
The postal green paper is modelled on a similar consultative document on telecoms issued by the commission in 1987, which began the deregulation of that industry. It was also based on the notion of reserved services (voice telephony and telex) with competition for so-called value-added services.
After the green paper had been drafted by oflicials, Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, insisted that the delivery of international mail should be opened up to competition as well. That change has been one of the most upsetting for the national postal monopolies, who fear that it is likely to undermine the economics of their letter-delivery services. They are now bombarding the commission with letters of complaint--sent by monopoly mail, of course."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136560/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/39?accountid=14657,"At a meeting of the American Chemical Society in 1930, Thomas Midgeley, a chemist on the research staff of General Motors, demonstrated the safety of his newly discovered refrigerant by inhaling a lungful and using it to blow out a candle. Related compounds of the gas turned out to have other uses: as a foam-blower, a cleaning solvent and an aerosol propellant. Phasing out the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCS) therefore deprives the world of an exceptionally useful product.
The confirmation earlier this year of ozone depletion over the northern hemisphere led the United States last month to bring forward from 2000 to 1995 the date by which CFC production must be stopped. The EC aims to follow. A meeting next month of the signatories of the Montreal Protocol on ozone depletion is likely to propose that developed countries phase out CFC production by 1995-97.
Since 1986 (see chart) world production has declined by an impressive 40%. From now on, though, the costs of cutting back will rise. (Chart omitted) Users must choose between recycling the existing stock of CFCS, or switching to substitute chemicals. The more existing equipment has to be scrapped before the end of its life or retro-fitted to use substitutes, the higher the cost to users.
In Europe there has been little recycling so far. Mike Harris, regulatory manager for ICI's fluorocarbon business, says that his company had hoped to recover 5% of the CFCS and halons it sells but has so far retrieved less than 1%. In America progress has also been sluggish, although the 1990 Clean Air Act requires the recovery of CFCS from cars from the beginning of this year and from stationary sources from July. The Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, which represents America's producers and users, wants the government to allow large users to store CFCS so that they could be used again in the air-conditioning systems of large buildings, rather than replacing them with equipment that can use substitutes.
One reason for slow progress on recycling may be that, despite cuts in CFC output, the price of the chemicals has not risen, making it unattractive to recycle them. The United Statets has imposed a tax on CFCS that increases annually; it is currently $1.67 a pound. This has helped to offset a collapse in the pre-tax price of CFCS to around 60-90 cents a pound, which is no more in real terms than ten years ago. American producers complain that foreign companies are dumping cheap CFCS. Only since America announced its earlier phase-out of production last month has the price at last begun to rise.
The main substitutes for CFCSs are being developed by some of the 19 companies that now make the stuff. Tony Vogelsberg, environmental manager at Du Pont, the world's largest manufacturer of boh CFCS and CFC-substitutes, reckons that, because the substitutes are far more complicated to make, they may always be two to three times as expensive as the CFCS they replace. Most manufacturers therefore expect demand for substitutes always to be less than that for CFCS. Users agree. For instance, Celotex, a Florida-based manufacturer of foam, says that the main substitute it plans to use costs at least $1.25 a pound, but because the material is more efficient, it hopes to use 20% less.
Where substitutes are available, some are themselves ozone-depleting, although less seriously than CFCS. William Reilly, head of America's Environmental Protection Agency, recently frightened users by hinting that the EPA may try to ban the production of these substitutes (called HCFCS) by 2005. Such threats have discouraged some companies from investing in their manufacture. Du Pont deliberately decided two years ago not to make HCFC-141B, one of the main substitutes.
Though most substitutes are still being tested to see whether they are toxic, likely consumers are already developing products that would use them. That inevitably carries risks. Electrolux, a Swedish company, has tried to develop a CFC-free refrigerator. It can use HFC-134A (which both Du Pont and 161 produce) as a coolant, but has had difficulties with the insulating foam, which typically contains more CFCS than the cooling system. Tests on HCFC-123, the gas Electrolux had hoped to use to make the foam, showed it was corrosive and possibly poisonous.
Replacing CFCS in refrigerators has proved especially difficult. In the United States manufacturers have to contend not only with the phase-out of CFCS, but with stricter rules governing energy efficiency. Foams made with CFC substitutes are less effective as insulators than those made with CFCS. To speed up innovation, the EPA has persuaded a group of electricity utilities to put up more than $20m to subsidise sales of the first CFC-free refrigerator. Late last month the EPA itself said that it had found an alternative coolant that was also more energy efficient than CFCS.
Replacing CFCS has gone much faster in the electronics industry, which has used CFC-113 as a cleaner. In some countries the industry has already stopped using it, switching to water-based cleaners or to technologies which make cleaning unnecessary. A recent report by the OECD on the electronics industry in Asia's industrialising countries found evidence that, in this price-competitive industry, financial sticks and carrots could speed up change. The American CFC tax, which applies to products containing or made with CFCS as well as to the chemicals themselves, has spurred Asian electronics firms to find CFC replacements.
Quotas, the bluntest of all government instruments, have also helped. The OECD fund that the three countries where CFC consumption had fallen or hardly risen--Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong-had all restricted imports to 1986 levels. Singapore auctions half its import quota to CFC users, thus creaming off revenue that might otherwise go to producers. The government uses the money to subsidise recycling and replacement."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224157300/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/40?accountid=14657,"There are clever lawyers and dim ones, fast runners and slow ones, artistic cooks and mush merchants. When it comes to investment, however, this human variety seems to disappear. Numerous studies suggest that ""exceptional"" investment managers do not exist. In any given period, each has no more than an even chance of doing better than the market index; moreover, a manager who does well one year is no likelier than others to do well in the next. A few funds may beat the index for, say, three years running, but these are no more common than chance would predict. Give a sample of coin-tossers three coins each. If they obey the laws of probability, one in eight will toss three heads.
This offends the many well-paid people who manage money, provide market analysis to managers, or implement the managers' decisions by executing trades. For the coin-tossing comparison has given rise to index funds, which eschew the old promises to beat the market and mimic a chosen index instead. Indexers trade little, so their transaction costs are low; they employ no analysts to predict the course of markets, so they charge modest fees. Greenwich Associates, an American research company, says that in Britain active equity managers' fees plus costs are three times those of indexers. In America active managers cost nine times as much. Small wonder that America's public pension finds index a third of their equity assets, up from next to nothing in 1980. In Britain the proportion for big pension funds approaches one-fifth.
Those who stand to lose are trying to discourage more indexation. They start with lofty arguments. Equity markets exist to allocate capital efficiently. Indexers are shirking their duty to reward good firms and punish bad ones by shoving prices up and down. Too much indexing could sap America's economy, suggests William Donaldson, the boss of the New York Stock Exchange. Adam Smith's ""invisible hand is tied behind his back"", moans an active investor called Robert Alder, in a 1990 article entitled ""Are indexed funds unAmerican?""
Besides, indexers have led the trend towards buying and selling shares without going through the exchanges. Indexers at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, which manages L9 billion ($16 billion) in index funds, ""cross"" about half of their trades, whereas BZW'S active managers do nearly all their trades on exchanges. In America the volume ofcross trades at Wells Fargo Nikko is said to exceed turnover on the Paris bourse. By taking liquidity from exchanges, cross-trading may compromise their efficiency in valuing firms.
Yet other markets happily survive both passivity and lost liquidity. Much foreign-exchange trading is done by international companies, which follow prices set by a small number of speculators rather than bet themselves. Most equity investors stay clear of futures; yet the two markets are efficiently kept in step by a few arbitragers. Similarly, a small number of sophisticated traders could presumably keep equity markets efficient, at least the large ones: prices would move to reflect new information, even if well over half the shares in a market were held in index funds. Cross-trading may reduce exchange liquidity, but it benefits savers by cutting trading fees.
The critics of indexing also mutter of bias against small companies, on which an economy's vitality arguably depends. Recently, however, passive money has flooded into funds tracking ""smallcap"" indices; at Bankers Trust, for example, less than half the $70 billion or so in index funds mimics the S&P 500. And, to the chagrin of the critics, supposedly passive index funds have distinguished themselves in corporate governance. Calpers, California's largely indexed retirement fund, has been the chief scourge of self-serving corporate managers. In London, Legal & General, a prominent indexer, votes all its shares.
Defeated on the high ground of national economic well-being, the anti-index lobby appeals to pockets as well. Some claim that the old studies of active managers' performance are outdated; computers and competition have bred new efficiency. Others admit that most active managers still lag behind market indices, but claim that a few exceptions can deliver tancy rewards.
These claims are tested by Frank Russell, an American pension-fund consultancy, in a study published in January. Like earlier ones, it shows that apparently gifted investment managers are no more common than lucky coin-tossers, and that success in one four-year period implies nothing about performance in the next. Yet Russell, along with others that are paid by pension funds to find good investment managers, refuses to relinquish the idea that such creatures exist.
The consultants argue that the performance of investment institutions is random--but not that of individuals. Gifted investors do exist; but they tend to change jobs, or to attract so much new capital that they no longer perform well. The trick, therefore, is to seek out top-performing investment managers who have stable employees; to this end, consultants now interview institutions more than they once did. Yet some doubt whether this yields tips that are any more reliable than those from analysts' visits to firms.
Indexers can afford to smile at such attacks. A more deadly threat is suicide. Indexers cannot resist the temptation to adorn their services. They have extended their repertoire of mimicry to almost any index imaginable: small-cap, high-yielders, environmentally friendly, South Africa-free. They supplement investment income with stock-lending. And they spice their simple tracking services with a variety of ""tilts"".
County NatWest Investment Management, a leading London indexer, recently launched a fund that tracks the portfolio shifts of other London managers.

When it comes to investment, however, this human variety seems to disappear. Numerous studies suggest that ""exceptional"" investment managers do not exist. In any given period, each has no more than an even chance of doing better than the market index; moreover, a manager who does well one year is no likelier than others to do well in the next. A few funds may beat the index for, say, three years running, but these are no more common than chance would predict. Give a sample of coin-tossers three coins each. If they obey the laws of probability, one in eight will toss three heads.
This offends the many well-paid people who manage money, provide market analysis to managers, or implement the managers' decisions by executing trades. For the coin-tossing comparison has given rise to index funds, which eschew the old promises to beat the market and mimic a chosen index instead. Indexers trade little, so their transaction costs are low; they employ no analysts to predict the course of markets, so they change modest fees. Greenwich Associates, an American research company, says that in Britain active equity managers' fees plus costs are three times those of indexers. In America active managers cost nine times as much. Small wonder that America's public pension funds index a third of their equity assets, up from next to nothing in 1980. In Britain the proportion for big pension funds approaches one-fifth.
Those who stand to lose are trying to discourage more indexation. They start with lofty arguments. Equity markets exist to all locate capital efficiently. Indexers are shirking their duty to reward good firms and punish bad ones by shoving prices up and down. Too much indexing could sap America's economy, suggests William Donaldson, the boss of the New York Stock Exchange. Adam Smith's ""invisible hand is tied behind his back"", moans an active investor called Robert Alder, in a 1990 article entitled ""Are indexed funds unAmerican?""
Besides, indexers have led the trend towards buying and selling shares without going through the exchanges. Indexers at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, which manages L9 billion ($16 billion) in index funds, ""cross"" about half of their trades, whereas BZW'S active managers do nearly all their trades on exchanges. In America the volume of cross trades at Wells Fargo Nikko is said to exceed turnover on the Paris bourse. By taking liquidity from exchanges, cross-trading may compromise their efficiency in valuing firms.
Yet other markets happily survive both passivity and lost liquidity. Much foreign-exchange trading is done by international companies, which follow prices set by a small number of speculators rather than bet themselves. Most equity investors stay clear of futures; yet the two markets are efficiently kept in step by a few arbitraders. Similarly, a small number of sophisticated traders could presumably keep equity markets efficient, at least the large ones: prices would move to reflect new information, even if well over half the shares in a market were held in index funds. Cross-trading may reduce exchange liquidity, but it benefits savers by cutting trading fees.
The critics of indexing also mutter of bias against small companies, on which an economy's vitality arguably depends. Recently, however, passive money has flooded into funds tracking ""small-cap"" indices; at Bankers Trust, for example, less than half the $70 billion or so in index funds mimics the S&P 500. And, to the chagrin of the critics, supposedly passive index funds have distinguished themselves in corporate governance. Calpers, California's largely indexed retirement fund, has been the chief scourge of self-serving corporate managers. In London, Legal & General, a prominent indexer, votes all its shares.
Defeated on the high ground of national economic well-being the anti-index lobby appeals to pockets as well. Some claim that the old studies of active managers' performance are outdated; computers and competition have bred new efficiency. Others admit that most active managers still lag behind market indices, but claim that a exceptions can deliver fancy rewards.
These claims are tested by Frank Russell, an American pension-fund constancy, in a study published in January. Like earlier ones, it shows that apparently gifted investment managers are no more common than lucky coin-tossers, and that success in one four-year period implies nothing about performance in the next. Yet Russell, along with others that are paid by pension funds to find good investment managers, reuses to relinquish the idea that such creatures exist.
The consultants argue that the performance of investment institutions is random--but not that of individuals. Gifted investors do exist; but they tend to change jobs, or to attract so much new capital that they no loner perform well. The trick, therefore, is to seek out top-performing investment managers who have stable employees; to this end, consultants now interview institutions more than they once did. Yet some doubt whether this yields tips that are any more reliable than those from analysts' visits to firms.
Indexers can afford to smile at such attacks. A more deadly threat is suicide. Indexers cannot resist the temptation to adorn their services. They have extended their repertoire of mimicry to almost any index imaginable: small-cap, high-yielders, environmentally friendly, South Africa-free. They supplement investment income with stock-lending. And they spice their simple tracking services with a variety of ""tilts"".
County NatWest Investment Management, a leading London indexer, recently launched a fund that tracks the portfolio shifts of other London managers. Bankers Trust offers an S&P-500 fund which weights all shares equally; this involves selling shares when they rise and buying losers each time the fund is rebalanced, to contrarians' delight.

But even bankers can have too much of a good thing. They are starting to worry that, if low interest rates persist, they will leave a sour taste.
So far, it has all been mouth-watering. The rates that banks pay to raise money have fallen more sharply than those they charge to borrowers. The net interest margins (net interest received, divided by assets) of America's 100 biggest banks increased from 4.11% to 4.21% last year, according to IBCA, a bank-rating agency. It was the first time that margins had widened year-on-year since the mid-1980s.
Despite tumbling deposit rates, most savers did not start shifting money out of the banks until the last two months of 1991, and then it was mostly their maturing time deposits. With returns of less than 4% on passbook savings and certificates of deposits, many have switched to mutual funds--and the preferred stock of the banks themselves.
Banks raised $4.2 billion in preferred stock in 1991, compared with $3.3 billion in common stock. They are likely to raise more in 1992. Investors like preferred stock, because it provides a fixed dividend. So do banks; these days it allows them to raise capital more cheaply than other sorts of equity or debt. Preferred stock also lets banks boost their tier-one (core) capital without diluting existing shareholders' stakes.
Yet lower interest rates have also brought problems, beginning with a flood of mortgage refinancings. The Mortgage Bankers Association reckons that these will cost banks $22 billion in forgone interest this year. Banks can soften the fall by charging to refinance, but, as BankAmerica has found, customers revolt if the fees get too fat.
The bigger worry for bankers is that they are exposing themselves to interest-rate risk by refinancing 30-year fixed mortgages at the lowest interest rates in 27 years. It is expensive to hedge a 30-year exposure. But banks that do not hedge (or sell the loans, perhaps repackaged as securities) risk a rerun of the crippling interest-rate squeeze that the thrifts and some banks suffered in the early 1980s. Renewed inflation would send interest rates soaring again.
A long spell of low interest rates might also put pressure on net interest margins. Last year's improvement was already waning in the fourth quarter, before the Fed's big interest-rate cut in December. In half of the 22 big banks followed by George Salem, Prudential Securities' bank analyst, margins narrowed in the last three months of 1991.
If current trends continue, more loans will roll over to lower rates and banks may find themselves unable to cut deposit costs to match. Lower loan demand last year meant they could afford to lose deposits. If demand pickS up with the economy, banks may have to bid more for their money.
With an election looming, there will also be pressure to lower consumer-lending rates, which have come down only half as quickly as interest rates on deposits. Last year politicians went after interest on credit cards. They are now bashing banks for pushing up mortgage rates, which have risen by about half a percentage point over the past two weeks. Because so many mortgages are securitised, interest on them is more closely tied to long-term bond yields than to the federal-funds rate (one measure of the banks' own cost of money). That is a point politicians will no doubt overlook.
Retail banks are fretting about the erosion oftheir deposit base, as savers flee bank accounts for securities. Walter Shipley, head of the newly merged Chemical Bank, warns that, if low interest rates persist for long, the bank will have to close even more of the former Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover branches than it now plans to. There is a deeper demographic worry, as well: that baby-boomers will turn from borrowers to savers by the end of the century. Banks dare not lose them now by offering less on their deposits, for fear they will never return.
To prevent defections, banks are also trying harder to sell investment products like mutual funds, bonds and annuities. In New York, Citicorp runs advertisements claiming that ""Wall Street is moving to Citicorp"". In Utah, Idaho and Oregon, BancOne is experimenting with ""investment centres"". Many banks are creating their own mutual funds, which produce repeated management fees rather than a one-off commission from a mutual-fund company.
Boosting fees is one way in which bankers have long been trying to offset the decline in revenues from lending. Big banks have also plunged into trading--bonds, foreign exchange and equity derivatives. These are inherently volatile and can create huge off-balance-sheet liabilities. If lasting low interest rates lead banks to gulp down trading as avidly as they swallowed lending to third-world countries, over-borrowed companies and property developers, the aftertaste will be nasty indeed."

Impatient foreign investors in Tokyo's depressed stockmarket like to think that falling yen interest rates will soon force Japanese life insurers to buy shares again. They delude themselves.
Life insurance companies are Japan's biggest institutional investors, with total assets of Y137 trillion ($1 trillion) at the end of October 1991. So signs of continuing bearishness from Nippon Life--the largest life insurer and investor in the Japanese stockmarket, of which it owns some 3%--will dishearten wobbling gaijin; where Nippon Life leads, its rivals tend to follow. Folk there reckon that life insurers will have only 20% of their assets in Japanese shares by 1995, compared with the 25% (including those in tokkin, or special trust accounts) that they now have.
Life insurers have been selling Japanese shares in recent months; since September, they have unloaded, net, Y162 billion-worth, mainly to foreiners. They plan to do much the same in the financial year that begins in April. Word from within Nippon Life is that it will invest atmost 5% of its new money in Japanese shares (and nothing at all in foreign securities--which is bad news for America's Treasury). Instead, 40-50% ofthe new money will probably be lent domestically (to, among others, Japan's capital-needy banks), 20-30% placed in yen cash deposits, 10% in yen bonds and 5% in property.
Foreign investors had hoped that as interest rates kept falling, insurers would move into the stockmarket--the normal pattern in past cycles. Japan's cartelised life insurers aim to pay policyholders an annual return of around 6.5%. If they can no longer earn that much risk-free by holding yen bonds or cash deposits, then buying shares looks better. And interest rates have long since fallen below 6%.
But foreign optimists neglect two points. First, life insurers no longer expect to get any capital gains out of the stockmarket. That matters less than in many countries, because life insurers in Japan are still required to pay policyholders out of income. So the second point is more important. From next year insurers will probably have to start competing on price. A debate on deregulation has been rumbling since 1989, and a special committee is to produce a report this summer. It is likely to propose that insurers be freed gradually to pay policyholders whatever dividend they please. That will put pressure on investment returns.
Keener than before to secure good income, life insurers have concluded, not unreasonably, that they own too many Japanese shares, which yield only 0.8%. Yet insurers have no wish to see a further plunge in the price of equities, since they already own so many. They think that the stockmarket will hover around its present level for the next three years or so. And they hope to shrink their Japanese shareholdings from 25% to 20% of total assets by their own continued asset growth, not by dumping shares.
This may be too much to hope for. Life insurers' assets are increasing at about 8% a year, but may well stop doing so. Foreign investors could easily tire of waiting for Japan's institutions to buy. And if foreigners start selling, Tokyo's stockmarket is really in trouble."
7-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224165458/fulltext/97A3D10CC470435APQ/44?accountid=14657,"Since early 1989 the Federal Reserve has pushed down America's short-term interest rates from 10% to just over 4%. It is powerless to reduce long-term ones, however. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds are nudging 8%, barely one percentage point below their level of three years ago. Many Americans fret that high bond yields--which feed through into mortgage rates and the long-term cost of corporate borrowing--could stifle economic recovery. In fact, the large gap between short-and long-term interest rates could signal precisely the opposite--that recovery will be stronger than expected.
The yield curve, which traces yields on securities of varying maturities, normally slopes upwards because investors demand higher yields on long-term securities to make up ter their greater risk. But the shape of the yield curve can change. For example, when short-term interest rates are raised, the curve can become inverted--ie, long-term rates can fall below short-term rates--as in America in 1989, or in Germany today. At the other extreme, America's yield curve now slopes up more steeply than at any time since the war.
Some economists reckon that the slope ofthe yield curve is a good measure of the tightness of monetary policy. It can certainly be more useful than money-supply measures, which often mislead. The shape of the yield curve reflects investors' expectations about inflation. When they expect higher future inflation, they demand bigger long-term yields on their money. So if the curve is steeply upward-sloping, it suggests that monetary policy is relatively loose. If the yield curve is inverted, it means that policy is tight.
America's broad measure of money, M3, tell by 1.3% in real terms in the 12 months to January. Some argue that this shows the Fed's monetary policy to be too tight. But the shape of the yield curve suggests, on the contrary, that monetary policy has not been so loose for 50 years.
Taking the argument a stage further, the shape of the yield curve might be seen as a leading indicator of economic activity. A steeply upward-sloping curve (ie, a loose monetary policy) could suggest that future output will rise, at least in the short term. The more the curve slopes downward, the greater the risk that tight monetary policy will choke off growth.
A recent study* concludes that the slope of the yield curve has been one of the best predicters of changes in activity between a year and 18 months ahead. Its forecasting record is better than that of three rivals: the index of leading indicators, real short-term interest rates and consensus GNP forecasts.
Between 1955 and 1989 there were six recessions in America. The study shows that all six were preceded by a flattening or inversion of the yield curve. Moreover, there was only one false alarm: an inversion of the curve in 1966 was not followed by recession. Periods when the curve switched to being upward-sloping were always tellowed by economic growth a year or so later.
The chart shows America's GNP growth plotted against the gap between short-and long-term interest rates a year earlier (so the interest-rate spread at the end of 1990 is plotted in the chart at the end of 1991). (Chart omitted) The inversion of the yield curve in 1989 heralded the recession that followed, though it arrived with a rather longer lag than most of its predecessors. More relevant to what happens next, in each of the past six business cycles the yield curve was at its steepest within a few months ofthe end of the recession. If such historical relationships hold now, today's record spread suggests that a strong rebound is imminent.
In Germany, by contrast, where the correlation between the yield curve and growth has been an even more reliable indicator of coming economic activity than in America, the yield curve has been inverted for more than a year. On past experience, this means that Germany will see a full recession--that is, a year-on-year drop in output-in 1992.
Some argue that the unusually large spread between short-and long-term interest rates in America has been exaggerated by two related factors keeping bond yields high. The first is the huge increase in the supply of bonds needed to finance America's budget deficit, which is heading for a record $400 billion in the current fiscal year. And second, Japanese investors have lost their appetite for American Treasury bonds. In 1991 the Japanese spent a net $8.6 billion on Treasury bonds, far less than the $37.8 billion they bought in 1988.
A more significant reason for the steepness of the yield curve must be that investors do not believe inflation will remain low. American consumer prices rose by 2.6% in the 12 months to January, but the underlying inflation rate is still around 4%. Worse, the markets fear that in an election year Congress might over-stimulate the economy through tax cuts, while the Fed lowers interest rates too much. Such enthusiastic stoking means that the long-expected recovery could be powerful-perhaps too powerful--when it arrives.
It is of course possible that the old relationship between the yield curve and GNP has broken down. David Morrison, an economist at Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, suggests that financial deregulation and the hangover from the borrowing binge of the 1980s may have severed the link. Even so, he says, the steep yield curve suggests that there has been a lot of monetary stimulus. If businesses and consumers start borrowing again, it will fuel a recovery.
In early 1989 most economists refused to believe that the inversion of the yield curve signalled a recession. They argued that the link with the business cycle was weaker, because deregulation had made the economy less sensitive to changes in interest rates. Now it seems that they were wrong: recession did follow, albeit with a longer lag than usual. Economists today ignore the yield curve at their peril.

But in the new, more competitive Europe, their cosy, personal style of relationship banking looks threatened. The battle for control of Source Perrier, producer of sparkling water, demonstrates the difficulties Lazard faces.
The Perrier spat has pitted against one another two erstwhile corporate allies, Italy's Agnelli family, which controls the Fiat car company, and BSN, France's leading food group. The row has been growing since November 1991, when the Agnellis bid for Exor, a holding company which controls 35% of Perrier. This upset BSN, which feared the Agnellis might turn Perrier into a powerful competitor and then try to swallow BSN too. To block the Italians, the French group allied itself with Switzerland's Nestle, which has launched its own bid for Perrier.
Lazard Freres, one of France's leading merchant banks, has been caught in the crossfire. Michel David-Weill, the head of the bank, is a friend of Gianni Agnelli, chief of the Italian dynasty; he is even a board member ofthe Agnellis' main holding company. Mr. David-Weill is also a deputy chairman of BSN and an adviser to Antoine Riboud, the group's chief executive.
Indeed, it was Lazard which brought the two together. Lazard knew that BSN was looking for friendly shareholders, and that Mr Agnelli was keen to diversify into food. In 1987 the bank engineered a deal in which the Agnellis took 5.8% of BSN, and the food company bought a small stake in an Agnelli holding company. The Agnellis later helped BSN expand its Italian operations.
Lazard hoped to profit from this link. But the Agnellis' decision to take control of Ferrier without telling Mr Riboud (or Lazard) upset its plans. Though it risks ruining its relationship with the Agnellis, Lazard has joined the BSN camp and helped to organise Nestle's counter-bid.
Lazard is proving that it is a loyal friend to its French clients. Jean-Claude Haas, a senior partner at the bank and another advisor to Mr Riboud, says Lazard is supporting BSN because it has ""emotional ties"" to the firm. In 1968 the bank advised BSN, then a glass maker, to launch a bid for Saint Gobain, a bigger rival. Though BSN lost, the company has since switched successfully from bottles to biscuits, with Lazard's help. Lazard has also organised a poison-pill defence for BSN in which the bank, which owns 6% of BSN's shares, plays a key role.
The puzzle in the Perrier affair is why the Agnellis did not seek Lazard's advice before pursuing the company. It seems all the more surprising because Lazard has close links to Mediobanca, the secretive Italian merchant bank which works closely with the Agnelli family. Lazard owns 2% of Mediobanca, and Antoine Bernheim, another of Lazard's senior partners, sits on its board.
Mr Haas says the Agnellis did not bother to consult Lazard because they underestimated the impact their bid would have in France. A more likely reason is that the Agnellis felt they no longer needed Lazard's help. After using it for several years to gain access to the French business establishment, the Agnellis had already left Lazard out of several French deals, including a share-and asset-swap with Alcatel-Alsthom, a big engineering company, in October 1990.
Adding insult to injury, the Agnellis went to a commercial bank, Societe Generale, for advice on the Exor deal. This particularly infuriated Lazard. It also led to speculation that the Italians did not want to involve Lazard in the deal precisely because of its ""emotional ties"" to BSN. Had Mr Riboud learnt of the Italians' intentions via Lazard, he might have tried to block the deal sooner.
Such conflicts of interest are common in France. Lazard Freres has sisters in Britain and America; unlike them, Lazard Freres operates in a market where a tiny elite still dominates business.
Lazard is particularly vulnerable. Each of the bank's 14 partners jealously guards the interests of his pet clients. This leads to frequent in-fighting. After one legendary row between Mr Bernheim and Bruno Roger, another partner, over whose client the bank should support in a corporate battle, the two were dubbed ""les freres-ennemis"".
In spite of these conflicts, Lazard remains top of the league in French mergers and acquisitions. For how much longer? As the Perrier episode shows, in the new Europe old loyalties can be a hindrance. A growing number of industries are being restructured on pan-European lines. Lazard's French rivals (Banque Paribas, for one) and arriviste Americans which, like Goldman Sachs, have set up shop in Paris, will be quick to exploit this weakness."

Its estate-agency business is still losing money. Bad-debt provisions trebled last year, and operating costs rose by a quarter.
Yet in the bomb site that is British banking today, Abbey National looks wonderfully wise. Peter Birch, its chief executive, has insisted on avoiding the commercial loans that have dragged down its rivals. It has lent more carefully than many to individuals: mortgages in arrears were 1.8% of total home loans last year, against an average for all mortage lenders of 2.8%. Its bad-debt provisions were only a tenth as large as those of much-bigger Barclays (see table).(Table omitted)
With pre-tax profits of L618m ($1.1 billion) last year, Abbey National ranks second to Lloyds on most measures of profitability, and ahead of it on dividend cover. Its share price fell almost 4% on the news of its results--mainly because the market expected them. But there are reasons to wonder whether Abbey National will keep on out-performing most of its rivals so strongly.
Costs, curiously, are not one of them. In banking as in other fields, when the going gets tough, the tough get cost-cutting. Abbey National's 25% rise in operating expenses in 1991 looks alarming. But as its chairman, Sir Christopher Tugendhat, points out, unlike its eriatric rivals, Abbey National is a young, growing bank. Despite spending on branches, technology and even new staff, operating expenses remain at 45% of net operating income. The bank will have to cut costs, but this is not yet a serious worry.
A more immediate concern is whether its treasury can continue to make so much money (L62m in 1991, or a tenth of pre-tax profits). Treasury assets grew from L6.8 billion in 1989 to L16 billion last year, including L5 billion-worth of American mortgage-backed securities. Abbey National's strong credit rating allows it to borrow cheaply; it managed a margin on these assets of one-third to one-half a percentage point. The bank is unlikely to be so lucky again; a flattening of America's unusually steep yield curve, for one thing, might hurt.
The next question is whether the bank can get good value from its L285m purchase of Scottish Mutual Life Assurance. From January 31st 1993 it intends to sell half a dozen of its own life-insurance products, throuh branches and a direct sales force. If the integration works, the bank will be on to a winner. But making bancassurance work is no easy task, and Scottish Mutual had problems before Abbey came along.
The last, and least answerable, conundrum is whether Abbey National will be able to branch out of overbanked Britain without running into worse problems elsewhere. It has small operations in France and Spain, and is modestly expanding in Italy. In principle, Spain and Italy are the right places: home-ownership is high, and mortgages are hard to come by and expensive. Yet Italy has been the graveyard of at least one big British banking hope, and Spain is changing too fast to call."

Under attack is the famous capital-asset pricing model (CAPM), widely used to assess risk and return. A new paper by two Chicago economists, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, explodes that model by showing that its key analytical tool does not explain returns on shares differ.*
According to the CAPM, returns reflect risk. The model uses a measure called beta--shorthand for relative volatility--to compare the riskiness of one share with that of the whole market, on the basis of past price changes. A share with a beta of one is just as risky as the market; one with a beta of 0.5 is less risky. Because investors need to earn more on riskier investments, share prices will reflect the requirement for higher-than-average returns on shares with higher betas.
Whether beta does predict returns has long been debated. Studies have found that market capitalisation, price/earnings ratios, leverage and book-to-market ratios do just as well. Messrs Fama and French are clear: beta is not a good guide.
The two economists look at all non-financial-shares traded on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ between 1963 and 1990. The shares were grouped into portfolios. When grouped solely on the basis of size (that is, market capitalisation), the CAPM worked--but each portfolio contained a wide range of betas. So the authors grouped shares of similar beta and size. Betas now were a bad guide to returns.
Instead of beta, say Messrs Fama and French, differences in firm size and in the ratio of book value to market value explain differences in returns--especially the latter. When shares were grouped by book-to-market ratios, the gap in returns between the porfolio with the lowest ratio and that with the highest was farwider than when shares were grouped by size.
So should analysts stop using the CAPM? Probably not. Although Mr Fama and Mr French have produced intriguing results, they lack a theory to explain them. Their best hope is that size and book-to-market ratios are proxies for other fundamentals. For instance, a high book-to-market ratio may indicate a firm in trouble; its earnings prospects might thus be especially sensitive to economic conditions, so its shares would need to earn a higher return than its beta suggested.
Advocates of CAPM--including Fischer Black, of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, and William Sharpe of Stanford University, who won the Nobel prize for economics in 1990--reckon the results of the new study can be explained without discarding beta. Investors may irrationally favour big firms. Or they may lack the cash to buy enough shares to spread risk completely, so that risk and return are not perfectly matched in the market.
Those looking for a theoretical alternative to CAPM will find little satisfaction, however. Voguish rivals, such as the ""arbitrage-pricing theory"", are no better than CAPM and betas at explaining actual share returns. Which leaves Wall Street with an awkward choice: believe the Fama-French evidence, despite its theoretical vacuum, and use size and the book-to-market ratios as a guide to returns; or stick with a theory that, despite the data, is built on impeccable logic."

Take a favourite cliche in Japanese financial circles: that Bank of Tokyo, with consolidated assets of Y34.5 trillion ($26.6 billion), needs to merge. It does not have a big enough domestic branch network to survive on its own, people say. It needs new capital to cover its greater-than-average exposure to third-world debt. And the law that has banned it (and the long-term credit banks) from merging with other financial institutions is due to be amended this year.
The change will give the bank a freer hand to shape its future. But it is wrong to say that weakness requires it to merge. It would be foolish to do so. For Bank of Tokyo is stronger than most of its city-bank (ie, big commercial-bank) rivals. Its capital at the end of September 1991 was 8.44% of risk-weighted assets, no worse than other Japanese banks. And it has other advantages.
With its specialist niches, Bank of Tokyo is a rarity in Japan's copycat banking world. As the country's only specialised ""foreign-exchange bank"", it once had a legal monopoly on making foreign-exchange loans, and its international expertise is still remarkable. The bank has 308 branches abroad (including its subsidiaries) and only 35 in Japan. Nor has it any costly aspirations to expand its domestic network. Its subsidiary in California, Union Bank, will soon be that state's fourth-largest bank. Otherwise, Bank of Tokyo is not in the retail business. Its domestic branches serve as the first point of call for Japanese companies that need advice on operating abroad. Every branch has staff members who have worked overseas; no city bank can make that claim.
Increasingly, Bank of Tokyo does business with small and medium-sized companies. These firms now make up half its client base; a generation ago the bank dealt only with the most prominent corporate names. Its sole contact with individuals in Japan is to sell them its debentures, a privileged way to raise money permitted only to Bank of Tokyo and the long-term credit banks. Not having a big branch network keeps overheads down. Bank of Tokyo's costs were 0.39% of assets at the end of March 1991, compared with an average of 0.6% for the city banks, according to David Atkinson, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo.
The bank has another strength which it would be foolish to forfeit. It belongs to no keiretsu group of interrelated companies, and so can do business with all of them. Bank of Tokyo ranks second or third among the banks used by Japans five biggest trading companies. It also enjoys a near-monopoly on arranging Japan's official foreign-aid-financing. All this would change if it merged with Mitsubishi Bank, the most mooted partner, which belongs to the most tightly knit of the keiretsu groups.
The changing fortunes of foreign and Japanese borrowers give Bank of Tokyo a further edge. Third-world debt, of which it has more than others, is looking better; domestic debt, of which it has less, is looking worse. Third-world loans took their biggest toll on profits in the year that ended in March 1990. Bank of Tokyo has now reserved against 30% of its exposure, which was Y361 billion (or 2.86% of total loans) in September 1991. Contributions to these reserves come out of income taxed at a marginal rate of more than 50%; if the loans are written off, the bank gets the tax back. This increases its effective reserves to 67%, says Bank of Tokyo--about the same as at most British or American money-centre banks.
Its international links kept Bank of Tokyo out of the worst of the bad lending at home that Japan's bubble economy fostered. Direct loans to Property companies at the end of September 1991 were equivalent to 62% of its tier-one (core) capital; the average for the city banks was 135%, and for long-term credit banks 206%. The bank has made lots of duff loans, to non-banks and the like. But it is not the main bank to any of the most notoriously indebted property companies, and so will not be saddled with their debts if they need to be bailed out.
Bank of Tokyo's profitable international operations give it its most telling edge over Japan's other banks. It is particularly strong in nearby countries, Where Japanese companies are active and Japanese banks thin on the ground. Bank of Tokyo is the only one with branches in Indonesia and Malayasia, and is one of two in Thailand. Fatter lending spreads push up its return on assets in Asia (outside Japan) to 2%, much higher than elsewhere. Fees and commissions--on, for example, foreign-currency deals, swaps and transfer--are also strong in international business. Net fees accounted for 19% of Bank of Tokyo's revenues last year, but for only 12% at the average city bank.
In the long run, Bank of Tokyo's competeitive advantage will erode in these markets, as more banks are allowed to set up in them. Meanwhile, however, its rivals are in full retreat from the results of their ill-fated foreign-lending binge in the late 1980s. The persistent merger rumours may owe more to other banks' problems than to the Bank of Tokyo's alleged weaknesses.
Bank of Tokyo thinks the rumours have been spread by Mitsubishi Bank. This makes some sense. Mitsubishi has the soundest domestic loans of all the city banks, but has troubles abroad. Its San Francisco-based subsidiary, Bank of California, holds more doubtful debts than Union Bank, although it is only half the size. Mitsubishi is unhappy with its London wholesale branch. If it merged with Bank of Tokyo it would gain access to that bank's international network; Bank of California could also be merged with the stronger Union Bank. For Bank of Tokyo, though, such a marriage holds no charms. Why surrender its freedom to become little more than the international arm of Mitsubishi?"

So that all these activities, from opening garage doors to tracking galaxies, do not interfere with each other, countries must agree on which frequencies to use for what. The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC), which divides up the radio spectrum, ended on March 3rd, having given techno-diplomats from around the world a month in which to enjoy the subtle charms of Spain's Costa del Sol. Though less politically thorny than past WARCs, this conference had plenty of new technologies to argue about.
On most issues the conference divided into two camps. Innovative proposals backed by America ran into resistance from a lobby of 33 European countries, the Conterence of European Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). The poor countries sided with America on some issues, Europe on others. Most East European countries voted with their western neighbours. Japan lay low, despite having a delegation second in size only to Spain's.
The issue that most exercised the conference was satellite mobile telephony. In 1990 Motorola, an American telecoms-equipment manufacturer, came up with the idea of a global mobile-telephone system. Customers would be able to use hand-held telephones anywhere on the earth's surface, including the jungly, snowy or impoverished bits that ordinary networks fail to reach, with the help of 77 low earth-orbiting satellites (LEOS). The system is called Iridium, because iridium atoms have 77 electrons.
Since Iridium's birth, several rival groups, all but one American, have come up with ideas for similar services. They all want to use a single portion of the spectrum all around the world. Unsurprisingly, the American delegation championed this idea. Europe opposed it. Instead, CEPT argued that terrestial mobile telephony needed more airspace. This is partly because Europe is already well-covered by terrestrial systems which could do with more channels to accommodate more traffic; it has no problem that needs to be solved from space. More important, the big European telecoms manufacturers specialise in terrestrial equipment, and European governments are frightened of undermining existing state-owned telephone operators.
Developing countries found themselves torn between the two camps. Though keen on new ways to reach their villages, they are sensitive to issues of sovereignty. ""You don't want people walking around communicating with LEOS direct, or they will take revenues from our administration,"" said the head of the Tanzanian delegation. To reassure him and his peers, Iridium promises that its satellites will refuse to take calls from regions where it is not licensed, and that signed-up countries will get revenues.
In the early hours of March 3rd a compromise was reached. America got the two chunks of bandwidth--one at 1610-1626 megahertz (MHz) and another at 2483-2520MHz--it wants for systems like Iridium. The rival proposals now go before America's Federal Communications Commission and similar regulators in other countries, where they will jostle for individual allocations. In exchange, America let Europe take the I.S gigahertz (GHz: 1GHz=1,000MHz) slot it wanted for satellite sound broadcasting, a technology which will one day deliver CD-quality radio programmes. Since America's Defence Department uses those frequencies--which can make do with cheaper transmitters--and refuses to give them up, this means the world will not get all its satellite sound at the same frequencies, and American broadcasters will end up in a band they did not want.
A similar bargain was struck over shortwave radio. Since the mid-1980s, old hands like Radio Liberty and the BBC World Service have been joined by a host of new international stations, from Taiwan's China Broadcasting Corporation to the Church of Christ, Scientist's World Service of the Christian Science Monitor. To ease overcrowding, the rich countries proposed new short-wave slots below 10MHz. Unfortunately, developing countries use these ""tropical bands"" as a cheap way to link local radio exchanges. Richer places long ago laid cables to do the same job. In the end the broadcasters got less than they wanted; 790 kilohertz (kHz: 1MHz=1,000kHz) of new spectrum, only 200kHz of which is located below 10MHz.
The WARC also bestowed new spectrum allocations on high-definition television (HDTV), and aeroplane telephones. In both cases governments agreed on the need for a service, but had a tough time finding a global allocation for one.
America and Japan have already launched ""plane-phone"" services in the 8OOMHz range, but Europe has set aside those bands for new sorts of terrestial mobile telephone, so will use 1670-1675MHz instead. That means that airlines flying across the Atlantic will have to carry dual-standard equipment if their passengers are to be able to make calls over both continents.
HDTV ran into similar problems. Europe and Japan wanted a 21GHz band; America uses it for research satellites. America wanted 17GHz; Europe uses that for fixed telephone links. So different regions will broadcast HDTV on different frequencies. Consumer-electronics firms already had to plan on making different HDTV sets for different markets, because of variations in the technical standards for the transmissions. Now they will be a little bit more different.
This year's WARC may be the last of its kind. To make future conferences friendlier and less complicated, the International Telecommunications Union, which runs them, has come up with some new ideas. One is to hold mini-WARCs, each restricted to a narrower range of subjects, every two years. That would allow a quicker response to technological change. Countries would have less chance to horse-trade among unrelated services, obliging them to consider each more carefully on its own merits. And nobody would ever have to spend a month in Torremolinos, except by choice."

Then you step on the accelerator and the Impact lurches to life with an eerie whine, reaching 60 mph (100 kph) in eight seconds. America's General Motors (GM) hopes that this odd-looking egg that thinks it's a sports car could make electric cars popular. But driving the Impact around GM'S test track in Arizona reveals that there is a long way to go.
There is a good reason for GM to want to sell electric cars. The state of California has passed laws requiring 2% of each car maker's sales in the state to be ""zero-emission vehicles"" by 1997. By 2003 it will have to be 10%. Some 17m cars were sold in California last year. So far, only the electric car appears likely to meet the 1997 deadline, though other technologies have an outside chance.
However, there needs to be a reason for people to buy them, as well as a reason for companies to sell them. On this score, electric cars still have a big problem; petrol contains far more energy than batteries do. The 875lb (400kg) of lead-acid batteries crammed into the Impact contain no more energy than a miserly 1.5 US gallons (5.7 litres) of petrol. This means electric cars have to make the most of their energy, which explains the Impact's streamlined shape. Even with efficient design, though, its range is limited. At best it can travel 150 miles without a time-consuming recharge. Using the lights and air conditioning cuts the range still more.
Cost is another headache. Day to day, the Impact seems cheap: it can go 100 miles on about eight cents of electricity if charged up at cheap overnight rates. That is a cost equivalent to a Californian car running at 1,430 miles to the gallon. But the Impact's lead-acid batteries last only 20,000-30,000 miles. Taking battery-replacement costs into account, running an Impact costs about six to eight cents a mile, equivalent to roughly 15-20 mpg--a no gas guzzler. Other types of battery are being studied, but they all have problems. For example, many cannot deliver the sudden power output needed for rapid acceleration. That is why GM is being cautious,and sticking with conventional lead-acid batteries.
It might be possible to mix different battery types with different strengths, to get the advantages of all of them. Or it might be possible to supplement the battery. Capacitors can store electricity from batteries that disgorge it slowly and make it available all at once, thus enabling the car to accelerate rapidly. Hybrid cars--electric cars which use small petrol engines for longer trips or to recharge the battery--are also possible and in many ways attractive, but they may not satisfy the new clean-air legislation.
Electric cars need more than refined technology. They also require drivers with new skills and expectations--for the Impact certainly surprised this driver with his old skills. It uses ""regenerative braking""--the motor turns into a generator when the driver decides to slow down, turning the car's kinetic energy back into electricity which can then be stored away in the battery. The engineers have built this into the controls by giving the Impact ""one foot"" driving. Lighten your foot on the accelerator and Impact immediately slows down. Lift your foot off the accelerator and it comes to a halt as quickly as if you stepped on the brakes. It is not that difficult to do, but it is unnerving.
There are other things to get used to. With virtually no engine noise, other sounds such as the whirring of gears and the crunching of tyres on the road become disconcerting. Then there is heating, not a problem in Los Aneles, but certainly one in New York and other northern states planning to adopt zero-emission standards. A heater would use too much battery power, so the Impact has none. A gas heater is a likely solution, if the emission rules can be changed.
Another issue is safety. Many Americans distrust light cars, and may dislike them more if they have ""high voltage"" stickers on them. The recharging process needs to be made safe and foolproof. One idea GM is considering is a ""smart plug"" which would allow a vehicle to be recharged only if it is correctly connected to a power supply. It has other advantages, because it could also be used to transfer information. Potentially that would allow an electricity utility to identify the owner of a vehicle plugged into a public recharging-point, perhaps in a car park, and then to send him bill. It would also help identify a stolen car--and send a signal to disable it while the police are called. Electricity may change more aspects of motoring than anyone expected."

The chlorophyll in plants makes life on earth possible through the chemical cleverness of photosynthesis. So anything that gets rid of chlorolphyll will make the planet less green in more ways than one. After years of speculation, there is now evidence that ultraviolet light (UV) coming through the hole in the ozone over Antarctica is doing just that.
The hole forms in the stratosphere every spring as the sun's early rays set off ozone-destroying chemical reactions. Many kilometres below, the dawn also ignites a population explosion. Spring is party-time for the single-celled algae, or phytoplankton, that drift in Antarctica's waters. These algae are eaten by krill, which themselves serve as food for bigger species--appealing ones like whales, and commercially valuable ones like squid and fish. The ecosystem is a mesh composed of such chains; break one and the web may start to unravel.
Research published recently in Science suggests that the phytoplankton are reproducing less profusely than before. Oceanographers led by Ray Smith and Barbara Prezelin of the University of California at Santa Barbara spent six weeks in the Bellingshausen Sea in late 1990 measuring the verdancy of the waters--a project they called the ""Icecolors"" cruise. They found that increased UV appears to be suppressing the phytoplankton's productivity by 6-12%.
Like normal light, UV comes in different colours--with the uncolourful names A, B, C and D. The more energetic, and thus potentially more danerous, UV-C and UV-D have little practical importance; they are absorbed by the atmosphere with or without ozone. And UV-A gets through however much ozone there is. Only the passage of UV-B is affected by thinning ozone; but UV-B on its own can still cause harm.
The Icecolors team took samples of phytoplankton at several sites, some under the ozone hole and some beyond its influence. They did not measure the UV-B directly: because (like all light) it varies with factors such as cloud cover. Instead they measured the ratio of UV-B to UV-A, thus teasing out the effcts of the ozone layer. To assess biological activity, they measured the way visible light is absorbed at various depths. This gave an idea of the amount of chlorophyll and other plant pigments in the water and thus, indirectly, the amount of plant life. They also measured the carbon absorbed by the plants--the more carbon used, the more biomass the plants are producing. From these experiments the team concluded that production of organic material was lowest when the ratio of UV-B to UV-A was highest--that is, within the hole's influence.
UV-B affects phtoplankton in two ways. It interferes with photosynthesis by wrecking the chlorophyll molecules, proteins and membranes which are needed for the process; and it damages the DNA on which genes are stored, which leads to problems in growth and reproduction The phytoplankton can fight back, though. They can produce ""sun-screens"" to absorb the UV-B. Carotenoids (such as beta-carotene, the chemical that makes carrots red) do this. So do special amino-acids (though not the run-of-the-mill sort used to make proteins). Both have been found in Antarctic plankton.
If the UV-B gets through the sun-screen, various mechanisms can still repair the damage done to DNA. One such mechanism, photoreactivation, uses energy from UV-A to activate a protein called photolyase which can then unpick knots in a damaged strand of DNA. But there are snags. The protective and repair mechanisms seem to be stimulated by the level of UV-A rather than UV-B. If the UV-A level were climbing, the plants would know what to do; but they do not appear to respond to the greater danger of UV-B, suggesting that they have not encountered high UV-B levels during their recent evolution.
Some species are better at dealing with UV than others. Phaeocystis--algae that move through water by thrashing their whip-like flagell--are among those which appear badly hit. Unforunately, they seem to be the dominant species during the spring bloom. The other important group, the diatoms, are more robust. They formed less than 10% of the phytoplankton in samples taken by Icecolors. In the new, harsher environment they may become more important.
Overall productivity, therefore, may not drop all that much--but the food chains could still be damaged, as not everything which eats Phaeocystis will guzzle down the replacement. And other changes, trivial to all but the fondest algae-lovers, are also potentially worrying. Size counts as well as species. Small individuals are more vulnerable to UV than their bigger brethren, and some krill choose to feed only on the smallest, most succulent algae. These fussy eaters could find their bill of fare diminished. Look out for further rumours of breaking chains."

THE DEMOCRACY TRAP. By Graham Fuller. Dutton; 285 pages; $20.
THE DISUNITING OF AMERICA. By Arthur Schlesinger. Norton; 160 pages; $14.95
Much of Francis Fukuyama's fame rests on a misunderstanding. When he wrote that history had ended, he did not mean that the grand surge of human affairs had run its course. He simply meant that the old dialectic, those groaning railroad tracks on which Hegel and Marx saw mankind progressing (if the right people threw the switch), had reached the terminus at last. Evolution seemed to have brought man to a natural political apotheosis: liberal democracy, hand in hand with the free market.
Mr Fukuyama first put these thoughts into an obscure journal in the summer of 1989, when communism was starting to collapse and he was a consultant in the State Department. Now he has expanded them into a book, a Suzuki-style exercise of impressive but unsparkling argument. Its interest is historiographical: this is the first work of political theory to emerge from the practical evidence that Marx got it wrong.
Mr Fukuyama's original article was, if anything, too crowing. His book too has its wild-eyed moments: even Africa is claimed to be on the path of progress, and his tables show El Salvador, as well as all the flegdling countries of Eastern Europe, firmly in the liberal-democratic camp. But he also recognises that the march of liberal democracy will still encounter trip-wires, pits and the dark; and that democracy may get through, when it gets through, only in a different and disappointing shape.
The hero of the tale is Hegel, and that too is a fascinating turnabout. Hegelianism has been in disrepute for a century, condemned most notably by Karl Popper in 1945 as the missing link between Plato and the modern totalitarians. Liberals scorned Hegel for his fawning love of authority; Marx mocked him by turning his ""logic of history"" on its head, so that it led inevitably to communism. Now that Marx is definitely wrong, Mr Fukuyama argues, Hegel is rather surprisingly shown to have been right.
Hegel would be grateful; but he would be surprised, too, at the way Mr Fukuyama reads him. To hear that Hegel saw the modern constitutional state as ""the embodiment of human freedom"", and the natural end of human progress, makes him sound like a Founding Father in a powdered wig. But Hegel's view of history was metaphysical: ""absolute truth projected in time, progressing to a consummation it can never reach."" Liberal democracy is a stage on that path, but who knows how history--spirit working itself out--will work itself out next?
The notion of ""spirit"" causes problems of its own. Mr Fukuyama argues that liberal democracy has triumphed because it best allows for the ""spirited"" side of man, that side which longs for honour, recognition and esteem. Plato, in his ""Republic"", called this thymos, and recognised--as Hegel did later--that thymos could also encompass the desire to make war and enslave. Plato's guardian class, full to the brim with thymos and ambition, was not exactly a bunch of liberal democrats. But then democracy, for Plato, represented a step even lower than that: the spoils spread even thinner, and a wearying, bickering rule by the mediocre.
This last point is acknowleded, to a degree, in Mr Fukuyama's book. Triumphant liberal democracy carries with it complacency, boredom, lack of moral fibre and lack of fire. The ""last man"" of his title--a phrase borrowed, like so many of Mr Fukuyama's best phrases, from the still despised and dangerous Nietzsche--is a pathetic creature, content merely to be happy and left quiet. In such a vacuum it is possible that something more thrilling may come along, as the Nazis did on Nietzsche's coat-tails, to spin liberal democracy off course for a while.
Mr Fukuyama does not like to dwell on that. For the precise nature of these pressures on democracy, turn to Graham Fuller and Arthur Schlesinger. Mr Fuller, a former colleague of Mr Fukuyama at Rand, ""profoundly"" disagrees with his triumphalist approach. If liberal democracy has reached some sort of peak, it brings him little joy.
Liberal democracies, and the American Model above all, are fissiparous, self-absorbed and morally adrift. Tney face grave dilemmas--in particular, whether individual rights should be traded off against the good of society--which they seem powerless to resolve. Mature democracies have almost reached the srage where authoritarianism will creep in, and be gratefully received, by people groping in the murk of pluralism, relativism and fear of rocking the boat.
Mr Fuller's book roams over the sort of disquieting thoughts that bother a man just before he goes to sleep. Has the dog gone out? Is the door locked? Will the world end? What about those Islamic fundamentalists with bombs in briefcases? Much of what he says is sensible: for example, the thought that the new historical dialectic may be between those with religious faith and those without it. But too much of his book is a rehearsal of old groans. For a stronger light on a smaller area, Mr Schlesinger's book is more useful. It is also powerfully literate and articulate, an antidote to all those battering swims in the tide of history.
Ethnicity in America is his theme: a small illustration of democracy under threat. In search of Mr Fukuyama's thymos, ethnic groups in America--especially blacks--have begun to invent triumphalist histories for themselves, to demand recognition in courses and curriculums, and to assert their disgust with the works of the Anglo-Saxon Founders. Writing with the cold rage of an academic who has probably had his own courses laughed at, Mr Schlesinger points out how much America ought to mean to blacks, and how little they would have in common with Africans, were they to meet them; and he reminds them that even the most oppressed of blacks found the white Anglo-Saxon ideal,forall its hypocrisies, the most inspiring to follow.
In the end, Mr Schlesinger comforts himself with that. America will hang together because ""the resources of the creed are not yet exhausted"". The original idea of e pluribus unum is still just strong enough; it constitutes what Mr Fukuyama calls ""agreement on the rules of the game"", the glue democracies need to flourish. This may give hope to Mr Fuller, and others like him, who find themselves half-loning for the ""inspiration"" of authoritarian rule. Liberal democracy, not having quite triumphed, is not yet dull; all is still to play for."

By Michael T. Jacobs. Harvard Business School Press; 268 pages; $24.95. Distributed by McGraw-Hill; L21.95
When everyone passionately agrees about something, beware. The chances are high that everyone is wrong. If there is one thing upon which American politicians, union officials, shopfloor workers, Wall Street bankers, academics and the proverbial man in the street all agree, it is that American business is too ""short-term"". Even American businessmen concur.
The belief that short-termism is crippling American companies is so universal that it is rarely challenged, or even defined. This book deserves a large readership because it attempts to do both, and spectacularly fails, but along the way it makes some penetrating observations about how much the practice of American capitalism differs from the way most people assume it works.
Michael Jacobs was an official of America's Treasury in the first two years of the Bush administration. His brief was to shape policies that would improve American competitiveness. He seems to have begun by swallowing the conventional wisdom in one gulp. The first chapter of his book is a familiar litany describing America's supposed decline. Most of the statistics used to support this thesis are, as usual, either bogus or misleading.
Toyota does not produce half the number of cars made by General Motors with only 5% of the workforce, as Mr Jacobs contends. Toyota is primarily an assembler of parts made by suppliers. GM makes many of its own parts, so needs more workers, though certainly not as many as it now employs. The decline in America's share of the world semiconductor market from 60% to 36% between 1980 and 1988 was due to huge increases in output by Japanese firms of memory chips, the low-margin commodity end of the market where most producers are now losing money. More profitable, and sophisticated, microprocessors are still mostly made by American companies.
Mr Jacobs forgets to mention that in the 1980s America's productivity grew faster than Japan's,:though he is honest enough to point out that, in absolute terms, American productivity is still the highest in the world.
Even were America's decline conceded, that would not prove that the culprit is short-termism. Mr Jacobs himself cites studies which show that, despite much speculative (meaning short-term) trading on America's stockmarkets, there is no proof that the stockmarket itself penalises companies for investing in research and development or for making other long-term investments. Oddly, he makes little of America's low savings and investment rates, the best figures to cite for those who want to fret about short-termism. But even low investment rates are not unquestionably evil. America's productivity and exports continue to grow despite relatively modest investment.
Mr Jacob's most original contribution is to describe, in startling detail, why the model of shareholder democracy no longer works in America. Most large investing institutions, which now own about half of the publicly traded equity in America, have neither time nor inclination to exercise their ownership rights. If a firm's performance lags, they sell its shares. Institutional investors have been roundly condemned for this so-called short-term behaviour. And yet, as Mr Jacobs shows, they have little choice.
Shareholders are still technically the owners of America's biggest firms, but they have been quietly disenfranchised by state and federal laws that protect managers and workers from shareholder intervention. Launching a list of candidates to oppose the board directors nominated by managers is either too expensive for any single institution, or impossible under many state laws. Soliciting port from other investors to oppose board motions runs into rules designed by Securities and Exchange Commission to curb insider trading.
A firm's managers control the shareholders' register and can easily delay or frustrate an attempt to canvass other investors. Worse, the wave of takeovers in the 1980s has produced a crop of new laws making takeovers--most shareholders' only opportunity to voice their opinion about a firm's management--more difficult and, in some states, impossible. Small wonder disgruntled shareholders almost always sell their shares rather than try to reform a company.
What effect all this is having on American competitiveness is unclear. Mr Jacobs simply asserts that it has raised the cost of capital for American firms and so is bad, though once again he fails to prove his assertion. The gut feeling of most readers will be that he is correct, just as most people have a gut feeling that American business is indeed miserably short-termist. But, in coming to conclusions that will alter the lives and fortunes of millions of people, it is better to think with one's brain, not one's gut."

No longer. Tourism, this well-researched book* will tell you, does as much harm to the planet as any smoke-belching industry. It fouls clean seas, litters decent countryside, encases beaches in concrete, threatens rare species.
Beauty spots come under hideous pressure, often at a time of year when they can least sustain it. California's Yosemite park, on some summer days, is more densely populated than Manhattan; York, jewel of northern England, is visited each year by 30 times its population. The visitors often make huge demands on the environment: every tourist to Hawaii or Barbados uses at least six times as much water and electricity as local residents. No wonder the deepest greens argue that the only environmentally sound holiday is to stay at home.
John Elkington and Julia Hailes, though, are realists. Their earlier ""Green Consumer Guide"" has sold over 1m copies in a dozen countries not by telling people to stop consuming, but by pointing out ways to use their buying power to reduce environmental damage. This book aims to repeat that for holidays. Wisely: an industry that employs one person in 50 worldwide is hardly likely to vanish in a puff of green smoke.
Much of the Elkingon-Hailes advice is common sense. Travel out of season, to help spread the load; use trains and buses rather than aeroplanes and cars; do not leave litter, even if the locals do; stay with local people rather than in purpose-built hotels. Their league table of the greenery of various holiday activities gives five stars to smokestack tourism: ""Visit some of the sewage-treatment plants,"" they suggest; ""Go and talk to the people of whom the old sewermen would say, 'It may be crap to you people but it's just bread and butter to them.'""
Golf, though, wins no stars at all: 95% of British courses overfertilise their turf sixfold. And, though eco-tourism may help the locals see that conserving gorillas or rainforest is more lucrative than destroying them, it has to be carefully organised if it too is not to be destructive.
Greenest of all activities, the book makes clear, is asking questions, Replies from a survey of tour operators, published at the back of the book, show that many companies already think about the effects of their business on the environment. As you shelter from the ultra-violet rays that stream through the hole in the ozone layer this summer, assuage that green guilt by penning some pointed missives to hotels, airlines, etc. On recycled paper, of course."

It makes about 150 feature films a year, including co-productions; Italy comes next with around 120, then Germany and Spain with 60 each; Britain manages 40. The range and scope of French output remain impressive, even if French filmgoers have lately been giving more of their attendance money to the big imports from America.
The French brought a welcome touch of warmth and colour to Berlin, with a busy Unifrance stand and glossy displays all over town. They have cultivated a stock of creative, independent producers who can bring in good-looking movies on moderate budgets, at least by American standards. At the festival, which ended on February 25th, the French offered first and second films by directors who could become cult figures in the 1990s. A second Nouvelle Vague may be consolidating itself.
One of the best French contributions, though, came from a pre-Nouvelle Vague maverick, Eric Rohmer, who makes his films with a small cast; they feel rather like superior home movies. ""Conte d'Hiver"" is the second in a new Rohmer series, with a seasonal flavour. It has one of Rohmer's fascinating (or irritating, according to taste) heroines, who vacillates between boy friends until she meets her original lover again. It is as well written as ever; Mr Rohmer has wit and a lively ambiguity. The dialogue and the winter scenes flow seamlessly together. Charlotte Very makes an excellent new Rohmer heroine: intelligent, irascible and determined to ""classify"" her feelings even if it drives everyone mad.
The rest of the French selection combined three types of film that have been France's mainstay over the years--the period film, the fantasy film and the realist sort. Alain Corneau's ""Tout les Matins du Monde"" builds a fable around. the life of Marin Marais, a viola da gamba composer (played by the inevitable Gerard Depardieu, with Depardieu fils as his younger self). It catches its period nicely and is sober, contemplative, at times even a little dull.
Those seeking something wilder will turn to Leos Carax's ""Les Amants du PontNeuf"", about two hapless lovers who sleep among the derelicts on the bridge. Its main attraction is a gigantic set of this bit of Paris, which looks remarkably convincing, a fantastic firework display that covers the entire set, and a bizarre episode of water-skiing down the Seine. The final shot--the lovers on the prow of a barge going down the river--recalls Vigo's ""L'Atalante"".
Yet the realist tradition lives on in France, despite the knocks it took firom the more pretentious Nouvelle Vague directors. ""Nord"", the first work by a director-actor called Xavier Beauvois, is impressively sober and un-tricksy despite its subject: a study in frustration and madness as an elderly chemist turns on his family. Its mood of growing claustrophobia contrasts with its sunny, smalltown streets. Mr Beauvois, who also plays the chemist's son, made the festival's most promising debut with this grim and unsettling film.
The Germans, on the other hand, who provided the next biggest contribution, are confused. They are still groping for a way through the psychological consequences of their country's reunification, and the practical difficulties caused by the fact that many of their best film artists have left Germany.
Several films dealt with East Germans wanting to be West Germans (and occasionally vice versa) and the nagging doubt about who is whose master. Some are too parochial for easy export (and talking-head documentaries cost a fortune in subtitling). Still, something personal occasionally emerges from the polemics. Ula Stockl's ""The Old Song"" is about the reuniting of a divided family in Dresden. Without raising its voice, it lets you feel what it is like to come together again. The easing of the old eastwest tensions is made palpable. When the camera lifs to beautiful Dresden, it is hard not to feel the finger of history brushing by.
It was left to Doris Dorrie, whose best-known film is ""Men"", to show that the German cinema can still be entertaining, well-made--and fun. The hero of ""Happy Birthday, Turke!"" is a Turkish private eye who, in the best traditions of film noir, is hurled into an impenetrable plot in which he gets beaten up and then becomes a murder suspect. Ms Dorrie carries the story along vigrously. Hansa Czypionka, a German, is good as the hapless gumshoe. The Turks who play alongside him make the most of the jokes. Even though some of the violence is distinctly too much, this is Ms Dorrie's best film for years."

""Hitlerjunge Salomon"" (English title ""Europa, Europa"") is the story of the early life of Salomon Peres, a German Jew now living in Israel. To see it, you had to go to one of two independent cinemas in east Berlin and they gave it only an irregular showing.
The Peres family fled from Hitler's Germany to Poland, where two years later the Nazi terror caught up with them. Salomon moved farther east, and the Red Army put him into an orphanage. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union, he saved his life by claiming to be an ethnic German. A Prussian officer took him under his wing and arranged for him to be sent to a Hitler Youth school in Germany. At the end of the war Salomon was reunited with one of his brothers, a concentration-camp survivor. The rest of the family had perished in the Warsaw ghetto.
The film breaks a modern German taboo about how to approach the Jewish question. The cynical opportunism with which Salomon pursues his quest for survival; the occasional humour that flashes through the film; Salomon's passion for a young Nazi girl (frustrated because he cannot reveal his circumcised penis): all this is uncomfortable for German audiences used to seeing Jews portrayed as mere victims.
Something was too much, anyway, for the commission that decides which German films should be nominated for the Oscar awards. Despite an enthusiastic reception abroad, ""Hitlerjunge Salomon"" was not deemed worthy to represent Germany in the Oscar competition; and, lo, it did not make it to the Berlin festival.
The commission's decision set off an argument that reached well beyond Germany. The Polish director of the film, Agnieszka Holland, told the New York Times that it revealed two German characteristics that had been hidden for decades: arrogance and, she felt, dislike of foreigners. The film's producer, Artur Brauner, has said that the commission's decision is evidence of the Germans' renewed will to decide what is right and wrong, even if others disagree. Mr Brauner is a veteran of the German film industry. A Polish Jew, he arrived in Berin in 1945 and has made some of the most commercially successful of German films.
The story may not be over. In America the film has gone down well with both critics and the box office. In California it has picked up the Golden Globe award (which in Germany has been taken as a snub to the commission). It has now been announced that, whatever the German commission felt about its Oscar qualifications, Salomon's story has been accepted as a competitor for an Oscar in the Best Screenplay category."

Once they meant heavy oak fittings, drowsing tramps and whispering spinsters; now they offer Meccano shelving, computers and leaflets on non-sexist reading. And this is not the worst of it. According to the Library Association, the system faces ""a catastrophe"": its worst momemt since 1850, when modern lending libraries were born.
Opening hours are dwindling steadily. In 1974, 229 libraries were open for more than 60 hours a week; now 17 are. In 1985, 645m books were lent; in 1991, 565m. Libraries are rarely shut down altogether (Derbyshire is an exception, closing 11 libraries over the past decade), but librarians maintain that they are being steadily undermined.
February 27th was a day of protest, when librarians and literary supporters (Alice Thomas Ellis, Michael Holroyd) went to the House of Commons to make their case. The arts minister, Timothy Renton, did not turn up. He has told the Library Association that public expenditure on libraries has gone up by 18% in real terms over the past ten years, that self-generated income (from book reservations, fines and use of computer databases) has risen by 71%, and that 29 new buildings or extensions have been built. He has also pointed out that library services are the responsibility of local authorities. If they choose not to give libraries high priority, Mr Renton can ask why (as he has asked Derbyshire), but he cannot make them change their ways.
There the two sides stand. Britain still has 4,783 public libraries, lending the equivalent of ten books a year to every man, woman and child at a cost of 23p a head a week. They are not open quite as long as they used to be, and not buying or lending books at quite the old rate, yet they can hardly be called endangered. Many factors are at work, beyond the meanness or indifference of central government. People are reading less; the reduction in opening hours my reflect that, rather than the other way round. Books are giving way to screens; so libraries feel obliged to go expensively into computers, although these are not necessarily a better way to get knowledge into young heads.
Most of all, libraries are often political pawns. Councils talk of closing them because this sort of ""saving"" galvanises middle-class voters. The rate-capped Labour-boroughs of London play this game, threatening to shut libraries, relenting, threatening again. Mr Renton is not entirely wrong to tell the librarians to complain to their local authorities, not to him. Yet the minister also has an obligation, under statute, to ""improve the library service""; and, with the best will in the world, he cannot be said to have done that."

Unhappily, despite the end of the cold war and the cascade of weapons cuts announced by America and Russia, the fears are still there. Twenty years ago, when efforts began to ban new bomb-builders, pessimists predicted that by now there would be 20 or 30 thrusting new nuclear powers (besides the famous five: America, Russia, Britain, France and China). They were wrong. Twenty months from now, however, their gloomy prediction could start to come true. The spread of the bomb poses the biggest threat to the fragile new world order. coping with it will take cash, co-operation and strong nerves. It is barely do-able, and time is short.
That is because the end of the cold war in Europe has left nervous ex-clients elsewhere reaching for new means of defence, and ambitious ex-clients reaching for new means of aggression. The Soviet collapse has raised fears that would-be bomb-makers, from Iran to North Korea, may get their hands on Soviet nuclear skills, weapons or materials (see pages 45-47). But the really bad news is what Iraq had been up to under the noses of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It shows that, against a determined cheat, existing safeguards are alarmingly inadequate.
So, time to bolt for the bunker? Not quite. Shock at the scale of Iraq's clandestine weapons-building has jolted the United Nations Security Council into life. Russia has emerged from the rubble of the old Soviet Union anxious to do its bit to help the bomb-busters. Even China has joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT); France, the last of the five declared nuclear powers, is about to do so. As rivalry among the big five gives way to co-operation, there is as good an opportunity now as there ever will be to stop the bomb-builders. After all, today's nuclear delinquents got their start in the days when rival big powers egged them on, or at least turned a blind eye.
But stopping the spread will not be easy. International safeguards must be strengthened; those who have no bomb must be reassured that they are still safe without it; and the small group of cheaters must be sat on, hard.
ALL IN A GOOD CAUSE
The NPT and the safeguards agreement that each member is obliged to have with the IAEA are the first line of defence against illicit bomb-building. As Iraq has shown, the promise not to build the bomb is worthless unless the IAEA'S bomb-busters are given real clout. At a minimum that means the right to carry out challenge inspections at short notice. It means more random inspections of nuclear reactors to make sure that their fuel is not being diverted to military use. And it means the right to check on all nuclear facilities, not just the places where fuel is kept. All this will cost money, far more than the derisory $62m (roughly the cost of one slap-up fighter aircraft) allotted for the IAEA'S entire safeguarding budget last year. In this business, you get what you pay for.
The systematic nuclear frisking of Iraq is being done on special instructions from the Security Council. Future cheats will probably not be vanquished in war; some may not be NPT members. Yet all should likewise be named and, if they have signed the NPT, searched and, where necessary, reproved with sanctions. Nor should the duties of staying in the NPT be easily shirked by leaving. Non-signers and resigners who wish to do nuclear business with NPT Members should be obliged to accept the full range of checks on their nuclear facilities, too. Together with tighter controls on the high-tech bits and pieces that can be used to make nuclear weapons (and missiles to carry them), much can be done to make it harder and more costly for the bomb-in-the-basement brigade. Renegades who try to go it alone should have aid and know-how for their civilian economy cut off, too.
But tighter controls will still not be foolproof. Just as important is persuading countries at the nuclear threshold (most of them non-NPT members) or close to it NPT cheats like Iraq and North Korea) to step away. Impossible? Argentina and Brazil recently abandoned their nuclear ambitions for a confidence-building regime of mutual inspections. India built the bomb out of fear of China; Pakistan did it because India did. Both may think they now n less risk of conflict, but they also run a higher risk should conflict erupt. Proposals for mutual inspections to bolster a South Asian nuclear-free zone offer a better long-term prospect than pursuing a nuclear-arms race that neither can win. Similarly, Israel's nuclear difference-the ability to threaten to obliterate an attacker-is being eroded by the spread of longer-range missiles and chemical and biological weapons. Israel will still not want to disarm, but it is losing its edge to a mere balance of terror.
Is it unfair to expect other countries to forgo nuclear weapons, unless the five declared nuclear powers give up theirs, too? One answer is that, unfair or not, the technology of the bomb is widely known. As India discovered, going nuclear merely provokes the neighbours. The other is that the NPT is a bargain freely entered into. The nuclear haves promise to work towards disarmament. The have-nots promise not to acquire the weapons, and in return are given help with their civilian nuclear industries. Both sides can gain more if they persist with this bargain than if they abandon it.
The Americans and the Russians have belatedly started to work harder towards disarmament. Cuts announced so far, whether made by treaty or unilaterally will trim pre-1991 war head totals by 60-70%. A lot more could be done. Cutting by half again, to around 2,000 warheads, would make it hard for China, Britain and France to keep their weapons at present levels. Meanwhile Russia needs more help to dispose of its redundant warheads. America's proffered $400m is fine, but the bill runs into billions.
Braver moves could help to put the moral stuffing back into the anti-proliferation cause. One would be a ban on the production of fissile material (coupled with stricter controls on the stuff used in civilian reactors), plus international controls on the uranium and plutonium extracted from dismantled warheads. Much tighter limits can be imposed on the yield and frequency of nuclear tests, even if countries with nuclear weapons are not ready to abandon testing completely.
The strongest argument for bolstering the NPT is often overlooked. Because of it, several countries--from Canada to Germany and Japan--that have the capacity to build the bomb have chosen not to. If they are to remain bombless, they need to know that cheaters will be caught and, if necessary, punished. That means keeping up pressure on Iraq until the frisking job is finished. It also means stopping North Korea. the next-worst offender among the NPT'S renegade states, from building a bomb. Which is why time is so short. If nothing is done, maybe 18 months from now North Korea will be a nuclear power. South Korea, Taiwan and Japan will then be tempted to follow suit. The stakes are high.
The NPT regime needs defending, but the job should not be done by America alone. However determined America may be, it needs the co-operation of the countries that will have to go on making the treaty work. If Iraq's misdeeds were worthy of UN action, so are North Korea's. If diplomatic pressure does not persuade North Korea to conform, then harsher remedies, including military ones, may have to follow. China has most leverage over North Korea and most qualms about direct action. Yet it can do most for the treaty it has just signed by telling North Korea to step back from the nuclear threshold, or expect to be shoved back.
There is no easy way to stop proliferation. Upholding the NPT may involve spine-prickling moments. It is the worst way to guard against Armageddon, except for all the others."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224141728/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/2?accountid=14657,"From budget box to ballot box: the way Britain's election campaign was launched this week leaves no doubt that the economy will dominate the debate between now and April 9th. Norman Lamont's budget provides an obvious opener, but the truth about the economy goes well beyond what any chancellor can do in a speech of 70 minutes. The voters ought to be judging the results of all the Tory budgets since 1979, and the promises that the parties make about the future.
Separating truth from myth will not be easy. Some of the Tories' proudest claims are hollow. Some of Labour's fiercest criticisms are wrong. The Conservatives will be trying to show that John Major is both true to Margaret Thatcher's economic legacy and a welcome break from it. Opposition parties will dwell on the recession--which, conveniently for them, began almost exactly when Mr Major became prime minister. Tories will stress the growth of the 1980s, and the growth to come.
As a guide to the truth, Mr Lamont's budget was useful in two ways. First, as an exercise in macroeconomic management it was more cautious than many had expected (and than this newspaper had feared). Net tax cuts of L1.6 billion ($2.8 billion) are only 0.3% of GDP, and they helped to produce an estimate of the 1992-93 budget deficit that nobody could say was wishfully low (see pages 71-74). But the size of that deficit was the budget's other revelation. At L28 billion (4-1/2% of GDP), it reflects a huge increase in public spending. Between 1990-91 (Mrs Thatcher's last fiscal year in office) and 1992-93, spending is set to grow by no less than 20%, while retail prices rise by only 9%.
The government an fairly claim that part of this spending growth is caused by recession, which boosts thing like unemployment pay. But the bigger truth is that Mrs Thatcher just said no; Mr Major likes to say yes. His spending plans could easily be mistaken for those of a Labour government. Even if economic growth turns as strong as the Treasury expects, public expenditure in 1994-95 will still be 42-1/2% of GDP. That is higher than the annual average during the Labour government of 1964-70, and only a bit less than the 44% that Labour spent in 1978-79, the last time it held power. No wonder the small print of the budget shows no net tax cuts until 1995-96, and then only of L1 billion. Britons who vote Conservative next month will not be voting for lower taxes; the most they can hope for is to avoid the higher taxes that Labour has been honest enough to say it will introduce. And those who vote Labour will not get anything like the public spending that shadow ministers have promised or implied. The money isn't there.
That would be the strongest message of the Completely Honest Party, if only one existed. Its manifesto would go on to say something like this: ""Most of the economic changes since the 1970s have been for the better, but not all. Even the improvements have not gone very far. Unavoidably, therefore, much still has to be done. Almost all of it will involve short-term pain before long-term gain.""
But even an unvarnished message would be able to mention two big pluses. During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, output per worker-hour in Britain rose more slowly than in any other big OECD economy bar America. In the 1980s the British rose from sixth in the big seven's productivity-growth league table to second. The credit for that improvement should go to Mrs Thatcher's economic radicalism. Managers started to manage, which included closing plants and reducing staff. Workers became more flexible and more motivated. Strikes, once an instinctive British reaction to industrial change, turned rarer than they are in Scandinavia.
The other vital plus was that the British economy became better at producing real output and worse at producing inflation. During the 1970s nominal GDP rose by 350%, and was split 93-7 between higher prices and real growth. During the 1980s the overall rise was 137%, but the split was 76-24. There has never been a shortage of demand in Britain. There has been a chronic inability to supply, but it has got less bad.
An improved supply side had many policy features: trade-union reform, lower income taxes, less-distorted corporate tax, less state intervention of all kinds. One result was a welcome boost to investment, and to the productivity of what was invested. You would not guess this from listening to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who berate the government for neglecting investment. In fact, capital spending by business (the bulk of total investment) stayed within a range of 11-13% of GDP throughout 1970-85. Since then it has broken new ground, averaging almost 14-1/2% of GDP. The real returns on that spending have also been stepped up, from a miserable 2-6 in 1975-85 to something like 6-10% in 1985-91.
IN TOUCH, AT LAST, WITH THE WORLD
Both these improvements have brought the performance of British capitalism closer to that of other countries. It is therefore no surprise that Britain has begun to hold its own in world markets. Between 1970 and 1984, Britain's share of world trade in manufactures fell pretty steadily, from 9% to less than 69%. Since 1984 it has actually risen a bit. These changes are not the stuff of pub politics in a four-week campaign, but they have powerful long-term consequences for every Briton. Incomes and jobs, as well as the quality of schools, roads, hospitals--all will benefit from a more competitive, more productive Britain.
In the short term, though, these changes are being overshadowed by another supply-side, microeconomic reform from the Thatcher years, one which had big implications for demand side, macroeconomic management. This was the financial deregulation that began with the abolition of exchange controls in 1979 and ended with virtually no state involvement in the borrowing and lending decisions of companies and individuals. The result was a surge of credit. Between 1981 and 1989, lending by all financial institutions rose by 16% a year, even though profits and wages were rising by an average of only 8 a year. The result, for many, was Micawberish misery.
House prices rose by 90% between 1985 and 1989. Since then, in parts of the country, they have fallen by roughly a quarter. Just as credit freedom fuelled much of the spending of the 1980s, So it is now prompting much of today's caution. A burnt finger economy is not easy to revive. Yet nobody should doubt that financial deregulation has brought many benefits, and will continue to do so. It injects competition into financial services, which used to be one of the most inefficient bits of the British economy. It allows borrowers to borrow more cheaply, and more widely. It gives savers greater choice and higher returns. The fact that financial freedom has been abused by some is no reason to take it away from all. The fault was in the earlier restrictions, not in the freedom that followed.
Then came recession, which poses a vital test for Britain's economic future, and for the election on April 9th. Will the country and its government react to hard times by reaching for soft options? For three post-war decades, the answer would certainly have been yes. Then two things happened. One was Mrs Thatcher, about whom much is known. The other change was, on the face of it, an obscure European technicality called the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM). Against her instincts, it was Mrs Thatcher who put sterling into the ERM in 1990. In doing so, she took out the best insurance policy against any future government slipping back into soft-option land.
It is now much harder for the government to mismanage the economy. The macroeconomic constraint is prominent, and largely understood: Germanic monetary discipline has to be adopted, to maintain sterling's exchange rate against the D-mark. But there is also a powerful microeconomic dimension to ERM membership. It has not received the attention it deserves, especially since it highlights some stark differences between Labour and the other two parties.
Put simply, Britain now needs not merely continental rates of inflation in prices and wages (the macroeconomic element) but also continental rates of productivity growth. Without the latter, wages in Britain would have to rise wen less than those on the continent, or even start falling. If they did not do so--because of trade-union power, for example, or minimum-wage laws--then more and more companies would find their profit margins being squeezed. Firms would shrink or close, and unemployment would rise. Historically, the British have found matching the continent's productivity growth even harder than emulating its inflation rate. Only when the microeconomy's supply-side weaknesses were tackled did productivity growth pick up.
There is still a long way to go to correct all those weaknesses. At a general level, the political parties now seem to understand this: on education, for example, politicians now chant the new three Rs--reform, resources and relevance--as dutifully as any 12-times table. But Labour, long part of this welcome chorus, is apparently unaware that most of its other microeconomic proposals would damage jobs and/or productivity. It favours a national minimum wage. It wants to reverse some of the Tories' trade-union legislation. It promises to raise marginal tax-cumnational-insurance rates for people earning little more than L20,000 ($35,000) a year, which is barely above average earnings for men with full-time jobs. These nostrums sit oddly with Labour's support for ERM membership. Its spokesmen insist that a sterling devaluation is out of the question, but they are just as adamant about the merits of their microeconomic favourites. Actually, the combination would prove disastrous for jobs. Labour berates the Tories for the 9.2% unemployment rate; if it applied macro-restraint and micro-meddling, today's 9.2% would come to seem like a picnic.
GETTING UP OFF THE FLOOR
The plain truth is that Britain still needs a lot more deregulation, competition, opportunity; in short, a lot more economic radicalism. It needs other things too--changes in how public money is spent, constitutional reform, fresh thoughts on foreign policy--and this paper will be writing about them in the weeks before polling day. But the central issue is the economy, and it has little to do with Mr Lamont's budget. What matters is the radical core: will people and companies be left as free as they are in other countries to buy and sell in the marketplace; and (no less crucially) will they take the consequences of that freedom, bad as well as good? If voters flinch from the challenge, then Britain's economy will again be reduced to growing more slowly than others, and that relative seediness will go deeper into every part of British life.
One half of economic radicalism--stand on your own feet--was accepted by a winning number of voters in 1983 and 1987, when the economy was growing. This 1992 election will test the acceptability of the other half of the creed: when the economy is troubled, get up off the floor."

Recession in Japan? The idea is so unthinkable that many westerners do not believe it (if you don't have a market economy, how can you have a recession?), and Japanese are so panicked by it that they were shouting ""crisis"" even when their economy was growing at a rate that would make other governments cry ""miracle"". Yet a recession is indeed what has started in Japan. Output is falling monetary growth has virtually ceased, investment plans are being slashed. This year promises to be the leanest for Japan since 1974, the last time that GNP actually shrank. This is not, however, a signal for panic-despite the fact that many of the pillars of Japan's financial system are rotten through and through (see page 89). That rottenness is exactly why a downturn is needed. The more it is delayed, the greater the eventual damage from a recession that had to come as surely as the tides turn in Tokyo Bay.
In 1987-90 Japan's economy grew too fast for its own long-term good. Real GNP growth of 5% a year was fuelled by rapid monetary growth, interest rates at record lows, a soaring stockmarket and surging property prices. Companies invested as if capital cost nothing. Banks lent as if risks had been abolished. Households cut their savings and borrowed even more heavily, relative to their incomes, than their profligate cousins in America, as if house prices would rise for ever. Securities firms tried to manipulate the financial markets as if to do so was both safe and legal. All those assumptions were wrong, a fact that emerged in January 1990 when the Tokyo stockmarket began its almost 50% fall. It has taken two years for the message of the financial markets to feed through to the real economy: that bills eventually come due. A period of excess tends to be followed by a spell at the health farm--or in hospital.
Thanks to all this, Japan is likely to suffer the same sort of recession that has afflicted America and Britain: a long and dispiriting one. Debts have to be repaid or restructured, financial firms have to adjust to bad debts and other losses, households have to face up to the fact that the houses against which they borrowed are worth perhaps 30% less than a year or two ago. Bankruptcies are already breaking records, with the liabilities of bust firms in 1991 totalling Y8.2 trillion ($63 billion), and could rise by a further 50% this year. Such a downturn will affect even Japan's best, brightest and most famous companies. In the financial year to next March, company profits are expected to fall for the third consecutive year, the first time this has happened since 1945. Sony, the country's best-known electronics firm, is already losing money. It will not be alone.
There is a chance--no more than that, as yet--that Japan's recession could be deep. If the decline in capital investment accelerates, and if falling stock and property prices prompt sharp cuts in bank lending, then activity could slump. Yet there is good reason to be sanguine even about that possibility. Japan is in perfect shape for a recession. It is at full employment, inflation is low (1.8% in the year to January), and the government's budget has a surplus of more than 2% of GNP. As a formula for ensuring that an essential adjustment can be made tolerable, you cannot et better than that.
THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS--AND FISCAL
Japanese politicians are so unaccustomed to recession that some--notably Shin Kanemaru, the powerful back-room fixer of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party--have panicked, demanding cuts in interest rates and threatening to sack Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan. In part, this is pure self-interest, as big donors to the LDP being to suffer. But it is also a throwback to an old Japanese sense of vulnerability: the bicycle theory, that as soon as Japan stops pedalling it will fall over. This is nonsense. Not only can Japan withstand a recession, it will also emerge stronger from it, with a healthier financial system and corporate investment plans based on the true cost of capital, not on a fantasy that money grows on trees. Mr Mieno knows that, which is why he has been reluctant to cut interest rates. He has been following a cardinal rule of central banking: always keep several weapons in reserve.
If and when a response to Japan's recession is needed, monetary policy will not be the best one. When confidence is hit and debts are being dealt with, the demand for money becomes less sensitive to its price. The Bank of Japan's discount rate may well be cut soon, but it will have little effect. A better way will be to use fiscal policy, since the government's budget surplus gives it ample room for manoeuvre. Tax cuts will help to revive domestic demand, with the welcome side-effect of stemming the growth in Japan's current-account surplus by sucking in more imports. Fortunately, fiscal policy also takes time. There is no need to rush."

The luxury was the knowledge that any fighting within the inner Soviet empire would be quickly suppressed, or at least contained. So long as the Kremlin played the policeman, outsiders did not have to bother too much about places like Nagorno-Karabakh. It was the scene of a far-off conflict of which the West knew--and cared-little. None of our business, said western governments, a Soviet ""internal affair"". But Nagorno-Karabakh and other ex-Soviet trouble-spots are rapidly becoming everyone's business.
With the Soviet Union's dissolution, Nagorno-Karabakh instantly became an international conflict, with an alarming potential to spread. It has brought two independent states, Azerbaijan and Armenia, close to war. For the moment the war zone is confined to Nagorno-Karabakh itself, a largely Armenian-inhabited region that wants independence from Azerbaijan. But, as the ex-Soviet army withdraws, the fighting (massacring is often a better description) is getting bloodier, and higher-tech. The hunting rifle is being replaced by the heatseeking missile. The Armenians are said to be getting soldiers and weapons from the Armenian diaspora. And now Azerbaijan is building its own army, drawing on ex-Soviet forces for men, equipment and training. As more lives are lost, militancy grows. Last week nationalists forced the resignation of Ayaz Mutalibov, Azerbaijan's president, for allegedly being too soft on the Armenians.
Other countries are reluctantly being drawn into the argument. Iran has about 15m Azeris and up to 1m Armenians in its population of 57m. It is naturally keen to prevent the conflict spilling over its border. Turkey, a neighbour to Armenia and a close friend of Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan, also wants to avoid any growth in the fighting--and any extension of Iranian influence in the region. Iran and Turkey are two of the trio of old rivals in the Transcaucasus. The third power, Russia, is trying to mediate in the dispute, together with newly independent Kazakhstan: a Christian and a Muslim mediator tiptoeing between Christian Armenia and Muslim Azerbaijan. So an obscure argument in a mountainous ex-Soviet enclave has already dragged in six states, with between them plenty of well-intentioned mediators but also an abundance of nuclear weapons and nationalist fanatics.
Some of the other outlying parts of the former Soviet Union are only slightly less explosive. Georgia's civil war has given the world an excuse for ignoring the place. But it will be harder to ignore now that Edward Shevardnadze, the West's favourite ex-Soviet foreign minister, and ex-boss of Georgia, has returned to lead the country's new ruling council. In Moldavia Russian-speakers in the self-styled ""Dniester Republic"" have been trying to seize arms to defend their effort at independence; they do not want to be part of a Romanian-speaking country, especially if one day Moldavia reunites with Romania itself. This is part of a complex set of territorial disputes involving Moldavia, Romania and Ukraine--names to conjure with in future include northern Bukovina and southern Bessarabia--which, if one thin led to another, could easily end in war.
THE COMMONWEALTH CAN'T COPE
The West has still not quite come to terms with the idea that it has an obligation to help sort out some of these conflicts. It has been hoping that the new Commonwealth of Independent States will keep thing under control. But the Commonwealth has no clout, and may soon collapse altogether. It has usefully provided a mechanism for dismantling the Soviet state, and it can still provide a framework for settling economic differences and negotiating an orderly break-up of the ex-Soviet armed forces (the main item on the agenda for the Commonwealth summit in Kiev on March 20th). But it will not be able to inherit the role of regional policeman. The Ukrainians are too afraid of Russian domination in the Commonwealth to let it play the gendarme.
That leaves a gap the West has to fill. NATO and its new friends from the former Warsaw Pact made a start this week by asking the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to help the Russian-Kazakh mediation effort in Nagorno-Karabakh. But this still means hoping that the Soviet successor-states can arrange a settlement, even as their credibility as peacemakers dwindles with the withdrawal of ex-Soviet troops from the troubled region, and with the splintering of the ex-Soviet army. A lot of lives could be saved in Nagorno-Karabakh and elsewhere if western governments admitted that the Commonwealth is a nonentity, and that they themselves are needed as referees."

On March 9th a select committee of the House of Commons blamed the City's increasingly infamous mix of self-and statutory regulation for pension-fund plundering that has left 30,000 past and present Maxwell employees fearing for their futures. It came up with sweeping proposals for change, most of them welcome.
The first and main proposal is to scrap the old trust-law framework within which corporate pension funds operate, and replace it with a new pensions law. This seemed sensible when Harold Wilson suggested it in 1980, and still does. Trust law presupposes a community of interest between an employer and the beneficiaries of its pension scheme. Yet, as in the wage negotiations of which pensions form a part, these interests differ--on contribution levels, the use of any surplus, and so forth. It offers an employer wide latitude in controlling the fund and members few rights over what is, for most of the 19m Britons who are in such schemes, their second-biggest asset. America, Australia, Canada and Ireland have all incorporated the good bits of trust law (such as the fiduciary duties of trustees) into tailor-made statutes. Britain should do so too.
Such a pensions law, as the House of Commons committee sees it, would improve disclosure; require independent custodian trustees to hold fund assets; and demand more of professional advisers. It would concentrate regulatory responsibility on the Occupational Pensions Board, which now oversees some aspects of some funds. The committee leaves to a future public inquiry the vexed (but vital) question of who owns pension-fund assets, and with it more detailed recommendations about pension-fund representation and powers.
All these proposals are as irrefutable in outline as they will prove controversial in detail. Another recommendation, however, is plain wrong. The committee urges the government to consider slinging a safety net under pensions. To do that would be to ignore the painful lesson of America's banks and thrifts. A compensation scheme is all too likely to encourage trustees and investment managers to error or snooze, and pension-plan members to overlook their errors. This is why another chunk of the report is also dubious: the bit that exhorts the government to consider helping Maxwell pensioners.
LOCKING STABLE DOORS, AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE
There are two ways to help the pensioners, one of which should be pursued. That is to get back as much as possible of the funds' missing L450m ($775m), leaning on lenders that accepted stolen assets as collateral to return them. Legally, banks need not hand anything over unless they knew, or ought to have known, that Maxwell did not have clear title to it. It would be nice to assume that banks learnt a lot about the Maxwell finances before lending more than L1 billion, but perhaps rash. Appeals to moral responsibility are likely to prove even less fruitful (though NatWest has apparently said it may return L20m-worth of Israeli shares). But the British government has other pressure-points. Goldman Sachs, for example, earned millions in fees from lead-managing the second tranche of the British Telecom privatisation in America last year, and a third tranche is in the offing. Goldman Sachs might think it prudent to relinquish some of the assets that it acquired during its relationship with Robert Maxwell, without which the old crook might have felt less able to support the price of his companies' shares and less moved to raid pension funds to pay for it.
This will not be enough. So the other possible way to help pensioners is to use taxpayers' money. It seems inhumane to deny them the comfort that was given to the duped but greedy victims of Barlow Clowes, an investment house that collapsed in 1988. But the government was wrong to give compensation then and would be wrong to do so now. Compensating fraud victims increases tolerance of wrongdoing; it implies an official responsibility that does not and cannot exist; it opens a hornets' nest of inconsistency (should taxpayers compensate victims of burglary, which stricter policing ""might"" have prevented?) The best security for pensioners is to pass a coherent pensions law, and to give its guardian strong powers."

Italy and Japan, alone among rich countries, have political systems uncomplicated by alternating governments. For nearly 40 years the Liberal Democrats have run Japan; for nearly 50 years the Christian Democrats have dominated the coalitions--all 49 of them--that have run Italy. Both countries are democracies, but democracy without a change of government is a bit like Atlanta without a change of aircraft: missing its defining characteristic. Voting loses its point, not to mention its fun, if it never involves kicking the rascals out.
Italians will get the chance to do that on April 5th, and the Japanese will be able to do the next best thing--giving their rulers a good hack on the shins--when they go to the polls for the upper house of their parliament in July. For the first time since the second world war there is real uncertainty in Italy: the political class is expecting to measure the electoral shift reflected by the voting not in the usual millimetres, but in centimetres, maybe even in metres. In Japan he voters are already taking swipes at the government, most recently, on March 8th, by voting for the opposition candidate in a by-election. Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, may lose his job if his party's fortunes do not perk up (see page 36).
No one should assume, however, that the mere unpopularity of the government will be enough to ensure its dismissal in either Italy or Japan. The change that invites speculation about the durability of the status quo in Italy is the collapse of communism. Italy has achieved its faction-ridden, paralysed and consensual political system through the joint terror of a fascist past and of a possibly communist future; democrats have combined against anti-democrats, real or imaginary. Now that the neo-fascists (adorned by Mussolini's grand-daughter) are more decorative than menacing and the communists are divided and demoralised, the anti-democrats scarcely seem worth combining against. The coalition parties like the present arrangement because it enables them to hand out jobs and patronage to their cronies. But the voters are growing weary. Hence the rise of the many protest leaves in northern Italy, and fringe parties all over.
Japan too has a faction-ridden, paralysed and consensual political system, and a wartime past even uglier than Italy's. It also has a main opposition party, the Social Democrats, as unfit for government as the Italian communists. But the Social Democrats' democratic credentials have never been in doubt; only the wisdom of their policies. So the reason Japanese voters may one day decide they need a system of alternating governments has nothing to do with the collapse of communism in Europe. It is that the current system is so dreadfully corrupt.
OF RICE AND YEN
Italy and Japan have in common some pleasant thins (a fondness for rice), some silly thing (currencies that put too many noughts on the end of every bill), some awkward things (elongated territory frequently shaken by earthquakes), some peculiar things (corporate fiefs born of city states and warlords) and some nasty thing (the Mafia and the yakuza). They also have economic systems which, despite their current troubles, have an enviable record of delivering the goods. If they are less influential in the world than their economies suggest they should be, it is because of their common political system, which produces weak governments that are one-party-dominated, consensus-hungry, decision-shy and prone to corruption. Change may not come this year, but the sooner it does the better it will be for Italians and Japanese alike."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224134192/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/7?accountid=14657,"The old national leader privately criticising the new one for ""not standing for anything"": Ronald Reagan on George Bush, or Margaret Thatcher on John Major? The handsome, leftish, would-be national leader suddenly caught up in talk of an old extramarital affair: the Democrats' Bill Clinton or the Liberal Democrats' Paddy Ashdown? Arguments about health-care, anger about recession. In recent months London and Washington have been ringing with echoes from across the water. A new transatlantic politics, or just coincidence?
Echoes like these might merit a quick nod and no more, but for two things. The first is that Britain and America have been on parallel ideological journeys in recent years--enough so to make the notion of a common political culture worth considering. The second reason is more humdrum. More than ever, the two political establishments today swap ideas, maintain friendships and keep at least half an eye on each other's political debate. Ideas, images and ways of thinking are, after all, the most easily exported transatlantic traffic there is.
Do not go overboard, though, in search of parallels. The two countries still have different histories, cultures and political structures. Britain's Labor Party, though it has given up socialism for social democracy, is no sibling of America's Democrats. The Conservatives and Republicans are closer, but still kissing cousins, not brothers. And though British politics is no longer a polite version of the class war, class still matters more. Conversely, in most of Britain regional origin matters less.
Constitutional differences, large in themselves, also profoundly act electoral politicking. America's presidential election comes every four years, Britain's general elections at intervals, chosen by the prime minister of the day, that range from a few months up to (by law) five years. America is electing a president, whose coat-tails may or may not drag some supporters into Congress. Britain is electing its members of Parliament, all of them, and the new prime minister is (usually) simply the man whose party gets most. It also has several minor parties, whose support may be decisive if the big two are neck-and-neck.
America's presidential candidates are chosen largely by the people, in primaries, from short-lists prepared by the media. The two big British parties' leaders are chosen solely (for the Tories) or largely (Labour) by their MPS. President and prime minister alike will head governments, but only the president will be head of state. Presidential candidates must act the part of princes, surrounded by bodyguards and courtiers, heralded by cheers, balloons and rousing tunes. ""Can you imagine him dancing with the queen of England?"" might be a telling question about Mr Clinton; no one bothers to imagine Labour's Neil Kinnock doing it.
Most striking, America's system of primary elections means two long-drawn, parallel battles within each party, followed by a relatively short campaign between the two. Britain's campaign--formally--lasts only a few weeks. But it may be preceded, as it has this time, by a year or more of crossfire, party against party: a campaign in all but name, which cements each party round its champion from the start.
THE CURRENTS OF IDEOLOGY
The discords, in short, areas loud as the echoes. The echoes ring out even so. The most striking ones are ideological, and have been audible for two decades. In Britain and in America, a period of disillusionment with leftish politics in the late 1970s gave way to right-wing, free-marketeering populism under a strong but controversial leader. In both countries, that right-wing tide surged on through the 1980s, provoking much heart-searching and modernisation on the left. In both, the great leader was then followed by a milder character, who seemed to lack the vision of his predecessor, but who was easier to live with.
There have been links between American and British politics ever since the first English traders gathered in a Virginia shack to fix tobacco prices. Labour's Harold Wilson, newly elected prime minister in 1964, tried to sell his administration as a sort of Kennedy-like Camelot-on-Thames. It was quite bogus, but few found it unnatural.
The 1980s brought more than echoes. Mrs Thatcher and Mr Reagan had been aware of one another, ""soul mates"", as Mr Reagan put it, long before they became leaders of their countries. The relationship was a real factor throughout the decade. Similar personal chemistry had linked Churchill and Roosevelt. But the Reagan-Thatcher link was more than chemistry. The two leaders were dealing not just with similar problems--over-government, high taxation, the Soviet threat--but from similar points of view. Neither was a great reader of political history, but both governments were saturated with the same economic and political philosophy, culled from old free-market prophets like Adam Smith and new ones like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman.
The similarities between the ""new right"" think-tanks and institutes in the two capitals, such as Washington's Heritage Foundation and London's Institute of Economic Affairs, were close. Their bright young things criss-crossed the Atlantic, read one anothers' papers, spoke at the same conferences. The director of domestic policy at the Heritage Foundation is Stuart Butler; his brother Eamonn runs the Adam Smith Institute in London. Unsurprisingly, such groups pressed similar policies on their respective governments, often successfully.
President Reagan stood down because the American constitution required it. Mrs Thatcher was (only just) overthrown in a party coup. Yet both nations reacted with a faint sigh of relief, and the two new leaders, though picked by quite different processes, were much alike. Mr Bush and Mr Major are both administrators rather than ideologues. Both disguise a streak of ruthlessness behind an amiable exterior. Both face right-wing sniping and unflattering comparisons with their predecessors. Both now are struggling to explain to their natural supporters why the right-wing verities of the previous decade have left them plunged in recession.
A TOUCHY SUBJECT
The influence of American politics is a touchy subject in Britain. A feeling has been gaining ground that British politics is being coarsened, even corrupted by the importation of American techniques.
One charge is that Britain's politics is becoming more ""presidential"". Not so. America's presidential contest pushes party matters to one side. Britain's battle remains a party battle, even when the personality of the leaders plays a big part. Mrs Thatcher was a big figure. Her personality was bound to be a political issue--though not to the exclusion of policy argument. The difference is constitutional. The Americans are choosing a head of state and of government, who may well face a hostile legislature. Britain's leader--however dominant in his party (usually more so than an American president is in his)--depends on the legislature.
This year in Britain the personality of the party leaders will again matter a lot. Not, though, because of evil ways learnt from across the Atlantic, but because Mr Kinnock is less popular than Mr Major, and the Tories have few other cards to play. Anthony King, a professor at Essex University, argues that ""for personality to matter, two conditions must be met: the election must be close, and the gap between the leaders wide. This year, both are true."" As was true in the days of Gladstone and Disraeli.
A second illusion among some Britons is the notion that muck-raking through politicians' private lives is an American import. It is not. Britain's popular press has little to learn about raking muck. The difference is that the electoral use of this skill is still far short of American practice. Neither country can be proud, maybe (though neither should be too alarmed: Mr Clinton's denial of a long affair may have done him as much harm as the allegation, Mr Ashdown's admission of a short one certainly did his party no harm and perhaps some good).
There is one clear transatlantic contrast: fund-raising. In America, a presidential hopeful raises most of his finance, for the primaries, himself. He is continually begging: at $100-a-plate dinners, over the telephone to 20 people a night who might contribute $1,000, if they can say they have spoken to the candidate. Party money starts rolling--about $50m on each side in 1988--only when the party has picked its man.
In Britain, the party raises virtually all the money for elections, and spends most of it centrally. There is no limit on the size or source of donations, though spending in individual constituencies, once the campaign is formally underway, is tightly limited. The Tories get money with little difficulty from business. Labour's main financiers, the trade unions, are hard up themselves these days; it will be lucky to have a quarter of the L20m that the Tories may spend this time.
In both countries, obviously, money counts. The big difference comes in America's primaries, where the hopeful who runs out of cash is finished. Dollars kept Michael Dukakis afloat in the 1988 primaries, while his penniless Democratic rival, Richard Gephardt, sank. A stuffed wallet has been Mr Clinton's lifesaver this year.
LEARNING THE TECHNIQUES
The broad political waves, though, are indeed moving together in Britain and America. So too are the arts of electoral politics. If Britons want to feel indignant, they may do so about the use of American-inspired techniques. But if that complaint is fair, it could come still more fairly from Americans. It is the technique that matters, not its source.
America has indeed often been the source. Britain's Tories send ""observers"" to the Republican presidential campaigns, and have learnt from Republican polling and advertising techniques. Harvey Thomas, the man who stage-managed Mrs Thatcher's speeches and campaigns (and who had worked on Billy Graham's evangelising tours), went often to Washington to pick up the latest ideas and gadgets. The Conservatives in 1987 spent L1m ($1-3/4m) hiring Richard Wirthlin, Mr Reagan's pollster. Labour last autumn got advice from two Democratic consultants, Robert Shrum and David Doak. Labour politicians regularly attend Democratic conventions, dine with Democratic leaders, and follow Democratic fortunes with more than academic interest.
One simple example of copy-catting is in fund-raising. Both big British parties are now passing the hat in almost American style. Mr Major and his friends have persuaded Hong Kong businessmen to cough up large sums. Both he and the opposition leaders host informal dinners for rich businessmen. Mr Kinnock has held glitzy L500-a-head parties to raise money from theatrical and business backers. British fund-raisers have studied and copied the direct-mail techniques used in America.
Not all the eavesdropping is one-way. When Mr Major had put the finishing touches to his ""citizen's charter""--a flummery of promises which supposedly would give users of public services a better deal--he discussed it with President Bush. Mr Bush then asked his aides to discover whether there was anything in it that could be redesigned for use in his campaign. One Democratic consultant says his party learnt much from regular meetings with Labour's backroom boys about how to paper over divisions between centrists and leftists.
The perils of copying too slavishly were famously brought home to Joseph Biden, a senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988. A political pundit from the American Enterprise Institute, William Schneider, was much impressed with a party political broadcast featuring a speech made by Mr Kinnock, during Britain's 1987 election campaign. It included a line about his being the first Kinnock for ""a thousand generations"" to have the opportunity to go to university. He was right to be impressed: even the Special Branch policeman guarding Mr Kinnock had tears running down his face as the Labour leader spoke. Mr Schneider sent videotapes to several would-be presidential contenders. Mr Biden was a bit too impressed. He got hold of the original speech, learnt part of it and used it; only to be caught out in his borrowing and forced to quit the race.
PERSUASION BY SOUND-BITE
Far more novel--more questionable, some think--than a bit of plagiarism or fancy fund-raising are the techniques of persuasion aimed not at financiers but voters. On both sides of the Atlantic, the politicos have learnt from the advertising industry. They all use private opinion polls and ""focus groups""--small groups of carefully chosen ""typical"" voters, whose reaction to statements and images reveals not only what they think about particular issues, in greater depth than opinion-polling can, but how much they care. The Conservatives, learning from the Republicans, reckon that certain issues, like tax, are good for them almost regardless of what is said. So they are happy, not worried, to see Labour fiercely defending its tax policy; they believe voters will simply register ""tax"" and think ""Labour win tax more"".
American politicians led way--the British have copied them--in realising that an effective political advertisement is not one that seeks to convert voters directly, but one that sparks off debate. That not only means more coverage for the same money. Far more significant, it means setting the electoral agenda.
A famous (or infamous) example was the ""Willie Horton"" commercial that sank Michael Dukakis. Few voters actually saw this commercial, which implied that Mr Dukakis spent his time releasing black murderers on furlough who then committed rape. But it was widely reported. The British parties, which by law cannot use television commercials, instead launch posters with great hullabaloo, not to be seen by passers-by--few copies ever make it to the bill-boards--but to be filmed by news cameras.
TELEVISION POLITICS
Television itself is the most powerful influence making British and American elections alike. No longer, in either place, is much time or money spent on ""retail"" campaigning. Canvassers still knock on doors in Bristol; candidates still chat amiably in kitsch-filled New Hampshire living rooms. Mail shots are sent, leaflets distributed. But these endeavours are increasingly marginal. In both countries today, most of a campaign's time, energy and money is spent on one thing: getting on television.
America has led the way. It got there 20 years ago: by now, but for television few voters would know there was a campaign on. In Britain the 1987 election is reckoned to have been the first real television campaign. That was the election that brought a still-famous ""party political broadcast"" (Britain's substitute for commercials: a number of five-minute or ten-minute slots allocated, for free, to every big party, on the BBC and the main commercial channels). It owed much to Mr Reagan's fixer, Michael Deaver, and the Madison Avenue admen who created an epic film for the 1984. Republican convention, ""Morning Again in America"", featuring dewy-eyed children, amber waves of grain and Ronald and Nancy strolling hand-in-hand through the woods. Labour's communications guru of the time, Peter Mandelson, now a would-be MP, had seen it and others like it. For 1987 he got Hugh (""Chariots of Fire"") Hudson to make a party political that is remembered even today, full of cliffs and sea and swooping gulls, with Neil and Glenys Kinnock hand-in-hand.
Labour still lost. But Mr Mandelson had changed British politics for ever. For this was not all he copied. He went for few, short news conferences; for themes-of-the-week (""crime week"", ""education week""); for colourful, tightly controlled photo opportunities. A year later Mr Bush's men were pushing themes-of-the-day and marching him through flag factories. This year the parties in both countries say orchestration is all. They have learnt the two cardinal rules of campaigning by television: (1) the evening news programmes need pictures, and competition between rival channels means they will take whatever is offered, so long as it is pretty; (2) to the extent they can control these pictures, party campaigners can control the electoral agenda. And all now know that what counts is not reasoned argument but the quotable sound-bite.
The House of Commons' belated (1989) acceptance of television cameras has brought a new influence in Britain, one that America cannot match or copy. ""Prime minister's questions""--a direct clash of the party leaders across the floor of the Commons--makes splendid television. The broadcasters have latched on to it. So have the parties. For months now this twice-weekly event has been staged for the electorate as much as for the legislature.
Broadcasters say they dislike such manipulations. Britain's main commercial news service, ITN, avers that it, not the parties, will set the agenda this time; that only ""real"" news will be covered. Really? American networks made similar noises a 1984 (then came Willie Horton) and 1988 (enter, in 1992, Mr Clinton's friend, Gennifer Flowers). In truth, British broadcasters for the past few months have followed the politicians' lead like sheep, sending the cameras dutifully along as one party unveils a silly poster and then its rival an even sillier one.
In both countries, while the spin-doctors manipulate, the knifemen carve. More sharply in America: even if broadcasting (or libel) law allowed it, Britons would not tolerate things like Patrick Buchanan's commercial that linked Mr Bush to blacks, homosexuals, sado-masochists and child pornographers simultaneously. But the Conservatives have followed the Republicans in the ruthlessness with which they have been combing old cutting and new databases for dirt on opposition MPS. And much British campaigning is negative. Labour's posters show, for example, the Tory health secretary as a surgeon wielding his scalpel on the national health service. The Tories have a policeman with his hands tied and the assertion that ""Labour is soft on crime"" (which has doubled since 1979).
KIN, BUT NOT FAMILY
None of this, though, is just an Anglo-American phenomenon. In many countries--some even in Eastern Europe--the same sorts of things are happening, as television and the techniques of using it advance. Part of a world economy and the western alliance, Britain and America tend to share the same concerns at the same time. Sharing a language and, in part, a culture, the two political establishments are closer than others. Their views on those concerns can sound uncannily alike--though not more so than might the views of Germans or Spaniards, translated into English--and they easily pick up themes, images and political marketing techniques. Yet this does not add up to a transatlantic election. Two different constitutions and electoral systems are operating to select leaders for different jobs. The similarities are eye-catching, and increasing; the distinctions are still wide."

It took a moderate and modern southern Democrat and delivered to him the vote of primaries throughout the south, from the bleached-out bars of Key West to the barrios of El Paso. But that was not all the south did on Super Tuesday. Supposedly the most right-wing region of the country, it snubbed an insurgent conservative challenge and gave itself to George Bush.
The upshot is that, barring scandals or illness, the presidential election in November is almost bound to be between Mr Bush and Bill Clinton. Mr Clinton, the governor of Arkansas, won throughout the south, by far bigger mains than anyone had predicted. His nearest challenger, Paul Tsongas, once a senator from Massachusetts, had hopes of coming close to Mr Clinton--perhaps even of beating him--in Florida, geographically a part of the south but demographically almost a northern state. He was hammered there, with Mr Clinton winning by 52% to 34%. Florida was the state where Pat Buchanan, Mr Bush's challenger, did best, but even there he won only 32% of the vote. His continued presence in the race is now a matter of pride; and of preparing the ground for a presidential campaign in 1996.
Mr Clinton is not on quite such sure ground as Mr Bush. He came third, behind both Mr Tsongas and Jerry Brown, in Massachusetts. He has yet to win much outside his native south and now has to fight two primaries on March 17th in Illinois and Michigan (see box on next page). But his momentum is impressive: if he wins both Great Lakes states, his financial backing and superior organisation are likely to carry him to the Democratic nomination in July.
America will then witness a peculiar contest. For Mr Bush is, at the moment, anything but a popular president; polls show that less than 40% of Americans now approve of his performance. And substantial doubts are held about Mr Clinton's fitness for high office--according to polls, even among one-fifth of those who have voted for him in primaries. As attention begins to shift from the primaries to the general election, are American voters, once again, going to be asked to choose between two men they do not much care for?
The past few weeks have afforded some clues to this depressing prospect. On the Republican side, America has been treated to the spectacle of watching a usually cool president turn, or rather turn bad, into a frantic and unprincipled campaigner, desperate to prop up support on his right flank. Senior administration officials are in something like despair; they do not know whether to take their marching orders from the campaign or from Sam Skinner, the chief of staff in the White House. They are tired of the way in which, based on little more than what focus groups say over doughnuts and coffee, the campaign is making up policy on the hoof. For example, the president has taken to saying that ""welfare reform"" is a matter of central concern to him. That is news to the Department of Health and Human Services, where at least some officials think that the Bush campaign has not the slightest idea what welfare reform means.
Mr Clinton, too, is not running the most seemly of campaigns. Since his comeback from scandal in New Hampshire, he has been anything but the standard-bearer for a new, post-liberal politics that he seemed last year. Instead, he has wanted to reassure ever part of the Democratic constituency that he would protect their interests. Mr Clinton has hammered Mr Tsongas for suggesting that entitlement spending has to be cut if the deficit is to be reduced (which it has) and for suggesting that a petrol tax is a sensible way of encouraging energy conservation (which it is); and he has disavowed an aide who had the temerity to doubt that farm subsidies make economic sense (which they don't).
In Florida, Mr Tsongas called Mr Clinton a ""pander bear"", with some reason; but the criticism would have had more force if Mr Tsongas had not shown himself equally adept at currying support with favours. It is curious how, when in Texas and Oklahoma, he was intellectually persuaded of the need for tax breaks for the oil and natural gas industries.
Matters might go from bad to worse. Assuming that Mr Clinton is the Democratic nominee, it is all but certain that Republicans will attack him for his alleged marital infidelity and draft-dodging, besides raking over certain business deals that Mr Clinton has made in Arkansas. But Mr Clinton, unlike Michael Dukakis in 1988, will fight back. If he is attacked on his business deals, his campaign is quite likely to haul Mr Bush's children's finances into the spotlight: and there is some grubby stuff there. Already, one Democratic consultant (admittedly, not associated with the Clinton campaign) has said on network television that if Mr Clinton is asked the ""Gennifer"" question, Mr Bush should be asked the ""Jennifer"" one; a reference to a senior administration star who has long been a close associate of Mr Bush. In short the rest of the world could easily be treated to a presidential campaign deeper in dirt than any so far witnessed.
The bright side of Super Tuesday, and its single clearest message, is that Mr Buchanan is going nowhere. As if that message had removed a great load from his shoulders, Mr Bush appeared at a press conference the following morning looking more relaxed than he has done for two months. And, at last, he played to his strengths, giving convincing answers on a number of foreign-policy questions, ranging from aid to Russia to the prospects for a North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA).
It now seems possible that, with the shadow of Mr Buchanan lifting, Mr Bush can once more do what he does best--show that the leader of the only superpower has a sense of the role that it must play internationally. As he was talking James Baker, the secretary of state, was in Brussels making one more effort to find common ground with the European Community on ways to conclude the Uruguay round of the GATT. If, despite misgivings among his own officials, Mr Bush also sends Congress a draft NAFTA in the autumn, America will once more see a president who is something other than a panicky bumbler with an eye on the polls.
At the same time, the country could, in Mr Clinton, see the most engaging Democrat the party has put forward since Robert Kennedy. Mr Clinton, for all his faults, remains a candidate who is extraordinarily able to make people love him at first sight. As he rampaged through the south before Super Tuesday, he became more folksy by the hour. His speech lapsed into southern idiom (so-and-so did ""right well""; such-and-such was ""bad wrong""; on the Clinton campaign one does not eat, one has a feedin'). Those who saw it will never forget the governor, in Tampa, sitting with his back against a live-oak tree dripping with Spanish moss, while a gaggle of blue-rinsed grannies hung on his every word.
If, after the Great Lakes primaries, Mr Clinton concentrates again on the message that persuaded so many thoughtful Democrats, America could have a humdinger of an election. If he once more stresses reform of public housing, choice in education and empowerment of the underclass, he would challenge Mr Bush where he is weakest--in imaginative policies to address America's most persistent domestic ills. In this kind of campaign, Mr Bush would then meet Mr Clinton by stressing that he and the Republican establishment were the only people to whom the world could entrust the foreign policy of the sole superpower.
And who would win such a contest? Two pointers, one each way. Mr Clinton may have swept the Democratic vote in the south, but that is a far cry from saying that he would carry the region in a general election. The 30-year migration of southern voters towards the Republicans has not been reversed in a night. On the other hand, if Cuban-Americans in Florida had not voted overwhelmingly for Mr Bush, he would have been seriously embarrassed there. As it was, turnout in Tuesday's primary was down from 1988, with many Republicans who had voted for Mr Bush four years ago sitting on their hands. No less than 19% of those who voted in the Republican primary in Florida told pollsters that they planned to vote Democrat in November. In short, both men must fight every step to the finish.
MOODY MICHIGAN
Four years ago an aide to George Bush called Michigan the ""Beirut of American politics"". Front-runners in the primaries should certainly approach the state's faction-ridden politics with trepidation; sharp economic decline has given Michigan a habit of throwing up odd election results. Last time round, Jesse Jackson won an unexpected victory in the Democratic caucuses and pat Robertson, a television evangelist, ran second to Mr Bush in a bizarre and bellicose contest.
If Bill Clinton's progress to the Democratic nomination is to be slowed down, Paul Tsongas or Jerry Brown will have to throw up a roadblock in Michigan or Illinois--and Michigan looks their best bet. Mr Brown is certainly thinking that way; he arrived in the state the day before Super Tuesday and has already surprised many by obtaining an endorsement from the United Auto Workers at Ypsilanti, the site of a huge car factory that General Motors will close next year. Many union bosses, supporters of Tom Harkin before he bowed out of the race, are urging workers to vote for uncommitted delegates; but that could be risky, for if the group of committed delegates gets less than 15% of the vote, none of them will go to the convention.
Mr Clinton, who makes it clear he considers Illinois the more critical state, has nonetheless lined up two useful endorsements in Michigan: the Michigan Education Association, a large teachers' union, and Ed McNamara, chief executive of Wayne County, the biggest in the state. He has also won support from black ministers in Detroit, where a large turnout, (which is not expected) could give him many of the votes he will need.
Mr Tsongas's main task is to puncture the aura of inevitable victory that Mr Clinton is trying to project. His difficulty is that his core supporter, rich and educated suburbanites so easy to find on the coasts, are relatively thin on the ground in the hard-pressed rustbelt. To win, he must expand his political base.
Complicating matters for the Democrats in Michigan is what the state's ""Reagan Democrats"" will do. Macomb County, for example, in suburban Detroit, is full of white, working-class voters who used to vote Democratic but moved into the Reagan/Bush camp in the 1980s. The Reagan Democrats do not think much of Mr Bush; nor can they now find a Democrat they like."

Easier said than done. Ambitious investments in television and radio have come to grief, leaving the church with angry members, a discredited management and alarmingly depleted coffers.
Christian Science was the brainchild of Mary Baker Eddy, who founded it in 1879 to cater for the anti-Darwinist leanings of Boston's middle class. Its fortunes have been dwindling for decades. The number of Christian Scientists around the world has fallen from a peak of 270,000 in the 1930s to around 150,000 today. The church's central tenet--that illness may be cured not with medicine, but with prayer--has a point. It can also look like dangerous quackery.
Current schisms will make things worse. On March 9th the five-man ""board of directors"" of the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston (which is known as the Mother Church) announced that it will give itself until June 15th to sell the church's cable-television station, Monitor Channel. If no one buys it, the station will close. The board also admitted that it had borrowed extensively from endowment and pension funds to cover the channel's costs. The board's chairman, Harvey Wood, has resigned, a shocking event.
The church draws much of its respectability from the sober news-coverage of its newspaper, the 84-year-old Christian Science Monitor (Motto: ""First the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear""). In the mid-1980s Mr Wood decided to build on the Monitor's reputation by expanding into broadcasting. A weekly radio show, launched in 1984, was followed by a monthly television news programme, a Boston television station and a shortwave radio station. The most ambitious venture of all, launched last May, was Monitor Channel, a 24-hour cable news station designed to rival CNN.
At the same time, managers made changes to the Monitor itself. Despite its reputation, the paper loses money; its estimated costs of $18m a year are partly paid for out of the roughly $95m the church receives from donations, legacies and investments. In 1988, hoping to increase sales and contain costs, its managers took the Monitor downmarket, halving the number of pages, slackening production schedules and introducing colour photographs. Although circulation has climbed as a result (from 132,000 in 1988 to 196,000 last year), prestige has fallen. Its own reporters call it ""USA Yesterday"".
The move from journalism to television always made Scientists uneasy. ""It's terribly worldly,"" says one of them. Now that the cost of the new ventures is being revealed, they are crosser still. The church (which, as a rule, reveals few financial figures) admits it has spent $250m on its television venture over the past five years.
To cover that, it dug deep into its savings (see chart). Most of the money came out of ""unrestricted funds"", which directors can spend as they like. In 1988 these were half the church's total endowment; now they may be exhausted. Recently, directors resorted to taking cash from ""restricted funds"" too. Between 1989 and 1991 the church treasurer, Donald Bowersock, transferred $40m of ""surplus"" capital from the employees' pension fund into unrestricted funds. Last year and this, the board ""borrowed"" another net $46.5m from restricted funds, $41.5m of it from the pension pool. This leaves pensioners with $73.5m. Three years ago, in a letter to pensioners, Mr Bowersock cited $100m as a safe minimum for the fund.
How the church can repay its borrowings is unclear. Judging by similar deals, selling Monitor Channel will raise only around $10m. The channel, running up losses of $4m a month, needs to increase the number of its subscribers from 4m to 25m before it starts breaking even.
Another expected lifeline, a $97m bequest, may not materialise either. A condition of the bequest was that the church should publish as ""authorised material"" a book written 40 years ago by Bliss Knapp, the legator's husband, and distribute it through ""substantially all"" Christian Science reading rooms. But the book gives Mrs Eddy equal authority to Christ, which Mrs Eddy would never have allowed; and many congregations refuse to stock it. Accordingly, courts may decide that the residuary legatees, Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum, should get the money instead.
This week's financial revelations may mean that the Church of Christ, Scientist misses out on some future legacies, too. ""There is such disillusionment among Christian Scientists that they are looking round for other ways to leave their money,"" says one. A clean sweep of the existing management may be needed. Since the board of directors is self-perpetuating, this cannot be done by ordinary procedural means. Some members say they are relying on prayer."

Most people feel that way. But courts need written guidelines, and there are signs that America's definition of pornography may be about to change.
Under American law, material is obscene when it lacks artistic, political or scientific value and appeals to a ""prurient"" interest. Obscene books or films receive no protection under the First Amendment, which guarantees free speech. Material that is merely ""indecent"" is, however, protected. Pornography occupies a particular niche in this debate. It is now being argued in some quarters that, because its objects are usually women, it can be separated from general arguments about free speech. Pornography, the argument runs, does women harm, encouraging men to attack them; in which case, it is an affront to their claim to protection under the law. It does not matter what kind of ""speech"" pornography can be claimed to be; if its results are violence and degradation, women should be able to sue its makers and distributors in court.
Attempts to define pornography in this way have been made before, and have failed. In the 1980s Catherine MacKinnon, now a feminist professor of law at the University of Michigan, drafted an ordinance in Minneapolis that allowed a woman to sue if she could prove that pornography had harmed her. That ordinance defined pornography as ""graphic sexually explicit subordination of women"". Yet it drew fire both from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which felt it involved censorship, and from the mainstream women's movement, for ""reinforcing sexist stereotypes"" of dominated women. No court accepted the ordinance, and no city has introduced it. The argument that pornography causes harm has made most headway in Canada. On February 27th the Canadian supreme court unanimously redefined obscenity as ""sexually explicit material that involves violence or degradation"". Since, in the court's view, it was degrading mainly to women, the court tested Canada's obscenity laws against the sexual-equality provisions of the national Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It found that, in the case at hand, the affront to sexual equality was greater than the risk to free speech.
American women do not have the constitutional guarantee of equality that was essential in the Canadian case. Nonetheless, Ms MacKinnon, who advised a women's group in the Canadian case, has also worked with conservative lawmakers in Washington to link pornography to sexual abuse. Mitch McConnell, a Republican senator from Kentucky, has sponsored a bill that would allow victims of violent sex crimes to sue pornographers if a jury is convinced that their material influenced the criminal.
The ACLU argues that this ""scapegoats literature"", blaming pornography for social evils it may well have nothing to do with. Video dealers and book publishers have also come out against it, and the split within the women's movement remains deep. If passed, the bill would radically change the law. Sometimes, at least, courts would no longer ask themselves if material said to be obscene was ""patently offensive"". Instead, as courts in Canada now must, they would ask themselves: ""Does it harm women?"" In practice, it may be no easier to prove the case one way or the other."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224161384/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/11?accountid=14657,"""Winning, my friends, isn't everything,""--Patrick Buchanan is fond of the gritty pearls from Vince Lombardi's locker-room--""It's the only thing."" Take Mr Buchanan literally, and you risk mistaking the nature of his crusade.
Consider instead, the candidate's frenzied wanderings through the south once New Hampshire's disgruntled Republicans had sent him away with 37% of the primary vote. He first paid respects to two of his great-great-grandfathers, slave-owners who fought in the civil war. Then he was seen in San Antonio, dramatically brandishing a sword by the Alamo, commemorating the anniversary of its fall. A day later he was in Biloxi, Mississippi, where Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, came home to die.
Many who followed these politically incorrect wandering from the salons of the east coast were shocked. Were there not blacks called Buchanan buried in the graveyard opposite his great-great-grandfather, but ignored by the candidate? Was not his visit to the Alamo an affront to the Latino majority of San Antonio? And was not a visit to Davis's home, Beauvoir, an insult to all blacks?
Not really. Mr Buchanan's Alamo was a laughingly multicultural event, with Texan cowboys rubbing shoulders with a mariachi band and a Highland bagpiper. Unlike the nervous white trustees of Beauvoir, three black churchmen had come to check out Mr Buchanan rather than fret about the symbolism of his campaign. You would never see that at one of David Duke's gatherings.
Mr Buchanan is not a gut racist; like the Bush campaign in 1988, he is using race for cynical, tactical purposes. Since 1964 no Republican presidential contender has been able to win more than 10% of the black vote. Mr Buchanan has therefore chosen, as he put it, to fall back on ""the Barry Goldwater routine, and go hunting where the ducks are."" Hunting ducks, ahead of the Super Tuesday primary on March 10th, meant television advertisements suggesting that blacks, with the help of the latest civil-rights law on quotas, would steal jobs from whites.
MR BUCHANAN IS SHOCKED
The core of Mr Buchanan's message does not lie in race-baiting, however. As his campaign has gathered pace, his fixations have hardened in a way that few of his acquaintances back in Washington could have predicted. Everywhere he has toured--and do not forget that Mr Buchanan, born and raised in the capital, has led a sheltered life--he has ground evidence of, perish the thought, change. So he now wants to marshall the power of the state to shoe-horn America back into the mould of its mythical past. His pre-lapsarian myth is set principally in the olden 1950s of his childhood, but when the need arises it reaches back to other golden eras: the isolationism of the 1930s, or the vigour of the robber barons' billion-dollar country.
Wherever he goes, Mr Buchanan is shocked at change. ""We're not building ships anymore,"" he says despairingly in Gulfport, Mississippi. ""Maybe it's forever, I don't know."" If Mr Buchanan had his way, he would give as many tax credits as it would take to have the hammers ringing out again in America's merchant shipyards. He will not entertain the notion that the country's resources might, in this modern age, be put to better use building computer-driven machine tools than tramp-steamers.
Though he has not voiced them openly, Mr Buchanan has greater ideas still for the nationalist state than merely dishing out credits to any industry (oil and as, aerospace, textiles, shipbuilding) that suffers from foreign competition. For instance, he privately admits he is tempted by the idea of paying for those credits--and much more--by throwing up a wall of tariffs around the American economy. That may not have harmed the country in the length century, when Britain was prepared to pour investment capital into America. It would cripple America in the late 20th century. But Mr Buchanan, by his own account, is no economist; nor is economics, as he says in his autobiography, a science that sends men to the barricades. He expects Americans to be ""citizens before they are consumers"".
Back in Washington, Mr Buchanan seemed to have a conservative's traditional scepticism of government and a reticence about using its powers. Now he sees the state as an instrument of change--and suppression. Describing Mr Buchanan as bordering on fascism no longer looks outlandish--but more because of fascism's corporatist economics than its racism. This is one reason why Mr Buchanan is not, as he claims to be, the heir to Mr Reagan's conservative mantle. Another is his view of America's role in the world now that communism has been beaten back. He thinks that America's sovereignty is somehow under threat from ""globalist"" institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank and the GATT.
Mr Buchanan expects to be defeated at the polls (and defeat following Super Tuesday may be swifter than he thought). For such a champion of lost causes, though, that is not the point. He imagines that his campaign will have captured the high round of the Republican Party. He thinks he needs to stand fully behind George Bush after the party convention this summer, so as to be well placed for the 1996 convention. This assumes that by the summer he will be in the Republican mainstream. That assumption may be false. Mr Buchanan's nativism and his isolationism are so far even from what conservatives in the party now stand for that he is, in the words of Newt Gingrich, a leading conservative in Congress, ""close to becoming unacceptable""."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224131337/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/12?accountid=14657,"The man known as the Ox used to be the subject of grim humour among the mujahideen guerrillas fighting the government. When they got to Kabul, they said, the Ox would be tethered and led out to be slaughtered. That pleasantry is heard less often now. If there is any reason to compare President Najibullah to an ox--apart from his muscular bearing and thick skin--it is because he seems to be for the moment unshiftable.
Much of the discussion about when, or if, Afghanistan will become a peaceful and united country, turns on the future of Mr Najibullah. Can he be turned out? Will he go voluntarily? Benon Sevan, a United Nations official who is trying to coax together Afghanistan's warring factions, believes that Mr Najibullah will simply vanish; perhaps get on an aircraft and be heard of no more, at least in Afghanistan. But Mr Sevan is one of those indefatigable people, peculiar to the UN, who are confident that any problem will yield to tireless optimism. Their hero is Diego Cordovez, whose six years of negotiation led to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But Mr Najibullah did not pull out in company with the men who put him in charge of Afghanistan, and nearly four years later says he sees no reason to go now. Quite the contrary, he sees himself and his followers as ""the forces of reconciliation"". If it would bring peace to Afghanistan, he says, he would sacrifice ""not only my position, but my life."" But then, he asks, what would happen if there were no forces of reconciliation during a transition to a more broad-based government? ""The peace process would fall into the hands of the extremists.""
The idea of Mr Najibullah as the key to peace, reluctantly holding on to power only to keep the extremists at bay, is difficult to swallow. Yet in the cosy surroundings of the conference room where he receives foreign visitors he puts on a performance of impressive sincerity. He speaks in Persian, using a down-to-earth vocabulary. This correspondent also speaks Persian, but Mr Najibullah courteously provided a translator who, perhaps out of awe of his boss, rendered the talk into rather flowery English.
The extremists, Mr Najibullah says, are the Islamic fundamentalists. He regards himself as a good Muslim, but not an extremist. In Kabul and other cities controlled by the government, western ways and modes of dress are tolerated. Mr Najibullah says that, if Afghanistan falls into the hands of the fundamentalists, it will become a centre of terrorism directed at non-Islamic countries. In the ex-Soviet Union, he says, are 30,000 nuclear warheads ""on the loose"". If the fundamentalists get hold of the bomb, the West will have to fight the crusades all over again, ""with nuclear weapons"".
Then there are drugs. Afghanistan has replaced Myanmar as the leading producer of illegal opium, almost all of which is grown in guerrilla-held areas. If the fundamentalists came to power, the supply would be ""multiplied"".
Mr Najibullah thus hopes that America and other countries that once supported the mujahideen are content to see him stay. He is also confident of support from the Central Asian republics that were once part of the Soviet Union. Communist bureaucrats are still in place in much of Central Asia and do not want a change of government in Kabul. Fuel prices dropped 30% this winter as supplies from the northern neighbours reached Kabul.
With the mujahideen factions quarrelling among themselves and, if Mr Najibullah is to be believed, outsiders content with his rule, what does he have to worry about? Probably quite a lot. The most dangerous threats come from within the gates.
In January Afghan soldiers stationed in Hairatan, on the old Soviet border, mounted some kind of rebellion. The details are few, but their grievance appeared to be against their commander, Colonel-General Jomo Asek, a close friend of Mr Najibullah. The soldiers and the local militia that support the government are Uzbeks and Tajiks. The general is a Pashtun. Mr Najibullah recalled him to Kabul. But on March 10th it was reported that the general had returned to his headquarters at Mazari-Sharif. Mr Najibullah clearly believes that he can keep control of the ethnic tension in the north, but he had a nasty moment with the threat of a civil war within a civil war, and one that would cut his supply line from the north.
In Kabul the president appears to be generally disliked, not so much for political reasons, but because he is blamed for high prices. Even though fuel is cheaper than it was, it is still a luxury. Homes and offices are cold. The bazaars are full of food that most Kabulis cannot afford. Aid officials believe that Afghanistan harvested a surplus of wheat last year. But the mujahideen control much of the countryside and stop a lot of the wheat getting to the towns. Food is imported from the ex-Soviet Union but is slow to arrive.
On the other hand, every Kabuli fears what might happen if the mujahideen captured the capital. In March last year Khost, 240 kilometres (150 miles) from Kabul, was taken by the guerrillas who, for once, abandoned their tribal rivalries and organised a concerted attack on the town. Just about everything movable was looted, from equipment in the radio station to beds and surgical equipment in the hospital.
It is difficult to say whether Mr Najibullah, who would make a good poker player, is genuinely strong or whether he is doing his best with a weak hand. Even if, as Mr Sevan hopes, he will vanish, it seems unlikely that he is planning to vanish in time for the ""Afghan gathering"" that the UN man wants to take place in Geneva this month or in April. The idea is that this would lead to a transitional government and a general election. Even moderates in the mujahideen would not join a transitional government that included Mr Najibullah, although some of his lieutenants might be acceptable. But the reality is that it is a rare leader who gives up power voluntarily, and Mr Najibullah does not yet look like that rarity."

They fear that P.V. Narasimha Rao's minority Congress government will not be able to push through his programme. They need to think again now that Mr Rao has won a decisive victory in a parliamentary motion on his economic reforms.
The main opposition groups waited until after the government's budget on February 29th to launch their first full-scale assault on Mr Rao. They failed badly--by 38 votes. (The majority was first announced as 52, but the ancient machine used for counting turned out to be faulty). After the vote, on March 9th, the opposition leader, L.K. Advani, of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), declared that Mr Rao's minority government clearly had a working majority. This is good news for foreign creditors and investors as well as for Indians. Political stability is essential for economic reform.
The BJP refused to support left-wing motions claiming that India had lost sovereignty by accepting humiliating conditions attached to loans from the World Bank and IMF. The BJP supports deregulation and a bigger role for private industry. It opposes the wooing of multinationals, preferring to take the route followed by Japan and South Korea. But there is enough common ground between the ruling and chief opposition parties to make the general thrust of reforms look irreversible.
Mr Rao is one to seven votes short of an absolute majority, depending on which small parties are regarded as reliable allies. The fact that he won so well on March 9th highlights the disarray among some of his opponents. For example, the Telegu Desam, a regional party of Andhra Pradesh, is supposedly a partner of the opposition's Janata Dal. But since Mr Rao himself comes from Andhra Pradesh, this party has never been keen on opposing him.
Mr Rao has kept various cabinet posts vacant as bait for defectors, among them the industry portfolio, and he may soon get a nibble or two. He does not feel comfortable depending on several tiny groups that want special favours and could abandon him at crucial moments. His big advantage at present is that nobody wants a general election so soon after last year's June election, but this asset will diminish with time. He has declared that he will continue with his consensual approach to politics, consulting the BJP and others, even if he garners an absolute majority through defections. This is in striking contrast to the abrasive style of the Gandhi family who ran the party until last year, and goes down well.
A notable side-effect of the parliamentary vote is that dissension within Congress has been quelled. Many in the ruling party are disturbed by the new turn of policy, with its pain of IMF-decreed austerity. They are unimpressed by Mr Rao's claims that he is implementing Nehru-type socialism by other means. Some had wanted to sacrifice the finance minister, Manmohan Singh. But as soon as the opposition started its assault, Congress closed ranks. Having won a big victory, the party will not seek a change of generals in the near future."

Inflation is below 2%, unemployment is a touch over 2%, and the economy is officially expected to grow by 2.6% this year. Yet that forecast looks wobbly, and it compares sadly with growth last year of an estimated 4.3%. Exit polls at Miyagi, where the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was defeated in a by-election on March 8th, showed that voters were disturbed not just by the political scandals shaking the government. They were equally worried about the state of the economy--and the government's seeming failure to do anything about it.
People are concerned about their summer bonuses, usually worth around 2-1/2 months' pay. Pay deals this spring are going to be lower than normal, and many Japanese are worried that there may not be enough money in their bonuses to meet bills for health and education.
The government is worried that the voters are worried. An election for half the seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) takes place on July 26th, just after employers hand out the summer bonuses. The Liberal Democrats currently hold 75 of the 126 upper-house seats due to be contested, and had hoped to regain the majority they had until 1989, or at least hold on to what they now have. Party officials are now gloomily predicting that the best they can expect is to retain 60 seats. That would increase the opposition's upper-house majority from 14 to 29--allowing it to bring parliamentary business to a halt should it wish to do so.
The party that has ruled Japan since the mid-1950s is having to get used to defeat. Its candidate was trounced in a by-election in Nara last month. It lost the Miyagi seat three years ago in the wake of the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal. Until then it was a Liberal Democratic stronghold. In this week's contest, the party mustered all its political and financial weight in an effort to win Miyagi back. More than 300 of its Diet members were sent to the constituency.
The party's candidate, Nobuo Onodera, is a leading local politician and a former chairman of the prefectural assembly. The candidate backed by Rengo-no-kai, Japan's biggest federation of trade unions, was a little-known college professor, Koki Hagino, who had decided to stand only ten days before the start of the campaign. The Liberal Democrat was only narrowly beaten, but what unnerved the party's local workers was the realisation that, had the central office not mounted such a heavyweight campaign, the rout would have been as devastating as it was in Nara.
Two more by-elections are due--in Gunma on March 29th and in Ibaraki on April 12th. Then, on to the July campaign, in which the issues are likely to be those that were prominent in Miyagi, namely scandals and the economy. The Reno candidate there never missed a chance to criticise the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, and his government for failing to explain their involvement in the latest pair of political scandals.
In one, Fumio Abe, a close aide of Mr Miyazawa and a former cabinet minister, is accused of receiving Y90m ($680,000) for helping a steel-frame company called Kyowa win building contracts. In the other affair, some 130 Diet members--including several bigwigs from the ruling party--are said to have been in the pocket of a trucking firm, Sagawa Kyubin, and its gangster friends. The Sagawa affair is still being investigated by the Tokyo public prosecutor's office. When all the details come out, the case is expected to eclipse even the Recruit scandal in terms of the sums involved and the reputations destroyed.
The opposition parties are not as clean as they make out. But at least they have been moving swiftly to stamp out corruption within their own houses. On March 10th the Social Democrats forced one of their lower-house members, Kenichi Ueno, to resign his seat in the Diet. Mr Ueno is alleged to have received around Y10m in handouts from a developer called Mariya.
As for the economy, Mr Miyazawa wants to rustle up some extra money to pour into public works, to get things moving. The quarterly survey of business confidence by the Bank of Japan on March 6th was the gloomiest since the doom-laden days after the stockmarket crash of 1987. Everyone is expecting a further cut in the discount rate, probably before the month is out.
The Liberal Democrats, in particular, have been badgering the bank's governor, Yasushi Mieno, to cut the interest rate. A veiled threat came from Shin Kanemaru, the Liberal Democrats' godfather, who implied that the governor's job was a political appointment. The independently minded Mr Mieno snapped back that cutting interest rates was none of the government's business. By continuing to demand a reduction in the discount rate, the party is out to win credit for the cut that will come when Mr Mieno decides the time is right. That is a measure of how desperate Mr Miyazawa and his government have become."

Campaigning has started for the by-election in Wills, in suburban Melbourne, for the seat vacated by Bob Hawke, the former prime minister who has left Parliament to become a television star. On the first day of the campaign the Labor man who hopes to succeed Mr Hawke was filmed running away from a group of reporters. He said no one had told him that a press conference had been arranged.
The opposition Liberal (conservative) candidate fluffed his opening salvo too. He had told his party that the factory he owns, which makes lambswool dusters, was in the Wills constituency. He has now admitted that it is not, and has offered to stand down. However, everyone knows that the real battle for the seat is not between these two reluctant celebrities, but between Labor's new prime minister, Paul Keating, and the opposition leader, John Hewson.
Labor has been deeply unpopular for two years, because of the recession and the distraction of a leadership feud in which Mr Hawke was eventually defeated by Mr Keating. The economy is showing faint signs of recovery, and Mr Keating is finding his stride and lifting Labor's hopes. His economic statement on February 26th, with tax concessions for investors and more spending on public works, has been well received. Many Australians agree with his remarks--made during Queen Elizabeth's visit last month--about Australia's diminishing affection for its links with Britain.
As a result, Labor is doing better in the opinion polls. Back in December Labor was trailing the Liberal-National opposition by 18 points. A poll on March 9th put Labor 10.5 points behind the opposition. Mr Keating's standing has improved to 37% (up from 25%), compared with Mr Hewson's 46% (down from 62%). So does Labor have a chance of holding Wills on May 11th?
Wills, in a working-class area, would normally be a safe Labor seat. The opposition needs an 8% swing to take it. But this is not unheard of in a by-election defended by an unpopular government.
Mr Keating and Mr Hewson are treating it as a life-or-death struggle. In some ways the two rivals resemble each other. Both come from working-class families. Mr Hewson's father was a fitter and turner, Mr Keating's a boilermaker who set up his own small engineering business. The Keating family was Irish Catholic, the Hewsons were strict Baptists. Mr Keating left school at 14, taught himself economics and became treasurer (finance minister) in the Hawke government. Mr Hewson was an economics professor before entering politics.
It is their temperaments that are noticeably different. Mr Keating is a confident and fiery debater. Mr Hewson is dour and a bit shy, but through diligent effort has become a forceful extempore speaker. Mr Keating says Mr Hewson is a traitor to his class; Mr Hewson says Mr Keating is a con-man. One way or another their political battle is fiercer and more evenly matched than any that Australia has seen for years, and it will get fiercer with the approach of the general election, due by mid-1993.
One other personality could enliven the Wills by-election. A popular local footballer, Phil Cleary, may stand as a left-wing independent: If he were to win, which is possible, the result would humiliate both Mr Keating and Mr Hewson."

The replacement of the Soviet Union by the Commonwealth of Independent States has scared the world. A disintegrating nuclear-armed superpower is a nightmare.
Concern has focused on the ex-Soviet Union's nuclear weapons--about 27,000 of them, from artillery shells to warheads on missiles. Military officials claim that tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from all former Soviet republics, except Ukraine and Belorussia. The remainder should be back in Russia by July. Dismantling them will cost several billions of dollars; America has offered $400m.
Strategic weapons are another matter. Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belorussia have such weapons on their territory. All say they will give them up. Getting rid of nuclear weapons is a condition for getting out of the Commonwealth, and Ukraine is desperate to leave. Kazakhstan might be tempted to keep some, but its ss-18 missiles are under Russian control and their liquid fuel makes them difficult to maintain.
Like the United States, the Soviet Union built a vast industry to support its nuclear arsenal, including stockpiles of fissile material, laboratories, test sites, components factories, assembly plants, transport and storage facilities. Some 700,000 people work in the once-closed cities of the nuclear-weapons industry, although perhaps only 2,000-3,000 have access to the most sensitive secrets. Elaborate schemes are being concocted with western cash to provide new work, and thus to preserve scientists from temptation by secret bomb-builders, such as Libya and Iran.
Then there is the problem of what to do with the 100-150 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, and the 500-700 tonnes of highly enriched uranium (some of it now in weapons), thought to have been produced by the Soviet nuclear-weapons industry over the past 40 years. Both are valuable commodities. A small amount of uranium (probably ex-Soviet, and unsuitable for a weapon) was discovered recently in the boot of a car in Germany.
In the past the Soviet Union accounted for about half the world's uranium reserves (chiefly in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) and 20-25% of its enrichment and reprocessing capacity (all of it in Russia, see map on next page). Nuclear weapons-making was concentrated at a w sites, mostly in the Russian republic. Close-down and clean-up operations present horrendous problems.
Among the most difficult sites are: the huge reactor complex at Chelyabinsk-40, in the southern Urals just east of Kyshtym, where plutonium for the first Soviet atomic bomb was produced; the Siberian atomic* power station, north-west of the city of Tomsk, which also produced plutonium; and Dodonovo, a conglomeration of reactors and chemical plants on the Yenisey river in western Siberia. Of the 14 reactors at these three sites in 1987, producing plutonium and tritium for weapons-making, seven have been closed. Others will follow.
LETHAL POLLUTION
In addition, there are thought to be two main nuclear-weapons design laboratories (similar to America's Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories), one at Sarova, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south-west of Nizhny Novgorod (formerly Gorky) and the other at Chelyabinsk-70, east of the Urals, just north of Kasli. Warheads were built at Nizhnaya Tura, north of Sverdlovsk, and possibly also at Chelyabinsk and Novosibirsk. Until both sites were closed as a result of protests by environmental groups, Soviet nuclear tests were carried out at Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic, and at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.
The accident at the Chernobyl civilian nuclear-power plant in Ukraine alerted the world to the poor standards of Soviet civilian reactors. Its weapons industry is scarcely better. Radioactive waste has been systematically pumped into rivers and lakes. According to a survey in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist (May 1991), Karachay Lake, near Chelyabinsk-40, has accumulated 120m curies of caesium-137 and strontium-90.
In 1989 Professor Alexei Yablokov, a Soviet biologist, claimed that 20% of the Soviet population lived in what he called ""ecological disaster zones"", and another 35-40% in badly polluted areas. In December 1991 Russia's new environment minister confirmed that much of the damage had been done by the weapons industry.
Earlier this year officials in Murmansk, home of the ex-Soviet Northern Fleet, suspended all unloading of nuclear fuel from decommissioned ships, after flagrant violations of safety regulations by the navy. For 20 years nuclear waste, including the damaged reactor core from a nuclear-powered ice-breaker, has been dumped in the Barents and Kara Seas, off Russia's northern coast. Russia has no programme for coping with the damage, or for storing nuclear waste more safely in future."

SECOND-HAND BANGS FOR FEWER BUCKS
If it could be done, would stealing or buying ex-Soviet nuclear weapons be an easier way to become a nuclear power than building your own from scratch? Maybe, but the job would still be tough.
It would be extremely hard to make the things go off as they are. Most weapons, Russian or western, include devices that make it impossible to put the fusing train together without using a secret code. Bombs are a bit like Humpty-Dumpty: any attempt to take one to bits to bypass this safety-catch would probably wreck it beyond repair.
A more promising use for bootlegged bombs would be to extract their nuclear cores, for use in home-made weapons. Workable designs have been known for years. The hard part of bomb-building is to get together enough nuclear material, meaning plutonium or highly enriched uranium. But cutting a weapon apart could be a harrowing adventure.
Any bomb uses a trigger of several pounds of high explosive, which could provide a careless man with a hacksaw with an uplifting experience. The core material itself is extremely dangerous. Uranium gives off nasty radiation; plutonium is about the most poisonous substance on earth. Whichever is inside (it could be both) will probably be in a lump not far short of the critical size at which it could start a self-sustaining chain reaction. Machining, hammering or heating could set off a deadly reaction short of the Big Bang.
Some messing about would be necessary. Nuclear cores are designed for specific weapons, and unless the new owner can build his bomb to nearly the same specification as the original--and few could match Russian designs--he will need his nuclear lumps in different shapes and sizes. Nuclear cores are usually coated with exotic materials; these would have to be peeled off before reshaping. If all this could be done without blowing up the shop, a budding bomb-maker would need about two Russian bombs to make one of his own."

Its undeclared nuclear arsenal, put by outsiders anywhere between 60 and 300 warheads, is thought to have dissuaded the Iraqis from using chemical weapons in last year's Scud bombardment of Israeli cities. But Israel's nuclear: monopoly is threatened from opposite directions: from potential enemies who want to go nuclear too, and from George Bush, who has made eliminating such weapons one of his chief aims for the post-war Middle East.
Although the United Nations suspects that Iraq may still be hiding an underground reactor and some enriched uranium, much of the Iraqi programme has clearly been destroyed. Attention is now switching to Iran and Algeria.
In 1984 China helped Iran build a nuclear-research centre at Isfahan. A Chinese research reactor may follow. China has also sent Iran one calutron, a tiny version of the machines the Iraqis secretly put to work enriching uranium. There are persistent reports of Chinese and Pakistani experts setting up uranium-enriching centrifuges at Moallem Kalayeh, north of Tehran, although inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency found nothing there in February. Iran has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT): it hopes to buy--from India, China or both--""a few"" legitimate civil reactors soon.
For Algeria, the Chinese are building a large research reactor at Ain Oussera. This looks fishy. The Algerians kept it secret until it was spotted by satellites. They then said it had a capacity of only 15 megawatts (powerful enough to produce the plutonium for one bomb a year). The satellite photographs made it look at least twice as big, The Algerians, who have not signed the NPT, agreed to ad hoc inspections by the IAEA, whose people prowled around the reactor twice in January and found nothing to contradict the Algerian claims. A full inspection has yet to come. Rumours that the Algerians plan a reprocessing plant near the site would, if confirmed, set off a new panic.
The Iranians and Algerians naturally deny trying to build a bomb. After the Iraqi experience they are naturally disbelieved. But even if either is lying, both are considered at least five and maybe ten years away from building their own bombs. Unless a Middle Eastern country buys a nuclear weapon off the shelf, Israel's monopoly is probably secure for the time being.
The other threat to Israel's monopoly--Mr Bush's arms-control plan for the Middle East--also looks remote. Last May the president called for a ban on the production and acquisition of bomb-grade fuel, to be followed later by the creation of a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region. Under this plan Israel would close its Dimona reactor, keeping the weapons it has. In return for the capping of Israel's arsenal the Arabs would give up their right to produce nuclear fuel. Israel would eventually disarm altogether.
This idea got short shrift. The Arabs said it would preserve the Israeli advantage. The Israelis said they might welcome a nuclear-free zone, but only as part of a wider agreement. Israel self-servingly defines weapons of mass destruction as ""all weapons capable of killing many people indiscriminately"". It says it will talk about nuclear, chemical and conventional weapons simultaneously, but not solely about the nuclear bombs that it alone possesses. The debate is now tangled in the Arab-Israeli peace talks, which could ramble on for years."

Not so North Korea, India and Pakistan, the three Asian upstarts at the door.
China exploded its first atomic bomb in 1964, a year before the turmoil of the cultural revolution. Its first hydrogen bomb, in 1967, came during the cultural revolution's full chaos. Yet despite China's instability, its bomb alarmed few Asians. It was intended mainly to counter the Soviet Union rather than India, with which China had fought a border war in 1962. It never seemed likely that hot-heads would get their fingers on China's nuclear trigger.
North Korea is a scarier proposition. Russia, China, Japan and the United States all have interests in the Korean peninsula. The balance between them is now roughly stable. If North Korea got the bomb, it would threaten Japan as much as the South. The Japanese are, for nuclear-energy purposes, now amassing the world's largest stockpile of plutonium. If threatened, they could well use it for weapons. A nuclear Japan would make all Asia jumpy.
North Korea is the world's most secretive and rigid regime. It may be beginning to starve, and is certainly facing an internal power struggle. Kim Il Sun, the North's 79-year-old communist dictator, wants his son, Kim Jong Il, to succeed him. Kim the younger is said to be loathed in the party and army. A bomb in his hands, or being tossed around while he and his rivals fought for power, would scare everybody witless.
Since last autumn America has sought to enlist Japan and China to press the North to comply with the NPT, sign a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and open its facilities for inspection. The most troubling site is at Yongbyon, 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of the capital, Pyongyang. The Americans think the North produces weapons-grade plutonium in a research reactor there.
Seeking to cajole the North into concessions, the Americans withdrew all their own nuclear weapons from South Korea late in 1991. North and South Korea did reach an agreement committing them to a nuclear-free Korea. The North signed an IAEA safeguards agreement in January, and says its parliament will rubber-stamp this in April. But it has stalled on international inspections, and this week again rejected the South's demand for mutual inspections.
A dispute broke into the papers this week between America's CIA, which counts the time to a Northern bomb in months, and the State Department, which counts in years. Whatever the timing, America and South Korea will have to consider a military strike against the North's nuclear capacity, if negotiations have not taken it out first.
SUBCONTINENTAL, NEAR-NUCLEAR
Both India and Pakistan have long dabbled in nuclear matters. The Indians exploded a ""device"" (peaceful, they insisted) in 1974; having made their point, they apparently put their nuclear programme into abeyance. Pakistan, having lost three wars with its neighbor since independence, has doggedly pursued its nuclear projects. Shahryar Khan, the country's foreign secretary, admitted in Washington in February that ""the capability is there: elements which, if put together, would become a device.""
In January Larry Pressler, an American senator, claimed that the American government believed Pakistan already had a bomb. The Bush administration does not confirm this, yet has since 1990 suspended American aid to Pakistan because President Bush felt himself unable to assure Congress, as he must if aid is to be given, that Pakistan ""does not possess"" a bomb.
There is no American law making aid to India dependent on the president's assurance that it does not have a bomb. Even so, America and Britain are pressing both India and Pakistan not to pursue nuclear ambitions. The neighbours are being urged to sign the NPT, and asked to attend a five-power conference (with Russia, America and China) to declare the subcontinent a nuclear-free zone.
India says it will not sign the NPT until Pakistan does, adding that anyway the treaty is discriminatory. Pakistan refuses to sign, but says it is ready to talk about a nuclear-free zone. India, having briefly seemed to soften, was insisting in January that better relations in general with Pakistan had to precede any talks about a nuclear-free subcontinent.
Both India and Pakistan would be worried if (as now seems less likely) nearby Kazakhstan were to inherit a nuclear arsenal from the Soviet Union. Some suspect that India is biding its time until the mid-1990s, when it will have missile technology to deliver nuclear weapons against China as well as against Pakistan. The Pakistanis, interested in alliances with Islamic neighbours like Iran, would find nuclear expertise useful for making friends as well as for keeping up with the Singhs.
Along the Pakistan-India front line itself, the bomb should not be too disturbing. If the conditions of Soviet-American nuclear stability can anywhere be duplicated in miniature, this is where:two antagonistic powers with a close understanding of each other and a deep interest in seeing that nothing goes wrong. Others in the neighbourhood may not see it that way."

In the right corner Y. Shamir, a sprightly 76; pugnacious and monosyllabic, committed to holding the ring around Greater Israel. In the left corner Y. Rabin, 70, gravel-voiced and terse as his opponent, coming out fighting, vague on exactly where the ropes should be but clearly prepared to see the ring shrink a little.
Serious campaigning does not begin until the month before polling day, June 23rd, but it is already clear that this election will be different from its immediate predecessors. For the past eight years deadlock between the Likud and Labour was. the all-but-inevitable result of Israeli general elections. This time nothing is inevitable.
The chief novelty so far is that Mr Rabin is now safely installed as Labour leader. Having at last beaten his long-time rival, Shimon Peres, he is aiming to win over floating voters who traditionally waver between the two big parties. At the previous election in 1988 the Likud won 40 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, to Labour's 39: a handful either way could tip the balance in the complicated game of building a coalition government. Mr Rabin says he can bring in five extra seats; most polls agree.
Mr Rabin is prepared to surrender part of the territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 war. Israel would retain control of the Jordan Valley and the Golan Heights, although much of the West Bank and perhaps all the Gaza Strip could be surrendered in exchange for a peace settlement. Expanded East Jerusalem would remain in Israeli hands. In contrast, Mr Shamir wants unambiguously to defend every inch of Greater Israel. Choosing Labour leaves open the possibility that a peace deal can be struck, and that the United States may then approve the billions of dollars of loan guarantees it has so far withheld from Mr Shamir.
The economic pressure could be decisive. At this early stage, issues of peace and territory seem to be counting less than questions of personality and domestic politics. On both counts Labour is looking good and the Likud is correspondingly, but still privately, worried. Hanan Crystal, one of the country's most astute political analysts, gives Mr Rabin a 50% chance of winning outright. Mr Rabin consistently comes out top in the popularity stakes. His experience as chief of staff, defence minister and prime minister counts for a lot in a country where deeds, especially security-related ones, are respected more than words. He also has the advantage of being a Sabra, a native-born Israeli. He appears ready to take risks for peace, but he is no cooing dove.
Developments in the enemy camp have favoured him: in his first week as party leader, the Likud moved noisily to the right as it selected and graded its candidates for parliament. Ariel Sharon, the minister of housing and patron of settlement in the West Bank, was placed third on the list, ahead of the ambitious foreign minister, David Levy--a reversal of their levels of popularity in a previous contest.
A drubbing at the hands of the superhawks does not make Mr Levy a dove. It seems unlikely that he will carry out a veiled threat to leave the party. But Likud liberals, such as the justice minister, Dan Meridor, were placed far down in the pecking order on the list of candidates. Mr Levy's humiliating defeat on the home front may also lose the party support among Sephardi (oriental) Jewish Israelis who feel that the slight to the Moroccan-born foreign minister carries a wider message.
Sephardi resentment of years of Labour rule helped bring the Likud to power in 1977 and these long-seated attitudes have clearly not yet disappeared. But Labour strategists believe that by concentrating on social and economic issues, where the Likud's failure is obvious, their party may be able to attract disgruntled Sephardim without launching a frontal ""ethnic"" assault. In his first full-length television interview since becoming party leader, Mr Rabin showed on March 6th that this is one of the main cards he is going to play.
CHARITY STARTS AT HOME
Recent internal Likud polls show the Israeli public to be more concerned by unemployment, immigration and electoral reform than by foreign policy and security. Labour appears to be leading in the fight to win the votes of some 250,000 new immigrants, mostly from the former Soviet Union. With up to ten seats at stake, the Likud is considered to have erred by not choosing a single immigrant candidate. Labour is expected to exploit that weakness when it chooses its candidates at the end of the month.
The Rabin factor could help reverse the traditional tendency of young first-time voters--another ten seats--to lean towards the right. In the Arab vote--up to 14 seats--much is likely to depend on turnout, the impact of the Communist Party's collapse, and the strategic calculation about whether a Labour victory is good for peace.
One clue to the mood in Israel as the big fight draws near was provided on March 9th when the former Likud prime minister, Menachem Begin, died after a heart attack. Mr Begin made peace with Egypt, invaded Lebanon and outshone his successors of both parties as a strong and decisive leader. He was mourned in a spontaneous outpouring of popular grief which crossed party lines and suggested that personality, more than policies, may determine who delivers the knockout blow in June."

Fidel Velasquez, the movement's 91-year-old leader, had just been reelected for his eighth consecutive six-year term as general secretary of the Mexican Workers' Confederation (CTM). No vote was deemed necessary.
Mr Velasquez is a national institution. Mexico's constitution forbids the country's presidents from standing twice for office; but the union leader is permanent, seemingly irreplaceable. Without him, Mr Salinas's government could scarcely have forced through a successful economic stabilisation programme, built on a fall in average real wages of almost 50% since 1982. Mr Velasquez's re-election at the CTM congress on February 25th surprised nobody, and disappointed only his hand-picked deputies, most of them in their 70s and 80s. They, and any radical change in Mexico's trade unions--which many think overdue--must await Don Fidel's death.
The CTM, Mexico's largest confederation of unions, claims 5.5m members, though outsiders think the true figure is between 2.5m and 4m. Both it and Mr Velasquez, who remains mentally alert, are central pillars of Mexico's corporate state, ruled since 1929 by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) under various labels. The unions, and the CTM in particular, are guaranteed a quota of elected offices in return for disciplined adherence to the system. Corrupt union leaders have been tolerated, even encouraged, by the state, as long as they cracked down on wildcat strikes and rank-and-file efforts to form rival, more democratic, workers' organisations.
As the CTM's general secretary from 1941 to 1947, and then since 1950, Mr Velasquez has worked this system better than anyone. A former milkman, he is not poor, but lacks an egregious personal reputation for corruption. For decades he was able to deliver a slow but steady improvement in wages and benefits for his members. In recent years, in the name of social peace, he has presided over wage cuts. Since 1987 the CTM has supported a social pact of wage and (some) price controls that has cut the official inflation rate from 159% to 19% last year.
Corporatism sits ill with the market-driven policies of Mr Salinas. He has chipped away at the unions' powers. Soon after his disputed election in 1988 he imprisoned the leader of the oil workers' union--who was indeed corrupt, but whose big mistake was to have given almost overt backing to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate of a centre-left coalition who challenged Mr Salinas for the presidency. In 1990 the PRI's national assembly reduced the power of its corporate sections. The CTM is no longer guaranteed a fixed quota of candidates for the federal and state governments.
The week before the CTM congress, the government had rushed through the legislature changes in the social-security system that will further weaken the unions. Under a new supplementary pension scheme, employers will pay into individual, interest-bearing bank accounts a sum equal to 2% of wages for each worker. Payments to the workers' housing fund--a bulwark of union patronage--will now also be made to individual bank accounts. Workers will apply direct to the banks for mortgages, and the allocation of houses will no longer be in the gift of union leaders. Gleeful bankers say this will double the size of the financial system in five years, and provide long-term funds for government and business. Fore-knowledge of these measures encouraged bankers to bid up to 3-1/2 times the book value for recently privatised banks.
This seemed like a calculated affront to Mr Velasquez, whose CTM had been the main beneficiary of the housing fund. He complained, but shut up when the ruling party put up one of his people for a state governorship. Still, Mr Velasquez's report to the CTM congress was unusually grouchy. He called the government's application of its anti-inflation policy ""absolutely negative"" and called for restoration of union power in the ruling party.
Mexican governments tolerate Mr Velasquez's rumbles. He remains too useful to dispense with, particularly as his iron control has helped prevent Mr Cardenas's left-wing party from developing a base in the unions. In deference to Don Fidel, Mr Salinas has so far rejected business demands for a loosening of labour laws, though with a free-trade agreement with the United States and Canada under negotiation he may change his tune.
As an alternative, the government has been promoting a national productivity agreement, by which unions would trade more flexible work rules (and jobs) for incentive bonuses. Such a deal has already persuaded the telephone workers' union to support the privatisation of the telephone company, Telmex, in which they now have a 4.4% stake. Their leader, Francisco Hernandez, in 1990 set up an embryo labour confederation with the electricians, the airline pilots and the film technicians. Although he is a keen supporter of Mr Salinas, his confederation is still awaiting legal recognition. By his account, the labour ministry says it is a bad political moment to annoy the traditional union leaders."

The flotation of the naira, Nigeria's beleaguered currency, on March 5th will not cure all the country's ills, but has brought hope that the corrupt and indebted economy is on the path to reform.
The decision eliminates one of the absurder features of the country's financial system. Under the old rules, commercial banks got their hard currency the easy way, buying it from the central bank at auctions where the prices were agreed on in advance. Under these same old rules, the banks then made a huge profit, selling their hard currency to others at margins that grew ever wider. The system kept a lot of bank directors (many with close links to the government) very happy. It may also have cost Nigeria up to $500m a year.
The changes brought in by President Ibrahim Babangida should end this waste. They will make Nigeria's financial markets a bit less opaque, and the accompanying devaluation is meant to boost exports. The decision was announced just as Nigeria was about to begin renegotiating its $33 billion foreign debt. The country's current IMF agreement was suspended last year after the budget deficit, stretched to the limit by wasteful building projects, went way out of bounds. The president clearly wants to show his creditors that there is still life in the stagnating reform programme that he launched in 1986.
Not all Nigerians will benefit immediately, however. Prices of imported goods will rise and nudge up inflation. Economic discontent may add to the problems Mr Babangida is already having in returning his country to civilian rule.
So far the general has kept carefully to his prearranged script. Local and state elections were completed on schedule and without much violence. Fraud has been more difficult to avoid. Last month the chairman of the National Election Commission, Humphrey Nwosu, revealed that Nigeria possessed some 20m ""ghosts"": nonexistent people who have dutifully registered to vote. The ghosts have now been disfranchised, but their discovery does throw the validity of the electoral process, and of last November's census, into question.
Ethnic squabbling looks certain to continue as well. No matter how hard they try, Nigeria's military leaders cannot seem to squeeze Nigeria's multi-tribal reality into their preordained two-party system. In the hope that the country's new president will be chosen for his political beliefs rather than his tribal origins, the government created two political parties, one right of centre and the other left, and told each to hold American-style primaries to select a president. Most of the more than 60 candidates who have declared their candidacy represent the old tribal interests.
A sharp divide has now developed between younger politicians who believe the people ought to choose their president without any interference, and the older political class, which wants matters sewn up in advance. The traditionalists have created king maker committees of prominent ethnic leaders, with names like the Northern Elders, the Middle Belt Forum and the Yoruba Elders, who are endorsing candidates and telling their people how to vote. In the background remains the question of whether a country in the throes of creating democracy will be able to take any more of the hard economic decisions that Nigeria needs."

Opposition posters show President F.W. de Klerk cringing on his knees before an imperious Nelson Mandela; the caption urges white voters to reject Mr Mandela and his klerk, the Afrikaans word for secretary. In the eyes of the right-wing, a ""yes"" vote in the March 17th referendum on Mr de Klerk's reforms is also a yes for Mr Mandela and his African National Congress, black domination, white humiliation, and general chaos.
Meanwhile the government side has been running newspaper advertisements showing a masked man with a cocked revolver and a swastika on his black shirt. The implication is that a ""no"" vote will give power to the AWB, the neo-fascist wing of the anti-reform coalition, and so tip the voteless black majority into rebellion. A ""no"" vote, other advertisements claim, could turn the country into a Lebanon.
Scaring voters with the threat of the black peril is an old tactic in South Africa. Both Mr de Klerk and his right-wing opponents are using it to the full. Each presents the policies of the other in apocalyptic terms, but neither has presented a positive vision of a peaceful, multi-racial future.
The best that the Conservative Party and its coalition partners offer is partition: whites would rule their own states and blacks would rule theirs, even though South Africa's peoples are already geographically intermingled. The Nationalist government and its allies merely present Mr de Klerk as a shrewd strategist who has rolled back sanctions and helped the nation's much-loved sports teams triumphantly back to international competition. The hope is that the president's navigational skills, if not a belief in his destination, will persuade whites to put their trust, and votes, in him.
But Mr de Klerk is also known as the man who is negotiating with the ANC. Leaks suggest that blacks will soon be joining a new ""super cabinet"" to oversee the work of the present government until free elections are held. This is a retreat from the ANC's formal position, which was to press for a constituent assembly elected by universal suffrage. Some blacks already accuse Mr Mandela of letting himself be co-opted. News of the deal poses risks for Mr de Klerk, too. Although it strengthens the impression that he knows how to reach an agreement with the ANC, it also counts against him: black rule suddenly looks too close for comfort.
Mr Mandela himself is campaigning for a white yes, stressing his organisation's commitment to multi-party democracy and promising that the ANC will soon reassess its pro-nationalisation policies. He has said that a Zimbabwean plan to confiscate white farmers' land, which the ""no"" campaign has gleefully pounced on as a warning of things in store at home, has no bearing on South Africa. These remarks, like the plans for power-sharing, are a mixed blessing for Mr de Klerk. They are based on the notion that the ANC will be in control of the country soon, which is precisely what many whites fear.
Opinion polls predict a victory for Mr de Klerk. But they also show that more than one-third of the electorate is either undecided or refuses to declare its views publicly. The outcome may depend less on what whites want, more on which version of the future frightens them most."

These days the population is closer to 500,000, thanks the refugees who have flocked to the city, which lies along the road and railway corridor linking landlocked Zimbabwe to the Indian Ocean. For the past year Mozambique's Renamo rebels have mostly honoured a ceasefire along this corridor (and the Limpopo railway corridor), making Chimoio a safe haven.
So far, these two ceasefire agreements are the only achievements from the 19 months of peace talks that have taken place in Rome between Renamo and the Frelimo government of President Joaquim Chissano. They have not stopped Renamo from attacking the squatter camps around Chimoio in recent weeks, stealing food and clothes and kidnapping young men to serve in rebel ranks. No one is certain whether the attackers are hungry bandits or an organised Renamo unit; or why they are breaking the ceasefire now.
Since assuming the presidency in 1986, Mr Chissano has rejected Marxism, introduced a free press and independent judiciary, installed an IMF structural-adjustment programme and at the same time met Renamo's demands for a multi-party democracy and free-market economy. This has won him the support of the United States and Britain. But Renamo's leader, Afonso Dhlakama, has now expanded his demands to include a system of proportional representation and pre-election administrative control over the areas he now controls.
The talks in Rome, however, are only loosely attached to the facts on the ground. It is far from clear that anybody is capable of making Renamo agree to a ceasefire. The force was set up in 1976 by the former white regime in Rhodesia and used against the Marxist Mozambican regime, which sheltered Rhodesia's black guerrillas. When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980, South Africa took over the arming and training of Renamo, in the name of anti-communism. With the help of South African weapons and training, Renamo destroyed railways and communications, leaving much of the Mozambican countryside without any effective government.
The South Africans now say that they have ended all assistance to Renamo. Some evidence suggests otherwise. It is possible that the South African army, or parts of it, are still delivering weapons and food without the full knowledge of their political masters. In an atmosphere of continuing lawlessness, these provisions may be keeping rebel bands (like those near Chimoio) in business.
Without its great ally to organise and direct it, however, large chunks of Renamo may no longer know whether to keep fighting or not. In Chimoio recently an aid worker who drove a kilometre too far beyond the airport was suddenly surrounded by some 50 Renamo rebels. Knowing the group's reputation, he prepared himself for the worst. Instead, the rebels' leader sat down and asked him what he thought of the Rome talks. His group wanted peace, but did not understand what was holding up negotiations, and had decided that an ambush was the only way to get an outsiders' opinion."

Yes, another one is coming, and sooner than you imagined-as early as next year, if Jacques Delors and his European Commission have their way.
This is because the commission wants to use the imminent enlargement of the Community to push the EC even faster towards federalism. It now has a clearer idea of how the enlargement might happen: not piecemeal, but in two great waves. The first will carry in the richer neighbours from the European Free Trade Association (with varying degrees of enthusiasm, all EC members now accept that the EFTA folk should sail in, provided they accept the ambitions set down in the Maastricht treaty). The second wave would bring the more precarious aspirants from Eastern Europe.
An apparently smallish event next week will set the first wave rolling. On March 18th Finland's parliament will vote to apply for EC membership. Finland's arrival on a tide that already bears Austria, Sweden, Malta and Cyprus puts the Community in a quandary. It reckoned that it could let in Austria and Sweden without any serious upheaval. But Finland's application makes it likely that two other EFTA members, Norway and Switzerland, will also apply. The view in Brussels, Bonn and Paris is that if the EC has to take in at least five new members its institutions will need reforming.
The commission is preparing a report on enlargement for next June's Lisbon summit. It is likely to suggest that a ""mini inter-governmental conference"" should run parallel to the entry talks with EFTA countries that are expected to start next year. This would tackle some urgent institutional problems, leaving the conference already scheduled for 1996 to deal with big strategic questions such as defence.
Will Maastricht-weary governments accept another round of reform so soon? The two that matter most will. The German foreign ministry welcomes the prospect. And the French foreign ministry argues that the arrival of a handful of new members, rather than a couple, means that institutional issues have to be tackled. No prizes for guessing the likeliest foot-dragger: Britain (at least, the current British government) wants the beast of ""political union"" to be left dormant until 1996.
The EFTA countries themselves dislike the idea of the EC changing its rules before they can join. But they could have observer status at the mini-conference, just as Spain and Portugal were allowed to watch the conference that produced the Single European Act in 1985.
Frans Andriessen, the external-relations commissioner, is heading a group that is working on the Lisbon paper. The thrust of the commission's thinking is becoming clear. It will argue that the European Council, Parliament and Commission could not function effectively in a Community of 17 members. So it will propose more majority voting, more say for the commission in EC committees, and an average of fewer than one commissioner per country.
The commission may propose that larger members--especially Germany--should have more weight in the European Parliament. It also wants to reform the EC presidency, which now rotates every six months. The EC'S efforts to manage common foreign policies would risk derision if a minnow was in charge during a crisis.
The commission's paper will take a tough line on neutrality, arguing that any member must be ready to join economic sanctions against a third country (Finland, for example, would not be let off sanctions against Russia). All would have to take part in joint foreign policies. And none would be allowed to thwart the Community's progress towards a common defence. One close adviser of Mr Delors wants all new members to accept eventual membership of the Western European Union, a body that may become the EC'S defence wing.
Nordic neutrality seems flexible these days. The Alpine version may prove more awkward. Austrians seem attached to neutrality, since it helps to differentiate them from Germans. Switzerland, not yet in the United Nations, is mountains away from a common European defence.
Some of the EFTA countries may miss the boat that is expected to carry a group of new countries into the Community in 1995. The EC will not want to consider newcomers during the big round of constitutional revision that will start in 1996. It was largely this that decided the Finns to apply now. Finland's biggest concern during entry talks will be agriculture; those who farm its chilly soil will lose the benefit of farm prices currently twice the EC level.
Finland's decision makes it much more likely that Norway will apply. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, has told her Labour Party to debate EC membership--on which it is divided--before its congress in November. The opposition conservatives want Norway to move faster, but Dr Brundtland will not rush her party, which was painfully split in the 1972 referendum on EC entry. The signs are that Labour will approve her pro-EC line, allowing an application to be lodged in November. The government believes that would still leave time to take part in next year's entry talks. Norway, a NATO member, does not have the neutrality problem.
Switzerland has declared EC membership a goal but will find it harder to catch the EFTA boat. Its Foreign minister (and federal president), Rene Felber, a Socialist, wants Switzerland to apply this spring. But the Christian Democrats and the Radicals, who fear splits in their own parties, want no application before the referendum due in December on the European Economic Area. Those most firmly opposed to the EC, as in Norway and Finland, are the farmers.
The commission reckons that entry talks with Switzerland will be sticky. The EC will insist, for instance, that Switzerland introduces a value-added tax and that its referendums cannot overturn EC laws. The other EFTA countries worry that, if they cannot join until talks with Switzerland are complete, they may have a long wait.
The commission's Lisbon paper will look ahead to how the EC could cope with a second wave of new members at the end of the decade, from Eastern Europe. This poses much greater problems. If Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia were let in, on current criteria the regional-aid budget would have to double from the 29 billion ecus ($36 billion) that the commission plans for 1997. Industrial, farm and budgetary policy would have to be completely rethought. In Bonn there is talk of some East Europeans joining in 1998. In Paris they think it will take at least a decade longer.
The commission fears that the Community might eventually drown in its own numbers. ""Ministers will find it hard to communicate if there are 24 of them around a table,"" says an adviser to Mr Delors. But the tide, he believes, cannot be turned back."

Once urgent advocates of a European Union, they are now wailing about the Maastricht conference in December which set a firm schedule for it. Is this evidence that Europe's weightiest nation believes it can now do better on its own?
Not quite. But it is a warning sign for Germany's partners all the same. For decades Germans yearned for a united Europe as a semi-substitute for their own defeated, divided and occupied fatherland. They thought the aim so self-evident, in stark contrast to the British and to a lesser extent the French, that they really debated only the means. German unity has started to change that. For one thing the Germans have regained full sovereignty, so they have more to sacrifice in the European cause. For another, the unity bill is proving so huge that Germans are scared of taking on the extra costs they expect more European integration to involve.
Even so, the domestic debate about Europe stayed tepid in the run-up to Maastricht--to the relief of keen integrationists in the government who reckoned that getting an agreement there would be tough enough without (they now cynically admit) the distraction of a battle at home. Belatedly, the battle has now started. Germans have realised that their beloved D-mark will probably be replaced by the ecu from 1999 at the latest, and some of them are up in arms.
To many non-Germans, this reaction seems curious, for two reasons. First, the timing: negotiations on the Maastricht treaty continued all last year, and it was no secret what was at stake. If many Germans are afraid of giving up the D-mark, why did they not protest earlier? Second, the treaty's content: the Maastricht deal on economic and monetary union (EMU)--prescribing an independent central bank, modest state deficits and low inflation--was fashioned largely in Germany's image.
At least in its former image. With its hefty (unity-induced) government borrowing, inflation at 4.3%, record interest rates and a currency at present hardly holding its own against the Greek drachma, Germany is no longer the model it used to be. Despite that (and in unconscious observance of Groucho Marx's precept that he would not belong to any club that would accept him as a member), Germans are telling opinion pollsters they want to hang on to the D-mark for dear life. Editorialists whine that the chancellor, Helmut Kohl, was tricked in Maastricht by the French, eager as ever to get their hands on German currency reserves. And even some Bundesbankers moan about the ""irreversible"" EMU timetable, claiming that they, in turn, feel tricked by Mr Kohl.
Undeniably, progress in Maastricht towards a political union fell short of what Mr Kohl said in advance he wanted (though it was probably at least as much as he expected). Hence he is getting stick from all parties, including his own Christian Democrats, for not insisting that far greater powers should be given to the European Parliament, and that more seats in it should go to the united Germans. The Lander (regions) also clamour that rights guaranteed them under the federal German constitution are being signed away ""to Brussels"" without adequate consultation and control.
Does all that mean the Maastricht treaty will not after all be ratified this year by the German parliament? Hardly. Mr Kohl, who now dominates German politics like no other post-war chancellor, is determined to keep the critics in his own party on a short leash. The Free Democrats (liberals), junior partners in the centre-right coalition government, will line up behind Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister and another Maastricht fan. The opposition Social Democrats, who lack any leadership to speak of these days, have grudgingly agreed to go along too, despite calls for resistance by Oskar Lafontaine, their (now middle-aged) enfant terrible.
ALMOST AN OPT-OUT
The treaty therefore looks set to go through on schedule. But parliamentarians are threatening to attach a rider saying they will take stock of the agreement again in 1996. Might that imply that Germany could then decide to wiggle off the EMU hook after all, that its parliament is in effect trying to give itself something like a British opt-out? Nobody in Germany would put it that bluntly. Clearly, though, passing the Maastricht treaty will not mean the end of the delayed German debate on Europe. Probably it is just beginning.
For example, the government will need to explain as it has never really had to before why it believes the impending death of the D-mark and higher bills to Brussels will be in Germany's interest. And although the parliamentary parties accept they can do little now to change the treaty text, none of them sees it as the final blueprint for European Union. They are after all sorts of ""improvements"" in the next year or two--especially a pledge to boost the European Parliament and still firmer guarantees that the entry conditions for full EMU (when it comes, in either 1997 or 1999) will not be watered down.
Mr Kohl believes in any event that the closer Europe comes to full EMU, the greater will be the pressure to strengthen Europe's political institutions; so that in the end the Germans will get their way, at least on the parliament. Suppose they do not. Would they then try to opt out of the monetary union, even if Mr Kohl--keen to be remembered as chancellor of German and European unity--were still government leader? It is hard to believe they would, but Germany is becoming a tougher partner these days and is slowly waking up to the fact that it has more options than it used to."

You might suppose that the people of this treeless, half-frozen island would be eager for the warmth of the European Community, especially since East-West harmony has reduced the importance of the NATO base on the island. Not a bit of it. Apart from Liechtenstein, Iceland is the only country in Europe determined to stay out of the EC.
Havin gained their independence from Denmark in 1944, Icelanders have no desire to fall under continental tutelage again. They enjoy their mid-Atlantic position, going to Glasgow to shop but increasingly sending their young to America for university education.
The 250,000 islanders are nervous of being submerged in the EC. They worry that European investors could take over local land and business, even the choicest salmon rivers. Economic arguments for membership fail to impress: although Iceland's economy has been as fast-moving as a local Glacier for the past decade, the country enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world.
The main issue is fish, which still accounts for more than 70% of Iceland's visible exports. Icelanders value their fishing monopoly in the 200-mile zone around the island; a veteran gunboat from the cod war is still moored in Reykjavik harbour. If Iceland joined the Community, the EC's common fishing policy would jeopardise the islanders' exclusive rights, a prospect made all the more unpopular recently by the falling volume of catches. No politician dares to suggest that the fishermen's interests might have to be sacrificed to help other industries. The hostility to the EC is so deep that half the population is opposed to the modest deal to include Iceland in the proposed European Economic Area of EFTA and EC countries, even though that deal would make it easier for Iceland to export its fish to the Community.
Nonetheless, the deal is likely to be approved in parliament. David Oddsson, the prime minister, recognises that if other EFTA countries eventually join the Community Iceland might have to have second thoughts about staying out. But Mr Oddsson, who is an admirer of that arch Euro-sceptic Margaret Thatcher, is unlikely to pioneer a pro-EC movement. Mr Oddsson is a playwright and former radio satirist. He wears his hair long, but his politics is right of centre. He was a flamboyant mayor of Reykjavik until he ousted the leader of the conservative Independence Party last March. The next month he was elected to parliament and within ten days became prime minister. He has had a bumpy time ever since.
His coalition with the Social Democrats has embraced Thatcherism with a vengeance. Public spending is being slashed, hospital staff sacked by the hundreds and state industries privatised. Mr Oddsson has reduced inflation in the past quarter to zero, in a country that was close to hyperinflation a decade ago. But there is no gratitude. With Iceland's GNP set to fall by 6% this year and the public sector howling in pain, Mr Oddsson has gone from being the most-popular-ever mayor to being the most-unpopular-ever prime minister in just nine months. A lonely man in an isolated but unlonely country."

Mr Gorbachev's answer was a new union treaty. On the eve of its signing, he was toppled by a coup. The coup failed, but the Soviet Union then fell apart. Mr Yeltsin's solution is a new Russian constitution. Might the Russian federation, too, fall apart?
A new constitution is sorely needed. In the past two years the existing one has been amended 204 times. The central problem is that the powers of parliament and the president were defined in the days when the Communist Party ruled the country. There is no clear division between them.
The proposed new constitution would scrap the current legislature, in which an inner parliament (the Supreme Soviet) conducts day-to-day business while a huge Congress meets infrequently as the supreme legislative authority. Instead, there would be a system modelled on America's. A state Duma, like the House of Representatives, would have 300 members directly elected according to the distribution of voters. A federal assembly, like the Senate, would have three delegates from each republic or province. The two houses would pass laws separately.
Following traditional Soviet practice, the president's role is now, formally, ceremonial. Mr Yeltsin's authority stems largely from emergency powers. But these are ill-defined. Under the new constitution, the president would et clear powers similar to those of the French or American presidents--to dissolve the legislature, declare war and suchlike. In short, in place of a hybrid and confused system, Russia would get a recognisably western constitution. If, that is, agreement can first be reached on how to divide power between central and local government.
Under the Soviet system Russia was not only divided up into regions, but contained within it 16 ""autonomous"" republics (with their own parliaments and some law-making powers). In the past year, encouraged by the collapse of the Soviet Union, all have demanded more power and have unilaterally inflated their status from ""autonomous"" to ""full"" republics. Just as former Soviet republics declared that the Soviet constitution had no force on their territories, so several Russian ones have said that Russian laws do not apply to them.
Last November opposition from these republics to an earlier draft of the constitution led the Russian parliament to refuse even to discuss it. The government then decided to tackle the problem of the division of powers separately. It suggested that republics and 55 regions should sign a federal treaty; which would enshrine proposals to devolve much administrative power to the republics. The treaty's provisions would be incorporated into the constitution. The constitution would guarantee central control over the essential functions of the Russian state--not just federal taxes and spending but also a Russian army.
The federal treaty is faring badly. Most republics want more powers. Some refuse to sign any treaty at all, demanding special bilateral arrangements with Russia's federal authorities. On March 21st one of the most populous republics, Tatarstan, will hold a referendum on ""sovereignty"". While this stops short of authorising secession, the referendum could, if it passes, encourage others to follow suit, complicating matters further.
On April 6th the Russian Congress reconvenes. This is the only body that can change the constitution. If the new constitution is to be adopted, the federal treaty must be approved beforehand. In theory, it could be: it requires only a majority of signatures and, since ordinary regions support it, it could be approved even if all republics refuse. But this would set off a huge row with the republics.
Others dislike the proposed constitution for other reasons. Former Communists will resist Mr Yeltsin in every way they can. Delegates from regions with large defence factories are incensed at defence cuts.
THE FORCE IS WITH YELTSIN
A showdown similar to the one that unseated Mr Gorbachev looks inevitable. But in this conflict, Mr Yeltsin has some powerful weapons. Unlike Mr Gorbachev's, his government controls its territory and raises taxes. Plenty of Russians live in the former autonomous republics. The Soviet republics could band together and wish Mr Gorbachev away. Russia's republics cannot do the same to Mr Yeltsin.
What is more, many of the leaders of Russia's republics are former Communist apparatchiks who have donned national dress to preserve their power. The Tatar president, for example, supported the failed Moscow putsch. The leader of Komi led a hardline group of Communist deputies. It is not clear how much popular support they have. Despite powerful anti-Russian feelings, in many republics more than half the population is Russian. So if the worst came to the worst, and the Congress rejected the constitution, Mr Yeltsin could appeal directly to voters by putting his plans to a referendum. Some of his supporters want him to do this anyway.
The trouble here is that pressure would then grow to hold quick parliamentary elections. Mr Yeltsin does not want them; they could dissipate his reforms. Nor do his conservative opponents want them, since they might lose their seats. Mr Yeltsin has offered them a way out: if the Congress adopts the constitution, transitional arrangements would come into force allowing the current deputies to keep their jobs until 1995. This maybe just enough to squeeze the constitution past the Congress. Once it had been adopted, Russia's republics would find it harder to hold out against it."

What is new about Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front is its apparent durability and its capacity to attract support across the social spectrum. For the past eight years it has regularly won 10% or more of the vote. In the regional elections on March 22nd polls suggest it will get 12-15%. Mr Le Pen himself could well find himself at the head of France's second-most-populous region, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur.
The mainstream right accuses the Socialists of deliberately promoting the Front in order to split the conservative vote. If there was ever any truth in this (and there probably was), most Socialists today are genuinely anxious to stop Mr Le Pen. He has come to represent a real danger to democracy. The trouble is they do not know how best to tackle him. If they confront him head on, they are accused of giving him free publicity. If they ignore him, they are accused of giving him a free rein. So they vacillate.
At the beginning of the current election campaign, the tactic was all-out attack. Socialist mayors (and some right-wing ones too) refused to allow the Front access to their municipal halls for its meeting. Socialist militants helped organise local anti-Le Pen demonstrations, which frequently degenerated into violence. The government then gave the prefets, its representatives in the provinces, tacit encouragement to ban National Front meetings on the ground that they constituted a threat to public order. Mr Le Pen was delighted. Night after night he was able to appear before millions of television viewers as a persecuted martyr who was upholding the democratic right of free expression against the ""totalitarian"" practices of the government.
The Socialists have belatedly changed tactics. The interior minister has reaffirmed the right of the Front to hold its meetings. The Socialist Party has warned its militants against taking part in violent demonstrations. Bernard Tapie, the businessman leading the Socialist campaign against Mr Le Pen in Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, has apologised for saying that; if Mr Le Pen was a salaud (""bastard""), then all those who voted for him must be bastards too. Socialist leaders have realised that their decision to rest their campaign so heavily on the fight against Mr Le Pen is in danger of backfiring. Many clearly regard the moderate right as a better bulwark against the Front than the Socialists, and will vote accordingly.
People say that Mr Le Pen's sophisticated new wife has tamed him--made him more elegant, less aggressive, more statesmanlike. But behind the well-tailored suits and erudite-sounding Latin phrases, the bully-boy still lurks. His public performances are masterly. No other politician in France today can match him. Like an American television evangelist, he paces up and down the stage with a cordless microphone hidden under his lapel, venting his emotions and posing as the only possible saviour of France from all the dangers that are supposedly threatening it. Those include immigrants, crime, drugs, AIDS, moral decadence, political corruption and those European ""federasts"" in Brussels. The truth is constantly distorted, racist innuendos insidiously inserted.
The audience laps it up. Mr Le Pen can hold them spell-bound for well over two hours with an unstoppable flow of words, delivered without a single note. When they finally go away to the uplifting strains of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"", they clearly feel that their FFr35 ($6) entrance fee was worth every centime."

The day after a necessarily unspectacular budget, with the country deep in recession and with his party lagging in the polls, he led the Tories into battle to fight for a fourth consecutive victory. Labour and the Liberal Democrats swiftly predicted that 13 years of Toryism would end on April 9th.
After deciding not to call an election last autumn, Mr Major had come to terms with the fact that there would be few signs of economic recovery before the Tories' term ran out in July. For weeks Westminster had assumed that April 9th was the chosen date. Voters were becoming bored with the relentless political bickering; businessmen had been complaining bitterly about the uncertainty. It was time to go.
The budget had been widely tipped as a dramatic tax hand-out, crude but effective. That being impossible, Mr Lamont tried to compensate by aiming the little tax relief he could give at groups of voters, and areas of the country, which will be particularly important in winning the election. A new 20p tax band would, Tory MPs said, win back some of the Thatcherite working classes. Measures for small business were aimed at another politically wobbly group; help for the car industry went down well in the Midlands, packed with marginal seats. But it was far from being the springboard that Tory partisans in the media and the markets had hoped for.
The chancellor's second aim was to embarrass Labour by challenging Neil Kinnock to vote against the 20p lower tax band. After some ducking and weaving in the chamber, Mr Kinnock accepted the challenge. The Labour leadership decided to stick to its line that borrowing to finance tax cuts was unacceptable.
That may help ignite a campaign that had seemed in danger of boring everybody. Tories can now plausibly argue that Labour will not only take more tax from the higher-paid, but from everyone. Labour, though, will be able to say that there is money available to spend on better services. Though this highlights the philosophical difference between the parties, the sums involved are paltry. The danger is that both sides will relapse into negative campaigning, sickening a jaded electorate.
The parties' campaigns open properly on Monday March 16th. From then on there will be a barrage of press conferences and staged photo-opportunities running daily from 7.15am until late evening. In a tight campaign, all may hinge on a few dozen seats in the Midlands and north-west (see next article). Curiously, though, little of the national campaign will occur there, as politicians from all sides slug it out in front of the cameras in and around Westminster's magic square mile.
Conservative tactics will be to try to turn the national debate away from the government's handling of the recession, and towards the fitness of Labour to govern. While Mr Major mingles telegenically with voters (his grin and unpompous manner are thought to be particularly useful), Conservative Central Office has allocated special roles to Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, and Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Mr Hurd has been told to be calm and statesmanlike, setting out the Tories' broad vision Mr Heseltine, designated the chief Labour-basher, has not been told to be calm and statesmanlike; as one senior minister explained, ""we've starved him of red meat for a fortnight.""
Labour, by contrast, seems confident that Mr Kinnock will surprise the Conservatives by his verve and campaigning impact, as he did in 1987. Then, say party managers, Labour had a good campaign but a poor product; this time the campaign may be slightly less glitzy, but the product is incomparably better.
Cabinet ministers are under standing orders from Downing Street not to discuss publicly two things: a hung parliament; and their strategy if the Conservatives had another disastrous campaign in Scotland and were faced with a constitutional crisis.
Both issues are taboo because Tories find them demoralising. But it may yet turn out that the ambitions of both Mr Major and Mr Kinnock are frustrated by the small fry--Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, and the Scottish National Party. Both have their eyes on a handful of seats which, in a close result, could give them the power to change Westminster dramatically."

When the electorate goes to the polls next month, the shape of the next government will in effect be decided by one in six of the votes--those cast in constituencies won by the Tories in 1987 with small majorities.
Assume for a moment a uniform voting pattern in every constituency, repeating within each the national pecking-order of the parties. Our table lists the 100 Tory marginals most vulnerable, on a simple arithmetical basis, to a swing to Labour. (Table omitted) Pick the national votes you think the two main parties are likely to get on polling day, and the list shows which Tory MPS would get the chop. Since the Conservatives ended up with a lead of nearly 12% over Labour in 1987, a mere 11% lead for John Major on April 9th would unseat five Tory MPs, starting with Conal Gregory in York. A 5.2% lead for Labour at a national level would win it all 100 constituencies.
Both main parties may lose some seats to the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish and Welsh Nationalists; they may also win one or two from the smaller parties. But the net effect is likely to be small. Our table therefore gives a fair picture of the task facing the big parties. Each has a mountain to climb if it hopes to form a majority government.
Take Labour first. The parliament to be dissolved on March 16th had 369 Conservatives and 229 Labour members. A new constituency will be contested, in Milton Keynes, which would certainly have gone to the Tories in 1987; So count 370 seats for Mr Major. Merely to prevent him having an absolute majority on April 10th, Labour must capture 45 Tory seats (as well as retaining four seats won in by-elections during the 1987-92 parliament and keeping hold of three seats where Labour MPS have defected or been expelled). To become the largest single party, Labour needs to capture 71 Tory seats. To secure an overall Commons majority of its own, it must snatch 97.
The triple threshold facing Labour may not be exactly 45, 71 and 97 gains from the Tories; the smaller parties will cause some variations. But these are the numbers Labour must aim for--turfing out a good many Tory ministers in the process.
Now see the table from the Tories' point of view. Four of the six national polls published this month have given Labour a slight lead; an ICM poll in the Guardian on March 11th put Labour three points ahead. This represents a 7.5% swing against the Tories since 1987. If the votes went this way on April 9th, the Tories would lose 79 marginals to Labour. The Tories have to hold 34 of these to keep their majority.
But how likely is it that the national standing of the main parties will be mirrored in these 100 marginals? They are certainly not a microcosm of the nation. But neither is there any obvious reason to expect them to vary much from the national vote. Exactly half of the 100 seats are concentrated in three parts of the country: London, the north-west and the west Midlands. The varying impact of the recession on these regions--with London hit far harder than the others--could conceivably produce some eccentric voting patterns. The effect of national politics, notably the poll-tax row, has also varied; it could influence the vote in many Pennine constituencies, for example, which used to enjoy low rateable values. But none of the three key regions appears to offer either main party a clear advantage on local economic or political grounds.
Some research has pointed to the advantage in an election of being the incumbent MP. Recent elections have suggested that a hard-working MP in a marginal seat may collect as many as 1,500 votes by earning a good local reputation. But even this personal vote is usually won only in the first parliamentary term of an MP's career--and only five of the 100 marginals were won by the Conservatives for the first time in 1987."

Since 1883 there have been tough limits on campaign spending in the constituencies. In this year's election no candidate will be allowed to spend more than L3,648 ($6,265) plus 4.1p per voter in rural seats or plus 3.3p per voter in urban seats. This means that the average candidate will have around L6,000 to spend or less than 10p to shower on each elector. Many spend less. In 1987 total spending by all candidates was L8m.
More is spent by the parties at national level, where they are not constrained by any legal limits on spending. The three main parties spent L14m in 1987. Even so, all forms of official party spending amounted to just over 50 pence per elector. In the American election of 1988, by way of contrast, total party spending was equivalent to L1.5 billion--L8 per elector, or 16 times more than in Britain. Continental European countries, notably Germany, also spend far more on their big campaigns.
There has been a rise in central-party spending in Britain in the past decade, and there is likely to be another jump this time; but there is no clear long-term trend, as the chart shows. (chart omitted) The real value of spending was much the same in 1987 as in 1964; in America it tripled between 1964 and 1988.
One reason for the parsimony of British politics stands out above all others: the parties are banned from using television commercials, apart from the ""party-political broadcasts"" for which air time is provided free. In the current campaign, most of the central-party funds will be devoted to posters, press advertising and staff costs.
Convention has it that British politics would be healthier if the parties were state-subsidised, as they are in most other European countries. The case for reform is aired periodically. Some push it as a remedy for Labour's heavy dependence on the trade unions; the party had to rely on the unions to pay for over 93% of its 1987 campaign. Others urge reform as a response to dodgy donations. The Tories have recently been embarrassed by reports that they have sought cash from foreign tycoons--including the former chairman of Polly Peck, Asil Nadir, who apparently gave them L440,000 without telling his own shareholders.
Some argue that the current system gives the Tories an unfair advantage: in this election they are expected to outspend Labour by three-to-one at the national level. But the gap between their budgets shrinks abruptly when the system's ""hidden subsidies"" are taken into account. Free television time for party-political broadcasts was worth L7m each to the three major parties in the 1987 election; and all candidates are given free postage to deliver their election addresses, together with the free use of council halls for election meetings. An academic authority on political campaigning, Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, has reviewed both the direct and ""hidden"" spending of the main parties in 1987. He estimates that the Conservatives spent L24.9m, Labour L19.7m and the SDP-Liberal Alliance L16.5m.
The picture does not seem so benign when viewed from the parties' headquarters. All three big parties are living on borrowed money. Labour has found it hard to get more cash out of the unions, whose membership has fallen by a third in the past 13 years; the party has an overdraft of nearly L2m. The Tories have found it tricky to extract cash from recession-strapped companies: they now boast a L12m overdraft. The Liberal Democrats owe less, but also raise far less. If the election should lead to a hung parliament and a second election later in 1992, there will be three party treasurers with red faces."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224153415/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/34?accountid=14657,"In living memory no chancellor has presented a pre-election budget in such dire economic circumstances. Output will have fallen by roughly 2-1/2% in the 12 months to polling day. Since the second world war, the only challenge to that pre-election record is 1973-74. The Labour government of the day won the election of October 1974, the second in nine months, because it could plausibly blame the recession on the Tories. In 1992, after 13 years of Conservative government, blaming Labour is a luxury denied to Norman Lamont. Unpromising though it was, he was obliged to seem constructive: this was, in the chancellor's words, ""a budget for recovery"".
Happily, and surprisingly, it wasn't. Mr Lamont resisted the temptation to ""kick-start"" the economy with large tax cuts. The changes he announced will raise the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the next financial year by only a little more than L2 billion (L1-1/2 billion, if you exclude some changes that were announced earlier). Cuts of L3 billion or L4 billion had been widely predicted. Within his self-imposed limit, Mr Lamont was driven more by politics than by economics in designing his reforms (see the next two articles). Chancellors are capable of only so much virtue.
Mr Lamont was right to show restraint, despite the recession, because of the alarming deterioration in the public finances. The Treasury now expects the PSBR for 1991-92 to be L14 billion, compared with last year's budget forecast of L8 billion. That is nothing beside what is in prospect. The PSBR for 1992-93, including the chancellor's cautious tax cuts, is guessed to be L28 billion (4-1/2% of GDP). This would be a cool L16 billion more than he forecast last year. And in 1993-94 the Treasury expects the PSBR, and its forecasting error, to be bigger still.
These numbers came as a shock to the financial markets. Most City economists had been forecasting a PSBR of around L25 billion next year, and that on the assumption of a L4 billion hand-out of tax cuts. The markets decided that the chances of an interest-rate cut before the election had diminished; so on March 11th shares fell and market-driven interest rates moved up. Perhaps that initial surprise explains why many City pundits seemed muddled this year. Commentators sprang immediately into print complaining of (a) the government's reckless borrowing plans and (b) the lack of any decisive measures to stimulate the economy.
To pair these charges is plainly absurd, unless you are willing to add a third: that the chancellor should have taken sterling out of the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM). Otherwise, with monetary policy assigned to defence of the pound, economic policy can be prudent or expansionary, but unfortunately not both.
Taken one at a time, the two fiscal criticisms are hardly more plausible. Concerning (a): the budget was as close to fiscally neutral as pre-election politics would allow. And even the most hair-shirted opponent of counter-cyclical demand-management would hardly choose now as the time for a discretionary tightening of fiscal policy (ie, higher taxes)--unless, as the Labour Party proposes, this were to take the form of taxes on the ""rich"". Concerning (b): ""decisive"" tax cuts, pushing the expected PSBR to well over L30 billion, would have run the clear risk of undermining sterling and triggering a rise in interest rates--which would have been economically ill-advised as well as politically suicidal.
But that is precisely why economists such as Sir Alan Walters continue to argue that sterling should indeed be taken out of the ERM. Let the pound float, cut interest rates by two or three percentage points, and tighten up on the fiscal side, he says: this is how to combine prudence and expansion. For political reasons, it was hardly an option for Mr Lamont--though Sir Alan's advice was presumably well-meaning. Politics aside, does his economics make sense?
The change he and his followers propose would lead to a sharp fall in the pound. In an economy as open as Britain's, that would directly spur inflation. Soon, therefore, the government would have to push interest rates back up again--and, most likely, by a long way. As sterling's credibility within the ERM has improved, British interest rates have fallen steadily (contrary to many predictions). With the pound outside the mechanism, and the credibility of the government's monetary policy smashed, rates would have to rise well beyond their present level (with a correspondingly bigger fall in output and employment) to pack the same disinflationary punch.
Mr Lamont, then, given few choices, chose well. With his broadly appropriate macroeconomic policies in place, the short-term outlook is undeniably bleak. The Treasury now expects output to grow by only 1% this year, which would be a puny recovery indeed from the sharp fall in output of 1991 (see table)(table omitted). But the slowdown has curbed inflation; the chancellor said he expects prices to rise by less than 4% this year. In 1993, voters willing, Mr Lamont hopes to be celebrating a much happier combination of inflation at 3-1/4% and growth in output of 3%. If that comes true, he will be forgiven his hefty PSBR (which, with output growing so quickly, would soon start to shrink) and a current-account deficit pencilled in at L9 billion (which should be readily financeable).
In that event Mr Lamont might also be looking forward to the first of the new unified budgets he has promised to introduce. Starting in December 1993, the autumn economic statement and the spring budget would be combined, bringing together the government's plans for public spending and taxes. This reform, also promised by the Labour Party, ought to confront spending ministries more directly with the implications of their proposals for taxes--though some Treasury officials apparently have their doubts about that. What is beyond doubt is that unified budgets would improve the quality of public debate over fiscal choices. For that reason alone, the idea deserves to be welcomed."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224141507/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/35?accountid=14657,"Almost everybody had been expecting Mr Lamont to cut the basic rate of income tax by at least 1p in the pound, to 24p. Almost everybody was wrong. The chancellor instead used the money to introduce a lower-rate band of 20% on the first L2,000 ($3,400) of taxable income.
This was politically a canny move. Mr Lamont was able to present the lower-rate band as help for the poor--three-quarters of the tax hand-out will go to taxpayers on less than average male earnings--while at the same time selling it to richer voters as a first step towards the Tories' medium-term goal of a 20% basic rate of income tax.
But if the government's aim was to help the least well-off, a lower-rate band is rather an inefficient way to do it. That is one reason why the Tories abolished the 25% lower band (introduced by Labour) in 1980. A better approach is to increase personal allowances: this removes some of the poor from the tax net altogether, and sharply reduces average tax rates for many others.
The new 20% band will cost the Treasury L1.8 billion in 1992-93. For that sum, Mr Lamont could have increased allowances by almost another L400 on top of the L150 by which they were raised to match inflation. This would have taken almost 1m low-income earners out of the tax net. The 20% band will also complicate the tax system. The 4m taxpayers who will fall entirely within the 20% band will, for instance, be entitled to claim back from the taxman the 5% excess of the 25% tax deducted at source from their interest income.
Mr Lamont argues that 25% was far too high as a starting rate of tax. Adding in the 9% national-insurance contributions, the total rate at which the taxman first appears was, before the budget, 34%. This was the highest (jointly with Germany) of the rates in the big seven industrial economies. The new total starting rate of 29% is now close to the average. But, as the chart shows, Britain is also out of line in another way: the level of income at which people start to pay tax is much lower than in most other economies. In Britain a married man starts to pay income tax at an income of L5,165. Americans, by contrast, have to earn the equivalent of L9,400 before they get stung for tax, and the French can earn L11,300.
During the past four decades, allowances have failed to keep pace with earnings, dragging more and more workers into the tax net. In 1963-64 a single person's tax allowance was equivalent to 30% of average earnings. Today it is just under 20%. All this strengthens the case for raising personal allowances in Britain rather than introducing a lower-rate band.
Although personal allowances were raised by L150, in line with inflation, Mr Lamont gathered some money by freezing the married couple's allowance and the threshold of taxable income at which the 40% higher rate of tax becomes payable. Since earnings have risen by more than 7% over the past year, this will mean that more workers will now face a 40% rate.
This exacerbated another quirk of Britain's tax system. A married person starts to pay the top 40% rate on income above L28,865, equivalent to barely 1-1/2 times average earnings. In America the top tax threshold is four times average earnings, and in Germany and France it is more than six times. The result is that British executives pay higher average tax rates than their foreign counterparts.
The introduction of the 20% band together with the increase in personal allowances will cut most people's annual tax bills by L138. Before the budget a worker on half average earnings (ie, around L9,000) paid 15.9% of it to the tax man; this will now fall to 14.3%. A managing director on five times average earnings (L90,000) will fail to detect the drop in his average tax rate: it will fall just 0.2 percentage points, to 35%.
The picture changes if you take the Tories' 14 budgets together. Before Mrs Thatcher took office in 1979, a worker on five times average earnings faced an average tax rate of 51.6%; that has fallen to just 35% today. Over the same period the average tax rate of anybody on half average earnings has actually risen (see table on previous page).(table omitted)
In a further effort to make Labour squirm, Mr Lamont gave some extra help tp poorer pensioners. From October, income support will be raised by L3 a week for a married couple, on top of a rise already planned in April. Pensioners who smoke, however, will have little to celebrate.
By increasing the excise duties on cigarettes and petrol by more than the rate of inflation, Mr Lamont raised L600m to help pay for tax cuts elsewhere. The 13p added to the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost a couple who each smoke 30 cigarettes a day an extra L2.73 a week. Mr Lamont added 10p to a gallon of leaded petrol, but only 5p to unleaded petrol, to encourage more drivers to switch. Duties on drink were raised in line with inflation.
British beer-drinkers now pay 24p in duty on each pint of beer--25 times as much as in France. Duties on wine, spirits and pipe tobacco, in contrast, have fallen by 20-30% in real terms. Traditional Tory vices have become something of a bargain."

""In that case, what are we?"" the bosses of big businesses may be forgiven for asking, as they count their smaller blessings. Mr Lamont's answer would be: ""Tory voters in any case.""
The finances of big firms are healthier than a year ago; and companies will benefit by L350m in 1992-93 from the one-point cut in corporation tax, to 33%, announced in last year's budget. Despite that, big business had pleaded for new capital allowances to encourage investment. That would have cost the exchequer a lot of revenue, would have benefited mostly profitable firms, and probably have done little to spur investment. The chancellor turned a deaf ear.
He decided to leave advance corporation tax (ACT) unchanged, too. Some big firms that pay dividends out of foreign profits have complained they are paying more ACT than they can set against their corporation-tax liability. Mr Lamont sympathised, but said measures would have to wait for a review by the European Commission. Letting big businesses pay VAT each quarter instead of each month will give them a L200m tax cut in 1992-93. The chancellor also helped the car industry (see box). For the rest, he offered help mainly to smaller firms.
Mr Lamont allocated L480m to help keep business rates (property taxes) down. When the uniform business rate was introduced in 1990, ""transitional relief"" was given to firms faced with big increases; this was to be balanced by slowing the pace at which the rates paid by others fell. The new cash will extend the relief, while allowing other bills to fall more quickly.
Exempting cars that are used as capital goods from VAT will help taxi and car-hire firms and driving schools by L50m in 1992-93, and by L100m in 1993-94. Leaving vehicle-excise duty on lorries unchanged (instead of increasing it in line with inflation) helps businesses by a further L30m. And Britain's film industry was given a new tax-break worth L5m in 1992-93.
More small traders will be able to delay VAT payments until they themselves have been paid. Penalties for minor errors in VAT payments are to be cut. More employers will be able to pay income tax and national insurance each quarter rather than each month. To encourage debtors to pay their bills promptly, big firms, often the worst culprits, will have to state in their annual report how quickly they pay up. The abolition of inheritance taxes on most family businesses and some unlisted securities will help smaller firms by about L10m this year.
Mr Lamont has taken away some tax reliefs. The business expansion scheme, for instance, will cease at the end of 1993; Its aim was to attract new capital into risky businesses; in effect it paid outlandish subsidies to property speculators. Requiring banks, brokers and other agents that collect tax on foreign dividends to pay up monthly rather than quarterly will raise L70m. Closing a loophole by which a firm can offset arrears on rent charged among its own subsidiaries against tax will bring in L30m in 1992-93, and an impressive L200m in 1993-94.
On personal taxes, Mr Lamont reaffirmed the goal of a 20% basic rate; for business taxes, there is no such vision. After 13 years of Tory reforms, plenty remains to be done. Anomalies and complexities abound, and the case for a radical overhaul of the entire corporate-tax system is strong. But Mr Lamont's hope appears to be that, after April 9th, normal meddling will resume.
NEW CARS FOR OLD
Sales of new cars in Britain slid last year to just 1.6m, from the record 2.3m in 1989. So the motor industry cried for help--and was answered. The rate of car tax has been cut of by half to 5%; taxi operators, car-hire firms and driving schools get relief from VAT on their vehicles; and capital-allowance limits on business cars have been raised. Many in the industry reckon all this could boost new car sales this year by about 70,000. But a pothole looms: Mr Lamont has tinkered with the company-car perk.
Britain is obsessed with company cars. They account for about 60% of all new cars sold, a far higher proportion than in any other country. The benefit of a company car for private use has been taxed more heavily in recent years. This year Mr Lamont said the tax would rise only in line with inflation. However, another reform could make the company car far less appealing.
There will no longer be a VAT penalty on companies that offer employees a cash alternative to a company car. With an increasing number of two-and-three-car households, thousands of employees may prefer to do without yet another car and take the money instead. Or they might use the cash to buy their own car--not the new Ford, Vauxhall or Rover offered by most firms, but a second-hand model.
Mr Lamont has also adopted a recommendation of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and will look into taxing company cars on the basis of their price. At present company cars costing less than L19,250 ($33,000) are taxed on engine size. This encourages employees to order cars with lots of expensive gadgets. Taxing cars on their value will make company-car drivers a little more fastidious--if they bother to have a company car at all."

This is the time to talk about Margaret Thatcher. Why? Because the start of the official campaign is the right moment to stand back and ask just what sort of Conservative government is now on offer. If John Major wins the election, it will swiftly become clear that Britain is being ruled by a party no longer recognisable as hers. The shift is well enough understood; but not, perhaps, its scale.
It is in neither of the big parties' interest to discuss this. Among the new Tory leadership, analysis of Thatcherism is about as welcome as debate about the cultural value of Madonna (the wrong one) at the Vatican. Labour, meanwhile, would like everyone to talk about Thatcherism--but hates to acknowledge that the Tories are no longer Thatcherite.
This is not a left-right affair. The distinction is between a party that is populist, nationalist and anti-corporatist (the Thatcher party) and one that is mandarin, Europhile and interventionist (the Major one). In the new party, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten, Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Clarke are the politicians best able to articulate its newness. What should they be called? Christian Democrats, say their Thatcherite opponents (though they have less polite words, too). Perhaps ""Social Tories"" is a fair shorthand. If Mr Major wins, his Social Tories talk of a drastic reshuffle that will purge the few remaining Thatcherites in high office. Only Norman Lamont's Treasury will stay, a beleaguered bastion of Thatcherite orthodoxy.
Whitehall's reorganisation would further strengthen the Social Tories. Suppose that, as expected, Mr Major abolished a few smaller departments like energy, employment and transport, and switched their functions to super-departments, such as a new industry department and a bigger environment department.
He would then be able to cut the number of cabinet ministers; power would be concentrated in fewer hands. Whose hands? Mr Heseltine would expect a choice of staying at environment or moving to ""super-industry"". Whichever he didn't take would probably go to Mr Clarke. Mr Hurd would be asked to stay on as foreign secretary and Mr Patten would be an obvious choice as home secretary. They would be the sources of preferment and influence. Any idea that a new intake of young Thatcherite MPS would fail to come under their influence is extremely naive. Unless, that is, the Conservatives are breeding a hitherto-obscure species, the unambitious Member.
Social Toryism, circa 1994, would bear some similarities to 1980s Thatcherism. It would be anti-inflation, if only because the exchange-rate mechanism and the Maastricht conditions for a single currency form a kind of ever-watchful substitute for Mrs Thatcher. It would be a dolots government, not a do-nothing one: her ex-ministers have learnt that good politics means bustle, not torpor.
In other ways, it would be dramatically different. The Social Tories would join a single European currency. And such civilised chaps would, naturally, spend freely. How freely? No British government can now go on a binge, so the answer would be: just freely enough to stop Mr Lamont cutting taxes. They would be less than radical on British Rail and the BBC, while issuing name-badges to most citizens. They would contemplate, sadly, a Scottish parliament but would not contemplate further changes in the welfare state. They would speak often and warmly about manufacturing industry.
Social Toryism may sound like risk-free politics, but would not be. Its keenness to improve public services and its bias to higher spending would naturally tend to drive the opposition (for want of any other agenda) towards constitutional reforms. Labour's younger generation is driving itself there already. This week Gordon Brown broke cover with a speech which attacked the (Labourite) post-1945 settlement. He described Britain's tradition of Crown sovereignty as ""unacceptable"" and made clear his openness to drastic change, including a new voting system and a written constitution.
This was highly significant, for Mr Brown has been a cautiously loyal Kinnockite. His speech, subversive of traditional Labour thinking, would have incurred Neil Kinnock's contempt just a few years ago. Perhaps it would have got him the sack. The cynics will see his demarche as an attempt to position himself for a post-defeat leadership challenge. But the new agenda will also matter if Labour does well. In a hung parliament, a party which took to heart Mr Brown's speech would be virtually indistinguishable from the Liberal Democrats. Throughout Britain, good Social Tories fear the emergence of a unified Lib-Lab opposition. And rightly: it would be formidable.
For Mr Major, the second and further off threat posed by Social Toryism would be the emergence of a challenge from the right. Mrs Thatcher embodied a relatively rare combination of nationalism and free-trade liberalism. In France, Italy and America, the two philosophies are now at war. Without Mrs Thatcher, and with European union, it would be odd if England did not see the emergence of a radical nationalism hostile to the Tory mainstream. If the party loses, then the anti-European nationalists will fight back, blaming the Social Tories for defeat.
The prime minister has a sharp strategic mind and must have thought about the conundrum. This is probably why he has never openly discussed the Christian Democracy that his senior ministers predict he will follow-even privately, even to trusted colleagues. One say: ""When we talk, I tell him my views and he nods and smiles, and I go away feeling warm. But then I think back and realise that he hasn't actually said what he thinks.""
It is just possible that he will have one or two other things on his mind over the next few weeks. But the philosophical direction of a Major administration is hardly a minor matter. Voters have a right to know whether they are being asked to support a radical regime in the Thatcher mould, but with softer edges; or a fervently pro-European strain of Social Toryism. The prime minister should not be allowed to get through the campaign without discussing this more frankly. A rueful smile and a dismissive comment about all that sort of stuff being theoretical will not be enough."

Having long ruled his home market, he is restless; he yearns for fresh conquests. So he plans to build a media empire like none Europe has ever seen. His television stations and film distributors will be scattered across the continent. In Britain he will take on the stuffy media establishment. Then, perhaps, Hollywood. He also owns a web of private companies--supermarkets, a football team. Yet troubles loom: his debts are big, his hubris bigger; he may have run foul of the law.
The mogul? No, not a mid-1980s Robert Maxwell, or Rupert Murdoch. Instead he is Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Italy's Fininvest, Europe's second-biggest media conglomerate after Germany's Bertelsmann. During the 1980s Mr Berlusconi concentrated on his businesses in Italy, where he used a shrewd strategy and tight links with politicians to dominate the country's exploding media market. Now he is striding on to the world stage. But rivals and regulators in other European countries are fighting him, his Italian base is in jeopardy, and the uncanny parallels with other once-mighty media magnates have sceptics wondering whether he, too, is headed for a fall.
By the end of the year, Mr Berlusconi hopes to have a stake in each of Europe's five largest television markets. Already he competes in three of them. Next he plans to turn round La Cinq, a bankrupt French channel of which he owns 25%, and invade Britain by winning the right to run a new terrestrial service, Channel 5. He also aims to break Hollywood's hold on Europe's film market. He has set up production companies in Hollywood and Rome and is building a film-distribution network across Europe.
Mr Berlusconi's audacity has been evident since he first started using money made as a property developer to take on Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI), Italy's state-owned monopoly broadcaster. Barred by law from setting up a national channel showing live programming, in 1980 he cobbled together a network of local stations, called Canale 5, to broadcast mainly American fare such as ""Dallas"". To make Canale 5 look like a national network, he sent a fleet of motorbikers round the country delivering videotapes to local stations to be broadcast simultaneously. Canale 5 was a hit.
Since then Mr Berlusconi has acquired two more national channels and added newspapers, book and magazine publishers, a media-buying agency, film and video production and distribution companies, and cinemas. Together with Fininvest's non-media firms--in financial services, insurance and retailing--they make up Italy's third-biggest private-sector company. Last year the group's sales totalled 10.4 trillion lire ($9.1 billion), half of it from media.
In the best Italian tradition, Fininvest is a secretive, family-controlled company. Because the group's finances are shrouded in mystery, critics suspect Mr Berlusconi is hiding something and that his position may be as precarious as some of his fallen rivals. Mr Berlusconi insists not. As evidence, he cites his bankers' willingness to finance fully half of his recent acquisitions, including Standa, a big retailer, and Mondadori, a big publishing house he took over last year after a long battle with Carlo De Benedetti.
Perhaps his bankers have been too enthusiastic. Mediobanca, an Italian merchant bank, reckons Fininvest's net debt has soared from 345 billion lire in 1987 to 3 trillion lire in 1990. The company disputes this, claiming its net debt in 1990 was 2.4 trillion lire and that last year, after assuming some of Mondadori's debts, it was 2.9 trillion lire.
Either way, the number is huge. But Mr Berlusconi is at pains to stress he is no Maxwell. His debts, he says, are under control: he will sell no business to reduce them, though he may float bits of the group in two years' time. One Milan financier who knows Fininvest well agrees, citing its solid assets, profits in 1990 of 190 billion lire (a 34% increase on 1989) and strong cash flow from advertising sales in Italy.
Fininvest's place in the Italian media market is indeed enviable. Last year the group gobbled up around 28% of the 9.5 trillion lire spent on total media advertising (see chart on next page).(Chart omitted) It has a whopping 55% of television-advertising revenues. But Mr Berlusconi's cash cow may be about to run dry. After a decade of real growth of 15% a year, Italian ad-spending rose last year by just 3%, and is unlikely to do much better for a while. Television is holding up better than print, but it too has slowed.
More worrying for Mr Berlusconi is a 1990 media law containing anti-monopoly provisions that have made him limit his stake in Telepiu, a pay-TV channel, to 10%, and sell his newspapers. By August he must sell the last one: Il Giornale, a Milan daily.
That may not be all. Recently 13 Italian newspapers filed a complaint with media regulators against Mr Berlusconi. They allege that Fininvest's dominance of the television market has let it slash prices offered to advertisers so much that newspapers can not compete; and that it compels advertisers who buy time on its channels to take space in Mondadori's magazines too. They want Mr Berlusconi out of publishing.
Mr Berlusconi says he is not ""dumping"" ads; competition from subsidised RAI has made him cut prices. Nor does he make advertisers do anything: the accusation is ""a total invention"" of his competitors. Still, he admits that cut-rate ad packages were offered last year as ""Christmas presents"" to customers. This, he says, will not happen again. Officials will soon make a final ruling on whether Mr Berlusconi has to sell his magazines. On March 7th newspaper reporters trying to sway them went on strike to protest against Mr Berlusconi's supposed media monopoly. Days later journalists at the state-owned television and radio stations did the same.
Mr Berlusconi cannot afford too many troubles at home because his adventures abroad will be costly. Start with Paris, where last month he put forward a FFr1.5 billion ($270m) rescue package for La Cinq. When Mr Berlusconi launched the channel in 1985, he was ridiculed by French critics for showing too much downmarket Americana. In 1990 Hachette, a French media giant and a partner in La Cinq, gained control by pledging to restore ""quality programming"". The channel went bust.
Mr Berlusconi is again being savaged by France's media bigwigs. Andre Rousselet, boss of Canal Plus, a pay-TV channel, has accused Mr Berlusconi of milking profits from La Cinq by selling it over-priced Fininvest programming. On the contrary, says Mr Berlusconi, he has pumped FFr1 billion into the station. His competitors, he says, have scared off potential French partners for the rescue by accusing them of being ""collaborationists"". Now he is trying to assemble a consortium of European banks and small investors to finance the deal. But the CSA, France's broadcasting watchdog, may yet decide to reject Mr Berlusconi's plan.
Britain may prove no more hospitable. Mr Berlusconi was frustrated from bidding for one of the highly profitable British regional channels auctioned last year by a vague ""quality threshold"" known to those who concocted the rules as the ""FOB"" clause--for ""fuck off Berlusconi"".
Soon Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) will accept bids for Channel 5. Mr Berlusconi's will probably be among them. Because of competition from satellite and cable, and myriad technical difficulties with its launch (set for 1994), Channel 5 will be an expensive affair; indeed, the ITC'S chairman is said to consider it a nightmare. NERA, a London consultancy, reckons that whoever wins will suffer losses of as much as $300m a year until 1997.
Mr Berlusconi's men think it might be worth it. NERA says that, if Channel 5 can withstand big early losses, it might be making profits of nearly $1 billion a year in 2003, when the licence expires. Equally important, a British channel would make it easier for Mr Berlusconi to employ some of Britain's many independent television producers. Like his investment in Hollywood--$110m last year for six movies--it is all part of a strategy to create the first European-based, vertically integrated film-and-television empire.
It might work. European media companies have often foundered on parochialism. Mr Berlusconi will not. His problem is hubris. Asked why a media company should also own supermarkets and insurance companies, Mr Berlusconi argues his name is a brand that can be stretched across a range of businesses. The claim sounds preposterous. But in Italy some think it is true. His ownership Of AC Milan, a top football team, has made him a pop hero. A recent poll of teenagers found Sua Emittenza (""his transmittence"") more popular than Jesus Christ. Presumably his bankers take some comfort from that."

The assets at stake in America's ten biggest bankruptcies last year were worth more than $50 billion (see table). (Table omitted) In Eastern Europe, rules that allow the assets of failing firms to be allocated to better uses will be critical to economic recovery. But what rules should the ex-communist economies adopt? Westen countries have a plethora of conflicting bankruptcy codes. A new idea, proposed by Philippe Aghion of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Oliver Hart of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and John Moore of the London School of Economics*, could make better sense than any of these--and not just in Eastern Europe. They began by examining the flaws in the existing western systems.
First, bankruptcy rules may not keep losses of lenders and shareholders as low as possible. Britain's receivership, and chapter seven of America's Bankruptcy Reform Act, require an outsider--usually a judge or an accountant--to run the firm, with the aim of raising as much money as possible, probably by selling bits of the firm or by closing it down. Any money raised is distributed to creditors according to ""strict legal priority""; senior creditors (usually banks which have made low-risk, secured loans) are paid first, then junior creditors (unsecured lenders and trade creditors). Only when all creditors have been paid do ordinary shareholders get what is left, which is often peanuts.
Usually the firm's top managers are fired and the firm is broken up. That is fine if the firm's structure or management caused it to go bust. But if the reason was plain bad luck, getting rid of managers robs the firm of their experience and inside knowledge and might leave it worth less to creditors than if its managers had been left in place during restructuring. America's chapter 11 does just this. Managers win protection from creditors, giving them time to think up a rescue plan. But chapter 11 is flawed, because it often favours shareholders and junior creditors at the expense of senior creditors.
The reason is simple: shareholders and junior debtors, who may deserve to lose all their money, can vote on the rescue package as well as senior creditors. It is true that the judge who presides over the negotiations is supposed to ensure fairness, but because shareholders and creditors have to agree what the restructured firm is worth, rather than simply dividing up a pile of cash as under chapter seven, there is plenty of room for disagreement. And time is against senior creditors: firms in chapter 11 do not pay interest, and hefty legal bills eat into the firms' value. So senior creditors often settle for far less than their due, simply to save time.
This is bad for the economy: if managers know they can keep their jobs and not pay back their debts, they are unlikely to borrow wisely; if investors cannot be sure of getting back what they are due, they will lend less and charge more.
The bankruptcy procedure proposed by Messrs Aghion, Hart and Moore is designed both to allow good managers to keep their jobs and to ensure that investors get what is due to them. First, all the firm's debts are cancelled. Then a judge or other arbitrator is appointed to allocate ownership of the firm among shareholders and creditors on the basis of strict legal priority: senior creditors would get shares, the firm's junior creditors and original shareholders options to buy those shares.
The judge also solicits bids for the firm. Meanwhile, investors may trade their new shares and options. Bidders for control of the firm may offer cash, simply a promise to run the firm better or a mixture of both. The firm's new shareholders vote on the bids made to the judge; the firm then leaves bankruptcy.
Shares and options would be given to investors using a clever scheme first suggested by Lucian Rebchuk of Harvard Law School in 1988**. All the new equity is issued to the firm's senior creditors, subject only to the condition that, if junior creditors agree to pay what is owed to the senior creditors, the senior creditors must hand over their stakes to them. if, say, senior creditors are owed $1m, and in new shares are issued, junior creditors have the right to buy the shares from senior creditors at a price of $1 each.
Likewise, the firm's original shareholders are given an option to buy the shares for a price equal to the amount owed to all other creditors combined. So if junior creditors are owed $2m, and senior creditors are owed $1m, the original shareholders can buy new shares in what was once their company for $3 each.
This way, all classes of creditor and the original shareholders have the same incentives--to accept a bid for control of the firm that maximises its value. If shareholders or junior creditors think the firm is worth more than is due to senior creditors, they will simply exercise their options. Imagine that junior creditors think the firm is worth $1.5m. They would buy all the shares, and so recover $500,000 of their original investment. If they think the firm is worth less than $1m, they will not exercise their options, but simply swallow their losses instead.
This may seem too complex. Why not let creditors and shareholders choose between selling the firm and dividing up the cash, or accepting a restructuring plan offered either by existing managers or by an an outside management team? Once creditors opt not to liquidate a firm, arguments about the size and distribution of equity stakes in a restructured firm, and who will run it, are likely to be as prolonged as the squabbles which characterise most chapter 11 bankruptcies.
Is it necessary for the judge to referee an auction for control of the firm? Surely by trading the new equity and options, the firm or management team which values the bankrupt firm the most will be able to buy a controlling stake, and so carry out its rescue plan? Perhaps so. But Messrs Aghion, Hart and Moore doubt whether capital markets are efficient enough to produce a timely change of control in such cases, even in America and Britain, never mind Eastern Europe.

The authors of the Community's founding Treaty of Rome thought so 35 years ago, when they put antitrust in the commission's hands to keep it away from national politicians. But the creation of a single European market has turned the commission itself into a political battleground, and many of the fiercest battles have been over competition policy. A series of controversial decisions by Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, and a handful of botched court cases have increased support for a separate antitrust authority independent of both the commission and national governments.
The Treaty of Rome gives the commission the authority to crack down on price-fixing, cartels and other anti-competitive behaviour by firms that operate across the Community's national borders, and to an government subsidies that distort trade. Since September 1990 the commission has also had the power to veto large cross-border mergers and takeovers.
As firms and governments have jostled for advantage in the emerging single market, the whole subject of competition regulation has become fraught. In the most recent case, the German government wrote an angry letter to the commission about its decision to allow Alcatel, a French telecoms firm, to take over AEG Kabel, part of the Daimler-Benz group. German officials, saying they were not properly consulted, complain that the case, which will give the merged company 52% of the German market for some types of cable, should have been referred to Germany's own independent competition authority, the federal cartel office.
This is the second time in three months that a commission decision in favour of French firms has provoked howls. Last November the commission allowed Credit Lyonnais, a state-owned bank, to invest FFr2.5 billion ($452m) in Usinor Sacilor, a state-owned steelmaker. German and British steel makers were furious, complaining that the investment was a disguised government subsidy.
Some lawyers in Brussels wonder whether the commission is trying to be nice to France because some earlier decisions had produced similar French outrage. These included the commission's demand that Renault, a State-owned car maker, repay money given to it by the French government in 1990; and the commission's veto in October of a joint takeover of De Havilland, a Canadian aircraft maker, by France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia, both state-owned firms.
The De Havilland case split the commission, pitting Sir Leon against Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, who supported the merger. Mr Bangemann not only openly criticised Sir Leon's decision, but also complained that consultation procedures within the commission were inadequate. These were made more explicit last month, and now require Sir Leon to follow a detailed set of rules before making a decision on mergers.
Sir Leon suffered another setback last month, when the European Court of justice overturned two of his more controversial decisions on technical grounds. One required British Aerospace to return L44m ($78m) in cash ""sweeteners"" it had received from the British government in 1988 to buy Rover, a state-owned car maker. The other required the Dutch government to allow courier firms to compete with the country's postal monopoly. On March 11th a determined Sir Leon announced that he would launch yet another investigation of the payment to British Aerospace.
Since Sir Leon has had to wheel and deal to get his decisions past his fellow commissioners, and has had several of those decisions criticised, support has grown for an independent agency to rule on competition cases. It might be like Germany's cartel office, which in recent years has had only one of its decisions reversed by the German government.
Located away from Brussels, the agency would publish its decisions before submitting them to the commission for approval. If the commission overturned an agency decision, it would have to plain publicly why it did so. The idea would be to make it far more difficult for politicians to meddle in competition issues. In a speech on March 5th, Sir Leon opposed the idea. He used the odd argument that the rest of the Community lacks the maturity to make a German-style independent agency work."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224138857/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/42?accountid=14657,"In the euphoria following the sale of his Virgin Music Group to Thorn EMI for L510m ($877m) on March 6th, Richard Branson briefly toyed with the idea of launching a break-up bid for British Airways (BA), his archrival in the airline business. But in the cold light of day, caution prevailed. Instead of bidding for BA, he is busy recruiting new partners to help finance a modest expansion of his own Virgin Atlantic Airways and the introduction of a new type of service for the growing number of budget-conscious business-travellers. In an era of mega-carriers, Mr Branson believes that small upstarts like Virgin can steal the most lucrative bits of the airline business from much bigger airlines.
Virgin Atlantic (the second word may be dropped) began in 1984 with a single, leased Boeing 747 operating between New York and London. The airline now leases eight jets, and last year carried more than 1m passengers on routes that have expanded to Miami, Los Angeles, Boston and Tokyo. Yet Virgin remains a gnat compared with BA, which has more than 200 aircraft and flies about 25m passengers a year.
Virgin Atlantic is part of Voyager Travel Holdings, a private company which is 90% owned by Mr Branson and fellow directors. In the year to July 31st 1991, the airline accounted for 80% of Voyager's L281m sales. The remainder came from hotels and a travel company. With the worldwide slump in air travel and the cost of moving its base from London's Gatwick into BA's backyard at the busier Heathrow airport, Virgin lost money last year. This helped drag Voyager's pre-tax profits down to L775,000, compared with L8.5m the year before. Virgin predicts profits will be L4m this year.
The remaining 10% of Voyager is owned by Seibu Saison, a big Japanese department store and hotel group. Negotiations are being completed for the sale of a further 20% to a group of British institutions, says Mr Branson. This should raise about L55m and help the airline complete its strategy of operating 18 jets by the mid-1990s, flying some 3m passengers to about a dozen destinations. ""The temptation to get any bigger must be resisted,"" insists Mr Branson.
He says Virgin's strategy is to offer passengers direct flights on the busiest routes between a limited number of top destinations. It reckons airport hubs and feeder networks are strictly for the bigger carriers. Yet to survive in its niche Virgin needs governments to support more competition in a notoriously cartelised industry. Even if deregulation creates new opportunities for small carriers, they will still face countless battles. This is because the big established airlines claim so-called ""grandfather rights"" (ie, ""we were here first so nobody else should be allowed in"") over most of the routes and slots available at airports.
Virgin was only able to start flying to Japan after the British government ordered BA to give up slots at Tokyo's congested Narita airport. That soured relations between BA and Virgin. Mr Branson has accused BA of launching a ""dirty tricks"" campaign to discredit Virgin and poach passengers. Although BA denies the allegation, Mr Branson is threatening to lodge an antitrust suit against BA in the American courts.
Mr Branson knows that, however fierce Virgin's rivalry with BA becomes, his airline has to avoid an all-out fares war, which it could only lose. So Virgin competes only partly on price. It tries to offer a more innovative and higher-quality service for a lower fare than its rivals. Up to now, Virgin has provided just two classes of service: economy with more leg-room and seat-back television screens, and ""Upper Class"" with sleeper seats, an airport-limousine service and in-flight masseurs. Essentially first class at business-class fares, Upper Class has been a hit with passengers. ""It is the reason the airline is still around today"" says Mr Branson.
Now Mr Branson plans to launch a third service. Provisionally known as ""Middle Class"", it will offer business-class seating for about the price of a full economy-fare. On most airlines, passengers paying the full economy fare (probably because they booked late or need flexibility to change their fights) sit in the same seats as those using discounted tickets with travel restrictions. Virgin's new class is aimed at travellers on a limited budget seeking a slightly higher level of service than that available in the economy cabin. Eventually, Mr Branson would like to fit each of his jets with three Upper Class cabins, two Middle Class cabins and only one economy section. There is a risk that some current Upper Class passengers could trade down, but Mr Branson is betting that many now travelling economy class on the big airlines will want to trade up--to Virgin."

Computerised databases, information services and electronic mail are still organised in much the same way as the libraries, broadcast networks and postal services that evolved to fit the capabilities of yesterday's technology. But in California--where else?--entrepreneurs are hard at work on something new.
In June the data-ports will open on the first electronic market for information. Called the American Information Exchange (AMIX), and based in Palo Alto, it will act as an electronic trading floor--at first only for Americans, but soon, its founders hope, for the rest of the world as well. Anybody on the system can buy the information he needs or sell the information he possesses (with AMIX taking a 10-40% commission).
AMIX is the brainchild of Phil Salin, who had the idea as an economics student, inspired by the free-market writings of Friedrich von Hayek, an Austrian economist who won the Nobel prize in 1974. In the mid-1980s, when Mr Salin thought his idea might be technologically feasible, he enlisted the financial backing of Autodesk, a Californian software company, to launch AMIX. Mr Salin died in December, but Marc Stiegler, of Autodesk, and Dana Timbrook have taken over the running of the company.
AMIX has been operating experimentally since June 1991. It provides for several sorts of information transaction. At its simplest, it operates much as existing information services do, allowing buyers to browse through descriptions of offerings from information suppliers. But AMIX also goes far beyond this, using computer technology to reverse the usual roles of buyer and seller. On AMIX a buyer will be able to advertise his questions, and sellers will then be able to bring to his attention whichever of their wares they think might fit his needs. If the information has not yet been compiled, AMIX also provides a mechanism for buyer and seller to negotiate a consulting contract to create customised information.
For now, AMIX is trying to increase the variety of information available before opening to the public in June. But to prime the market, it has encouraged information suppliers already recruited to the system to trade among themselves. So Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Development, purveyor of the world's most successful spreadsheet, offers to spend 15 minutes analysing any new business plans. Leading computer-industry analysts such as Esther Dyson and Patty Seybold offer to discuss industry trends, and the developers of AMIX trade bits of software with other American programmers. Prices range from $1 to $2,000 per transaction.
Freed from the constraints of paper, the information on AMIX is already taking a variety of newshapes. One trend is to ""unbundle"" information. Instead of offering, say, market analysis only as a complete report for several thousand dollars a copy, many AMIX suppliers are unbundling their wares so that a buyer can have as much, or as little, information as he wants. Another experiment is to program the computer to lower the price of information automatically as it ages. And alliances are starting to develop between vendors of related information whose products cater for different levels of interest. None of this is impossible on paper, but should be much easier to do electronically.
One big problem facing the ideal of free electronic markets in information is how to let a potential customer know enough about what is available for him to be able to make rational decisions about what to buy. Unlike cars or computers--where one can, at least in theory if not often in practice, know everything about competing products before making a decision on what to buy--it is impossible to have ""perfect information"" in information markets, even in theory. By definition, if you know everything about a piece of information you are thinking of buying, then you do not need to buy it. This means that, in practice, providers of information have to walk a fine line between revealing enough about their goods to sell them and revealing so much that they are no longer worth buying.
Part of AMIX'S solution lies in providing information about the supplier of information, as well as the product itself. Each supplier files a description of his qualifications and experience on to the system. Buyers are also encouraged to record their opinions of products or consultancy services after purchase. Not only can future customers scan these when considering whether to buy a product, they can also scan the same buyer's comments on other products to detect any biases. if every comment this person has made is nasty, his remarks may be ignored by other customers.
If worst comes to worst, AMIX has established procedures to solve disputes about the quality of information supplied by referring them to an independent arbitrator. Each person who signs on to the market agrees to submit to binding arbitration. With that anti-self-destruct mechanism in place, AMIX is free to evolve at its users' whims. It should be a fascinating process. Stay tuned--or plugged in."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224156674/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/44?accountid=14657,"Cash-Laden Japanese shoppers have become famous for caring more about brand names than price tag. But the era of brand snobbery may be coming to an end. Like shoppers in most other countries, millions of Japanese are now scouting for bargains, comparing prices and opting for ""no-brand"" This began even before the Japanese economy's recent slowdown. But if Japan is headed for recession, as many believe, Japanese consumers will become still more price-conscious. That is bad news for the department stares which have long dominated Japanese retailing, as well as importers of luxury goods, whose sales boomed in the 1980s.
Many Japanese consumers have shed their inhibitions about buying a store's own private-label products, which offer good value but little snob appeal. Others are cheerfully accepting shoddier products because of their throw-away prices. An inverted snobbery has even made ""no-brand brands"" popular (see box).
This shift in tastes has been encouraged by new specialised stores--small outlets in the suburbs catering to specific groups of consumers--which have borrowed merchandising and distribution techniques from retailers in America and Europe to offer men's clothing (Aoyama Trading), furniture (Shimachu) and a variety of goods (Mr Max) at cheaper prices.
Unlike Japan's big department stores, these retailers buy their goods direct from manufacturers, saving themselves the wholesaler's mark-up of 5-15%. They also avoid the sale-or-return agreements that have long been standard between other Japanese retailers and manufacturers. That means they have to manage their own inventory, but saves them another 15% on the manufacturer's price.
Nor have specialised retailers tied up huge amounts of money in property, as have many department-store chains. Most rent outlets in suburban shopping malls, staffing them with part-timers. The results are fatter profits. Gross margins at Aoyama Trading, the men's clothing firm, are nearly 50%, estimates Victoria Melendez, an analyst with Jardine Fleming in Tokyo, compared with a margin of less than 35% on men's clothing at Takashimaya, a leading department store. There is an even bigger gap between their overall operating-profit margins: Aoyama Trading's is a healthy 18.6% while Takashimaya struggles along with an anaemic 2.5%.
Ironically, the success of the specialised retailers is partly due to a relaxation of the law restricting the growth of big retailers, which was passed in 1990 largely to help the department stores. These promptly borrowed huge amounts of money to buy land and build new stores just as interest rates rose. Most department-store chains are now tottering under massive bank debts. Most specialised stores, by contrast, have no debt. The law, and the glut of commercial property, have left them free to expand even faster by renting space.
In a bid to win back customers, department stores such as Isetan and Mitsukoshi have rushed to introduce lower-priced brands of their own. But this move has predictably upset their traditional suppliers.
It has also transformed the way the department stores do business. Imported from low-wage factories abroad, own-brand goods are rarely bought on a sale-or-return basis. Having always relied on local manufacturers to manage their inventories for them, few Japanese department stores know how to do it themselves.
It may take several years for them to install a master the sophisticated electronic point-of-sale equipment and inventory-control systems which the specialised stores already own, and which retailers in America and Europe have been perfecting over the past few years.
THE ANTI-BRAND BRAND
Try to imagine (if you are not one already) that you are a 22-year-old woman office worker living at home with your parents in Japan. You spend most of your Y160,000 ($1,200) monthly pay packet on yourself. Elegant in your Jean Paul Gaultier dress, Hermes scarf draped casually around the neck, gold Cartier watch on your wrist and Chanel handbag dangling from the shoulder, you step jauntily into the office lift. Seconds later the doors open and--horrors--in steps another lady decked out in precisely the same designer-brand uniform, then another, and yet another. Many Tokyo office buildings are now full of young Japanese women who dress exactly alike.
Jaded by the ubiquity of fancy brand names, many of Japan's conspicuous consumers are now turning to ""no-brand"" goods in what looks like a forlorn attempt to display some individuality. The trend-setter has been Seibu, a department-store chain that goes after the affluent young. Inside Seibu's flagship store in Tokyo, one section sells only Mujirushi ryohin (""no brand/good quality"") products. Their labels say only what materials are used and the country of origin--mostly China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand or India. The products are easy to spot because of their simple design, plain colours, high quality and reasonable pricing.
Seibu's parent, the Saison group, originally developed the no-brand idea for tinned food and household items for its Seiyu supermarkets. Two years ago the group established a separate company, Ryohin Keikaku, to handle an expanded line of Muji goods, which today includes 1,800 items.
Ryohin Keikaku now has 201 outlets in Japan and two overseas. One of its foreign stores in a joint venture with Wing On in Hong Kong. Another is a joint venture with Liberty in London's Carnaby Street, where the firm's no-brand goods sell for an astonishing 70% more than they do in Japan. Ryohin Keikaku plans to open 20-30 more outlets in East Asia over the next few years, if Muji products prove as popular abroad as they have been at home. Many fashionable young Japanese would not be caught dead in anything else."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224164665/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/45?accountid=14657,"The chaebol--the giant conglomerates that dominate South Korea's economy--are doing it again. They have a penchant for plunging into industries in which they have no experience to emerge, a few years later, as vigorous competitors, usually at the low-margin, commodity end of the market. Over the past two decades they have pulled off this trick in steel, shipbuilding, semiconductors and, less successfully, in cars. This time their target is petrochemicals.
South Korea enjoys no discernible advantages in producing petrochemicals. The two key factors needed to succeed in the industry are access to a guaranteed and competitively priced supply of the refined oil used as a feedstock, and cheap capital. The chaebol have neither. South Korea has no oil and only limited refining capacity for imported oil. Worse, its stockmarket is woefully underdeveloped. To raise large amounts of money, its big companies have to borrow long-term from banks at punishingly high interest rates.
None of these disadvantages has deterred the chaebot. In 1989 Yukong and Daelim expanded their two plants that make naphtha (the basic material for petrochemicals), then the only ones in the country. Lucky Goldstar, Samsung, Hyundai and Korea Petrochemical Corporation each opened a plant to make ethylene (a derivative of naphtha) in 1991. Honam and Han Yang will follow suit this year. Each of these new sites is immense. ""We never plan industrial projects here looking at the domestic market. The scale is too small,"" explains Park Ungsoh, president of Samsung's petrochemical subsidiary, which has invested $3 billion in its naphtha plant.
Korea's capacity to produce ethylene--the base for many petrochemical derivatives--will have soared from a mere 505,000 tonnes a year in 1989 to an estimated 3.2m tonnes by the end of this year. ""By 1993 the South Korean petrochemical industry is expected to be about half the size of Japan's, measured by ethylene output,"" says Terry Le Roux, the roanager of Chem Systems East Asia, a consulting firm.
The big conglomerates' rationale for their lemming-like plunge into the industry is that it is long overdue. They argue that South Korea is growing too rapidly to rely entirely on petrochemical imports. Besides, they say, the outlook for the industry is good: world demand is growing and East Asia's share of that demand is increasing. By 2000, for example, Chem Systems expects the volume of world demand for ethylene to rise by about 50% from 1990 levels and demand in East Asia to rise by 150%.
Unfortunately, firms in Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are also looking at the same numbers. Each country plans to build one plant before 1995. China will build three. This new output will reduce the potential market for Korean exports. Now these other countries have shelved further investment in petrochemicals, reasoning that, at least for the next three years, it will be much cheaper to import chemicals from desperate Korean producers than to make them domestically. Singapore, which has long been the centre of Asia's oil industry and has produced petrochemicals since 1984, is taking a far more cautious attitude, helping established oil and petrochemical companies to expand their existing operations gradually.
Some western rivals sneer at the lack of planning behind the Korean decision to move into petrochemicals, charging that fear of being left out and ""me-tooism"" were the driving forces behind their investments. Others are less sure that the chaebol have made a mistake. Paul Beale of FCI (Xylenes and Polyesters) Ltd, a consulting firm, believes that the conglomerates may lose money in the short run simply because so many of them have invested in petrochemicals at the same time but that, in the long run, the rewards could be handsome. ""This is the long-term pattern for base commodities--you make money only occasionally, but when you do it is big money,"" says Mr Beale. Petrochemicals are not a ""game for the faint-hearted,"" he observes.
Undaunted by the prospect of a glut of petrochemical capacity, Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo have already announced that, when the government lifts its restrictions on new entrants to the oil business in 1994, they will each put $1 billion into oil refineries."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136073/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/46?accountid=14657,"THE Tokyo stockmarket began falling more than two years ago. Its value is down by almost 50%. But only now are there unmistakable signs of panic. Investors are worried by an economy slowing far faster than most expected, increasingly visible distress in the financial system, an apparently bottomless property market, and a growing realisation that the Ministry of Finance has lost control of events.
The latest blow came on March 11th when Daiwa Securities, Japan's second-largest securities firm, announced that it would pay Y73.5 billion ($553m) to settle lawsuits brought by Tokyu Department Store and four other companies. Daiwa faces a potential maximum loss on two other pending cases of Y13 billion. It said that it expects to report a net loss for the year through March of Y43 billion, its first since the 1960s. Daiwa's president, Masahiro Dozen, said he would resign.
The shock stems not only from the amount of money involved, which could equal 8% of Daiwa's shareholders' funds. The Tokyu case involves the same sort of window-dressing which forced the much smaller Cosmo Securities to announce on February 24th a net loss of Y36 billion from an out-of-court settlement with a company called Skylark. It suggests that other brokers may also be in trouble--and that despite last summer's scandals the finance ministry knew and countenanced the practice.
Tobashi is the name that Japanese give to the common trick of shifting investments from one account to another before the end of a reporting period, to avoid having to admit a loss. In this case Daiwa is said to have passed a package of securities to Tokyu in August at a price three times what they were really worth, with an agreement to repurchase them later which then fell through.
Few doubt that the finance ministry has known for years about tobashi. Yet it failed to blow the whistle last summer, when it was cracking down on the compensation of clients for losses, and has failed to do so since. The Daiwa deal, like Cosmo's, is recent. That the ministry has chosen to keep quiet doubtless stems from fear that, if assets are not surreptitiously shuffled, disclosed investment losses would cause panic and further Falls in the stockmarket. Yet last summer's scandals have made a difference in one important respect. Disgruntled investors are now more apt to seek legal redress against brokers that let them down.
The Daiwa case also lends credibility to persistent rumours that brokers face liabilities running into trillions of yen, as a result of lawsuits arising from repurchase agreements that have one wrong. Some reckon there are perhaps 350 tobashi lawsuits pending. Daiwa denies that there are further cases waiting to explode (it had previously agreed to pay Y35 billion to another company in the Tokyu group, Tokyu Land). But what about others? The financial rumour-mill puts Daiwa's tobashi liabilities at up to Y800 billion. Yamaichi, Japan's fourth-largest broker, is said to be on the hook for some Y400 billion. All this has caused brokers' shares to weaken further. Daiwa's fell by 8% on March 11th. Shares in Nomura, Japan's biggest securities house, dropped by 7% to Y1,160, 79% lower than the price in April 1987.
It is not just securities firms' shares that are falling. The Topix index, a broad measure equivalent to America's Standard & Poors 500, closed at 1,472 on March 12th, its lowest point since November 1986. Shares in NEC, a leading blue chip, are now trading at prices last seen in 1983. The more widely quoted Nikkei share average, by contrast, closed on March 12th more than 340 points above its October 1990 low of 20,221. But the Topix is a better indicator of market health.
The Topix index includes more companies (1,222, to the Nikkei's 225) and is weighted by market capitalisation. The Nikkei is a simple average. If a share worth Y6,000 goes up 1%, it has the same impact on the index as a 10% rise in a share worth Y600, regardless of relative market capitalisations. This means that the Nikkei can be manipulated easily. Index arbitragers (mainly foreign) have been propping up the Nikkei, contrary to the usual allegations (see box on next page). The Nikkei is the basis of the most popular futures contract; arbs have been selling relatively overvalued futures and buying undervalued shares.
Another reason why the Topix has fared worse than the Nikkei is that financial companies make up 28% of it, compared with only 11% of the Nikkei. Investors are now shunning banks' and brokers' shares. They have well-founded concerns about brokers' legal liabilities and banks! bad debts. They are also giving up hope on the domestic economy more generally. Company profits are now expected to decline in the fiscal year to March 1993. This would mark the third consecutive year in which earnings have declined, the first such sequence since 1945. For shares with no appreciable dividend yield to make them look attractive, the collapse in earnings is disastrous.
The clearest confirmation so far of economic weakness came on March 6th, with the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of companies' short-term business outlook. It reflected a mood of pervasive gloom. Manufacturing companies' capital spending is expected to decline in the coming fiscal year by 8%. Industrial production is likely to have fallen by 4% in the three months to March, the biggest decrease since 1975. Consumer spending is also weakening, and the volume of retail sales is falling.
The slowdown is especially galling to businessmen who kept investing because they believed the government's rosy economic forecasts. The authorities face growing pressure to ease monetary and fiscal policy. Earlier this month Shin Kanemaru, a leading figure in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said publicly that politicians had the power to sack the central-bank governor, Yasushi Mieno, if he does not cut interest rates more enthusiastically.
Mr Kanemaru's outburst may have made it harder for the central bank to give him what he wants, for fear of appearing to be the politicians' lapdog. But he has a point--or rather, two. The Bank of Japan is by no stretch of the imagination independent. And its monetary easing has failed to ignite monetary growth and bank lending, both of which are running at record lows. Lending grew at an annualised rate of only 4.1% in February, partly because real interest rates have not declined as much as nominal ones, due to falling inflation. Real long-term rates are rising.
A long-expected, and consequently much-discounted, cut of half a percentage point in the official discount rate (ODR) to 4% would now do little to revive either the stockmarket or monetary growth. That is why further or larger cuts now look likely. Chris Turner, who watches the Bank of Japan for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, believes that the central bank has yet to realise the seriousness of the slowdown. He reckons the ODR will be at 3% by September, even if it means letting the yen, already weak, slide further. Whether Mr Mieno will still have a job by then is another matter."

Its value is down by almost 50%. But only now are there unmistakable signs of panic. Investors are worried by an economy slowing far faster than most expected, increasingly visible distress in the financial system, an apparently bottomless property market, and a growing realisation that the Ministry of Finance has lost control of events.
The latest blow came on March 11th when Daiwa Securities, Japan's second-largest securities firm, announced that it would pay Y73.5 billion ($553m) to settle lawsuits brought by Tokyu Department Store and four other companies. Daiwa faces a potential maximum loss on two other pending cases of Y13 billion. it said that it expects to report a net loss for the year through March of Y43 billion, its first since the 1960s. Daiwa's president, Masahiro Dozen, said he would resign.
The shock stems not only from the amount of money involved, which could equal 8% of Daiwa's shareholders' funds. The Tokyu case involves the same sort of window-dressing which forced the much smaller Cosmo Securities to announce on February 24th a net loss of Y36 billion from an out-of-court settlement with a company called Skylark. It suggests that other brokers may also be in trouble--and that despite last summer's scandals the finance ministry knew and countenanced the practice.
Tobashi is the name that Japanese give to the common trick of shifting investments from one account to another before the end of a reporting period, to avoid having to admit a loss. In this case Daiwa is said to have passed a package of securities to Tokyu in August at a price three times what they were really worth, with an agreement to repurchase them later which then fell through.
Few doubt that the finance ministry has known for years about tobashi. Yet it failed to blow the whistle last summer, when it was cracking down on the compensation of clients for losses, and has failed to do so since. The Daiwa deal, like Cosmo's, is recent. That the ministry has chosen to keep quiet doubtless stems from fear that, if assets are not surreptitiously shuffled, disclosed investment losses would cause panic and further falls in the stockmarket. Yet last summer's scandals have made a difference in one important respect. Disgruntled investors are now more apt to seek legal redress against brokers that let them down.
The Daiwa case also lends credibility to persistent rumours that brokers face liabilities running into trillions of yen, as a result of lawsuits arising from repurchase agreements that have gone wrong. Some reckon there are perhaps 350 tobashi lawsuits pending. Daiwa denies that there are further cases waiting to explode (it had previously agreed to pay Y3.5 billion to another company in the Tokyu group, Tokyu Land). But what about others? The financial rumour-mill puts Daiwa's tobashi liabilities at up to Y800 billion. Yamaichi, Japan's fourth-largest broker, is said to be on the hook for some Y400 billion. All this has caused brokers' shares to weaken further. Daiwa's fell by 8% on March 11th. Shares in Nomura, Japan's biggest securities house, dropped by 7% to Y1,160, 79% lower than the price in April 1987.
It is not just securities firms' shares that are failing. The Topix index, a broad measure equivalent to America's Standard & Poors 500, closed at 1,472 on March 12th, its lowest point since November 1986. Shares in NEC, a leading blue chip, are now trading at prices last seen in 1983. The more widely quoted Nikkei share average, by contrast, closed on March 12th more than 340 points above its October 1990 low of 20,221. But the Topix is a better indicator of market health.
The Topix index includes more companies (1,222, to the Nikkei's 225) and is weighted by market capitalisation. The Nikkei is a simple average. if a share worth Y6,000 goes up by 1%, it has the same impact on the index as a 10% rise in a share worth Y600, regardless of relative market capitalisations. This means that the Nikkei can be manipulated easily. Index arbitragers (mainly foreign) have been propping up the Nikkei, contrary to the usual allegations (see box on next page). The Nikkei is the basis of the most popular futures contract; arbs have been selling relatively overvalued futures and buying undervalued shares.
Another reason why the Topix has fared worse than the Nikkei is that financial companies make up 28% of it, compared with only 11% of the Nikkei.

BACK TO THE BAD OLD DAYS
Japan's increasingly fearful financial regulators are introducing new rules in a misguided attempt to solve two misperceived problems. First, they are trying to dampen foreign brokers' lucrative futures-arbitrage trading--though this is unlikely to mean more business for Japanese brokers; merely less business all around. Second, they want to revive domestic brokers' bad old manipulative habits--though this will not do much to help the sick stockmarket in the long run. These changes are being effected or mooted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Stock Exchange and the Japan Securities Dealers Association, all under guidance from the finance ministry.
In the matter of gaijin-bashing, Japanese brokers and finance-ministry officials (wrongly, but perhaps sincerely) blame foreign futures arbitrage for the stockmarket's woes. Futures traders face attack on several fronts.
Fixed commissions on derivatives trading are to be doubled, from March 23rd. This follows an earlier attempt to shame arbitragers by disclosure. Since the beginning of February the names of the 20 firms with the greatest turnover in futures and options have been disclosed daily. Once a week the 15 firms with the biggest net long and net short positions in futures are also disclosed. The top 15 net shorts are nearly always foreign firms, the net longs Japanese brokers.
Foreign firms were first informed of more serious threats to arbitrage at a meeting called by the Tokyo Stock Exchange on March 2nd. The first is to change the settlement of futures. The Nikkei contract now expires every three months (next on March 13th) at a ""special quotation price""--the price at which the Nikkei's component shares opened that morning. The authorities want the settlement price to reflect the average daily closing during the preceding week. This will make it harder to unwind positions.
A second mooted change would require foreign brokers to disclose proprietary futures trading by overseas affiliates. Foreign securities firms find this downright offensive.
Third, and most controversial, the Tokyo Stock Exchange threatens to impose stiffer capital backing for index-arbitrage trading. At present, firms must show capital only against net positions; the exchange talks of backing long and short positions separately. This would undermine the economics of arbitrage and would move more trading offshore to Singapore, where a Nikkei futures contract is also traded. Volume there has already begun to rise at the expense of Osaka, the contract's home in Japan.
Other changes to be announced this month also seem aimed at shifting market share from foreign to Japanese brokers. One is to abolish a 1991 rule against share-price ramping, which forbids a broker to account for more than 30% of trading in a share in any month. Many think the finance ministry has already indicated, via the usual nonverbal grunt, that the rule is dead, citing a recent flurry of speculative trading in AIDS-related drugs stocks.
A second change would drop the 15-minute rule that bans brokers from dealing in shares for their own accounts in the last 15 minutes of daily trading. This too was to discourage manipulation.
Some foreign brokers are disposed to fight the changes as discriminatory. Officials would do well to rethink them for other reasons. The share purchases of foreign arbs are one of the Nikkei's few props these days. If they are knocked out, share prices have only one direction in which to go."

Though Mr Milken admits to no responsibility for the thrifts mess, the Treasury will nonetheless get $500m of the total from the ""global settlement"" to help cover the costs of dealing with failed savings and loan associations. It will surely not be long before some smooth-talking lawyer argues that, if the government itself reckons junk bonds caused the thrifts debacle, then lawyers and other professional advisers are less to blame for it.
In recent months the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), Timothy Ryan, has argued that lawyers and accountants must bear significant responsibility for the actions of their thrift clients. He is now putting his argument to the test of law. That is one reason why a dribble of civil professional-liability cases against law and accountancy firms is fast turning into a flood. Another is that there is a three-year statute of limitations on government suits in connection with insolvent thrifts; the first big batch of failures occurred in the first quarter of 1989.
The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), which has handled the liquidation of the 550 or so thrifts that have failed since the beginning of 1989, reckons it will have filed lawsuits involving around 200 professional-liability claims by the end of this year. Three-fifths of them are against outside professional advisers, and the bulk will be lodged by the end of March.
The agency recovered $109m from 91 out-of-court settlements last year, as well as passing 747 cases to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. This year the regulators have taken on hundreds of lawyers and are seeking billions of dollars in damages. Their most appetising targets are the big law and accountancy firms, which often prefer to pay up without having to admit guilt, rather than risk having their clients evaporate from under them.
Lawyers were shocked last week when the Office of Thrift Supervision forced one of New York's better-known law firms into just such a choice. Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler were lawyers to the Lincoln Savings & Loan, the biggest failed thrift to date and once run by Charles Keating, who was convicted of securities fraud last year. The OTS sought $250m in damages from the firm, alleging that its lawyers had repeatedly misled thrift examiners by overstating Lincoln's worth and obstructed regulators trying to shut the thrift down, thereby increasing the final cost to the taxpayer of doing so.
What startled other lawyers too was the way in which the OTS broke new legal ground. It sought to use against thrifts' professional advisers the powers granted it in the 1989 thrift bail-out act to freeze financial assets before a case goes to trial. The OTS applied to the court for an order to freeze the assets of Kaye, Scholer and those of its partners. This increased the pressure on Kaye, Scholer to settle rapidly, as its credit threatened to dry up and its clients to desert. Six days after the suit was filed, the firm agreed to pay $41m over five years and to abide by certain other restrictions.
Some lawyers also fret that the government is using this case (and 25 more that the government is likely to bring this year against other law firms) to redefine the traditional relationship between lawyers and their clients. They claim that the authorities are seeking to emphasise lawyers' duty to the public, when they represent clients before federal agencies such as banking regulators or the Securities and Exchange Commission, at the expense of their obligation to act as advocates.
The question of where the main obligation of lawyers (or accountants) lies is bound to get an airing in a suit that is due to be heard in federal court in Arizona from March 17th. Lincoln's bondholders have charged leading firms in both professions--including Arthur Andersen, Arthur Young (now Ernst & Young) and Touche Ross (now Deloitte & Touche), among the Big Six accountancy firms, as well as Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, America's second-largest law firm--with professional negligence and fraud in what promises to be a widely followed case.
The government will get another crack at Lincoln's accountants when its own case comes to trial, probably this autumn. Most of the big accountancy firms have already faced suits in connection with their auditing of thrifts. Coopers & Lybrand agreed out of court last year to pay the government $20m for its role in advising Silverado, a Denver thrift. Under a more recent provisional settlement, Arthur Andersen has agreed to fork out $40m-60m for work that it did at Lincoln.
But accountancy firms have come up against nothing as big as the two suits filed by the RTC at the beginning of March, against KPMG Peat Marwick and Deloitte & Touche in connection with the failures of Hill Financial and Otero Savings respectively. In total, the government is seeking $250m in damages.
Last year Laventhol & Horwath, one of the largest accountancy firms outside the Big Six, went bust, in part because of the cost of the thrift-malpractice suits it faced. Others could follow if they lose big cases. The accountants' trade press is full of articles about sheltering personal assets and the fine print of liability-insurance policies. Many accountants are beginning to lobby for the right to form limited-liability companies in place of their traditional partnerships. The threat of expensive lawsuits does concentrate the mind."

Countries ranging from Poland to Portugal are rushing to open their stock exchanges, scrap restrictive practices and bring in new technology. In the tumult, not enough attention has been paid to one fundamental question: whether securities are best traded on a quote-driven or an order-driven market. The answer could be crucial to the future of stock exchanges, above all in Europe.
In a quote-driven (or ""dealership"") market, market-making intermediaries quote prices, usually on screens, at which they undertake to buy or sell securities up to a certain size of deal. Investors choose the best quote; the screen may display this automatically. They can also negotiate with market-makers on price or quantity; sometimes they do better than quoted prices. Examples include London's SEAQ system and America's NASDAQ.
In an order-driven (or ""auction"") system, investors submit buy and sell orders, generally through an intermediary. Usually they add a ""limit order"" setting bounds for the price at which they want the deal done. The orders are matched against each other in a centralised auction that is often automated and continuous through the day. Toronto's CATS and Paris's CAC are both auction systems. So are those adopted by most continental European exchangcs.
Each of the two systems has fervent supporters. London dealers say that quote-driven trading, in which they risk their own capital, offers investors more liquidity. Paris brokers counter that order-driven trading is cheaper since they commit less capital to the market--and so demand smaller margins. There is argument about ""transparency"". In an order-driven market, trade details are published immediately. But market-makers in quote-driven markets often demand a delay in publication so that they can unwind big deals. There is also argument about which is more volatile: quote-driven markets react more quickly to news, order-driven markets miss the smoothing effect of market-makers.
Two academics attached to the Financial-Markets Group at the London School of Economics, Marcel Pagano and Ailsa Roell, have spent the past few years testing such claims.* They have drawn on the competition for trading in the same securities between order-driven continental markets and London's quote-driven SEAQ International. This offers something close to a controlled experiment.
The Pagano/Roell analysis concentrates on dealing costs, omitting differences in transfer taxes and brokers' commissions. Instead it compares, for the same shares traded at the same time, the spreads between the best buy and sell quotes on SEAQ and the nearest equivalent in Paris--the fourchette between the best buy and sell limit orders. The most detailed study they have done, of trading in July 1989, shows that spreads on SEAQ were often up to one percentage point higher than spreads in Paris.
That suggests that Paris is a cheaper market in which to deal. But it overlooks three points. Spreads apply to each market's normal bargain size, which is much smaller for Paris than for London. Later work by Ms Roell has compared the spreads for one equity, BSN, at different bargain sizes in June 1991. This found that for deals of up to about 5,000 shares Paris offered a narrower spread; thereafter London did--and above about 25,000 shares the Paris market had problems executing the order at all.
The second point is that spreads do not mean the same thing in the two markets. In an order-driven system, they measure the difference between the best buy and sell limit orders outstanding at a particular time. In a quote-driven system spreads are often a starting point for negotiation. On one estimate only 45% of trades on SEAQ are done at better than the best quote displayed.
The third point is that investors are more certain of being able to trade on quote-driven markets. Market-makers undertake to quote prices in all weathers--even during stockmarket crashes, though some may then prove slow to answer the telephone. By contrast, orders are fulfilled only if they attract counterparties--which is not easy when everyone is selling at once. Investors such as big institutions, which value certainty, may prefer quote-driven markets even if they look more expensive.
SEAQ International's growing market share suggests that big investors, at any rate, do prefer quote-driven trading. it claims to handle a third of all transactions in French and Italian blue-chip shares. But the markets are not as distinct as this implies. London market-makers use Paris prices as a basis for their quotes. Participants in both markets may report trades to both market authorities, so where has a trade actually taken place?
All this points to the unsurprising conclusion that quote-driven trading is better for big investors; and order-driven is better for small ones. That explains why several markets are moving towards a hybrid system combining elements of both. In Paris, for instance, block trades may be agreed through market-makers who are, however, required to give bidders in the market a chance to improve the quote. New York, too, operates a hybrid system: floor specialists respond to the flow of orders, but big trades are agreed upstairs.
Now London plans a hybrid system, with a wholesale market for European shares in which market-makers reign supreme alongside a domestic market that is partly order-driven. The quote-driven market has had troubles with little-traded shares, for which spreads have widened dramatically since Big Bang in 1986. An order-driven system based on specialist traders like New York's may offer investors in such stocks a better deal, by concentrating scarce trading.
The difficulty lies in marrying two trading systems at the margin. Paris has had problems fitting off-market block trades into its order-driven system: the Bourse is sitting on a brokers' report into the matter. London is delaying its new trading strategy while consultants study links between a domestic and an international SEAQ that may use different trading systems. However hard it is to do, a hybrid system is the best way to keep both large and small investors happy.

On March 9th the House of Commons social-security committee, chaired by Frank Field, a Labour member of parliament, lambasted everybody it could think of for failing to stop Robert Maxwell looting his companies' pension funds. The committee went on to recommend sweeping changes in pension-fund law. Two days later the Bank of England was accused by the House of Commons Treasury committee of not acting quickly enough to close the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).
It was an inauspicious background against which to launch the Securities and Investments Board's new plans for regulating the sale of retail financial products, published on March 11th. Yet the SIB, under its outgoing chairman, Sir David Walker, has come up with some refreshingly tough proposals. They should mean that consumers get more and clearer information about what they are being sold than they did. The thought of such clarity is sending shudders through the industry, especially among life-insurance salesmen. They could soon be treading the path beaten by double-glazing salesmen: ridicule followed by near-extinction.
The SIB does not confess to that aim. But it has accepted that full disclosure should be at the heart of its rules. In future, life insurers will have to give consumers a simple table that shows how much a consumer loses by cashing in a policy early. That such a disclosure is needed was shown by a recent SIB survey that found that one in four life insurance policies was lapsing in its first two years. The new rules will also make insurers explain how much money is diverted to pay commission and expenses, using the formula that expenses ""will reduce what we pay you by Xp in every L1."" Salesmen will have to explain in writing why they have recommended a particular product.
On intermediaries' status, the SIB had been wavering on polarisation, the rule that requires agents to be either genuinely independent or tied to a single product-supplier. Some had suggested that this was unnecessary for unit trusts; others had argued for multi-tying, noting that under the strict polarisation that has prevailed until now only one of the top banks and building societies has stayed independent. The SIB's solution is not to dilute the principle of polarisation, but to make clearer to consumers what it means. In future tied agents will have to replace confusing terms such as ""appointed representative"" with a clear statement that they are tied agents who can advise on only one brand of product. That may make consumers more alive to the merits of independents.
Consumer groups have welcomed these changes, though they observe that enforcing compliance could be tricky. They have another big quibble. The SIB is not insisting that independent advisers disclose their commissions, on the grounds that it could put them at a disadvantage to tied agents who are paid in other ways. The Consumers' Association reckons that the clearer disclosure of tied agents' status would offset such a disadvantage; and it thinks consumers have a right to know how much an agent purporting to advise them is getting for his services. It hopes the Office of Fair Trading will support this view.
One remaining issue for the regulators is whether the system would function better with fewer regulatory bodies. Overlap between watchdogs creates confusion over who is responsible for what; it also increases the risk of a small, weak regulatory body becoming too chummy with those it is supposedly policing. The social-security committee of the House of Commons concluded that supervision of pension funds by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation and the Occupational Pensions Board was feeble: it wants a reconstituted OPB to take the job.
Next week a report by Sir Kenneth Clucas is expected to recommend some mergers among the five self-regulatory bodies under the SIB. It may go as far as to suggest a single body to oversee retail financial services and another to regulate wholesale business, a solution long touted by the Labour Party. Such mergers would also help with another concern: the future of compensation funds for investors. Fimbra, the independent advisers' regulator, has exhausted its compensation fund and is being bailed out by Lautro, the life insurers' regulator; a merger between the two would formalise this arrangement.
Yet quarrels over compensation will rumble on, not least because of demands for help from taxpayers for the robbed Maxwell pensioners. Consumer groups are pressing for an increase in the SIBS L48,000 ($82,500) limit for compensation to investors in the event of wrongdoing, even though it looks generous compared with the L15,000 guarantee for bank deposits. The demand for ever-greater compensation whenever anything goes wrong will grow louder each time the government, the banks or the SIB give into it. The regulators have plenty of tough weeks ahead."

Since 1982 the excess has been no less than 5% of GDP; in 1986 it reached 20%. Like other countries in this position (Japan for instance), Taiwan has inevitably run current-account surpluses. Unlike Japan, Taiwan has also usually seen net inflows of capital. The result has been one of the world's biggest accumulations of financial assets.
At the end of January, deposits in Taiwan's legal banking system were NT$7.5 trillion ($300 billion)--roughly $15,000 for each person on the island. Deposits outside the legal system, together with private hoards of gold, might add nearly as much again to liquid savings. Japan has around three times Taiwan's GDP per person, but its deposits per head are little more than twice the figure for Taiwan, even when only legal Taiwanese deposits are counted.
Taiwan's foreign-exchange reserves are over $82 billion, the biggest in the world. They rose by $10 billion last year. Earnings on existing reserves (deposited almost entirely in commercial banks overseas) accounted for half the increase; the other half was due to short-term capital inflows from punters betting that the New Taiwan dollar would appreciate. Reserves are expected to rise by another $10 billion this year, and could reach $100 billion in 1993.
These may sound like enviable problems--and they are no problem at all for the western private bankers who are discreetly flocking to the island to pick over the world's biggest idle concentration of personal wealth. But they point to a serious flaw in Taiwan's economic management. The Taiwanese economy grew during the four decades to l990 at an annual real rate of 9% and is still expected to grow by 7% a year as far as the eye can see. It can lay claim to being one of the world's most successful economies. Yet hyperconservative financial policies are squandering its potential.
Taiwan's financial regulators have been implacably anti-debt at home and mercantilist abroad. Until the 1980s it was a criminal offence in Taiwan to bounce a cheque. The banks that the state owns or controls, which still hold more than half of all banking assets, were imbued with the civil-service spirit of caution. In some cases loan officers could be held personally liable if credits they granted went bad. Even today, says Liang Kuo-shu, chairman of the Bank of Communications (of which the state owns 97%), a government bank is answerable to the legislature for writing off any loan, no matter how small.
Lending policies are understandably cautious. Medium-and long-term loans are rarely granted against cash-flow; lenders almost always demand security worth at least twice the face value of the loan. Commercial paper is widely used for short-term borrowing, but long-term corporate bonds are practically non-existent.
Nor does the government itself borrow much. Until recently, the total outstanding stock of long-term government bonds could not legally exceed 25% of the government budget in any given year (now it is 60%). Last year the government spent a negligible 1% of GNP servicing its domestic debt; the foreign debt-service ratio is 0.5% of GNP. No secondary market for government paper exists; banks snap up the issues, which go straight into their vaults.
A large chunk of savings is not recycled into productive investment. At the end of 1991 the postal savings system--whose assets are second only to those of the government-run banks--had loans equal to a little more than 0.1% of its assets; 83% of postal savings were idly on deposit with the central bank. Credit and farmers' co-operatives did better than that, with 50-60% of their assets out in loans. But overall some 30-40% of the money legally deposited in Taiwan is immobilised in the central bank, or in institutions under its control. It is no wonder that surveys in the mid-1980s found that 45% of all lending was done through private ""credit clubs"", with 20 or so mainly middle-class members, or on the black market.
The equity market offers little alternative. New issues are designed to raise cash for the owners of a company, rather than for the company itself. The secondary market is closer to a casino than to an organised first-world stock exchange. Nor is foreign competition likely to change things much.
Foreign banks operate in Taiwan, lending a higher proportion of their assets and offering fresher products than their domestic rivals. But the foreigners are limited to three branches each, and the government restrains them by regulating their lending, deposit-taking and reserves not on the basis of their parents' worldwide capital, but on that of the Taiwan operation alone. At the beginning of 1991 foreign institutions were allowed to make direct investments in the stockmarket. But there are limits on the repatriation of gains and last month the central bank, worried about currency speculation, stopped three foreign institutions from bringing money into the country.
The central bank, which recalls perhaps too vividly the inflation and capital flight of the 1940s that preceded the communist takeover of China, is suspicious of capital flows that it does not itself control. For individuals, the yoke is light. Up to $3m a year can be moved in or out. Besides, many transfers take place under borrowed names or through the many jewellery shops which still act (illegally) as foreign-exchange dealers. But applications for approval of direct overseas investment face burdensome bureaucratic controls, as do operations by Taiwanese banks overseas (which is one reason the capital account remains in surplus).
Incredibly, the central bank said last year that, because of heavy financing demands arising in the next few years, it was important to keep money inside the country. Such mercantilism is costly. The government is paying 8-9% to borrow at home when it could be tapping world markets at several percentage points less.
Spasmodic liberalisation has brought some changes. The number of stockbrokers has risen from a handful to more than 300. A clutch of new insurers is waiting to be licensed. But the system is essentially closed.
A bigger transformation now under way might help change that. Last year 15 new commercial banks were authorised. Now they are opening their doors at a rate of one a week. And the new banks are big. Each has paid-in capital of at least NT$10 billion--a threshold so high that the government expected only four or five applications when it announced that more banks would be permitted to set up. Instead it got 19.
These new banks are already providing a welcome jolt of competition to the 20 or so staid state banks by offering innovative mortgages and cheaper loans. A messy fight is inevitable--the older banks have vast deposits and large branch networks behind them--and desirable. It is, however, undesirable that each of the new banks is backed by a big industrial group that will be tempted to use it as a captive lender. The appearance of the new banks has also put paid, for the moment, to the notion of privatising state banks, which might have been an easier way to introduce competition.
More shifts can be expected from the strain of financing the government's NT$8.2 trillion six-year public-works programme. Nobody expects the whole of this sum--equal to perhaps 150% of this year's GNP--to be spent by 1996. But planners still predict government-bond issues of NT$300 billion a year for the next few years, compared with an annual average of NT$30 billion during the 1980s. This is large enough to affect interest rates, and may force a reform of government-bond markets too.
The comprehensive overhaul that Taiwan's financial system needs is, as Mr Liang notes, hard to undertake from a starting point of serious macroeconomic imbalance. But the monetary authorities fear the rerun of a nightmare. The liquidity boom of the mid-1980s sent the Taiwan Stock Exchange index soaring from around 1,000 at the end of 1986 to over 12,000 at its peak in 1990. It quintupled property prices.
A skilfully timed monetary squeeze in 1989-90, followed by its relaxation in 1991, deflated the asset bubble while doing little damage to the real economy. With M2 now rising by 20% a year, the current-account surplus growing and strong upward pressure on the New Taiwan dollar, another big bout of asset inflation could be in store. The central bank responded last time by holding back the currency and trying to sterilise the capital inflow by selling special bonds. It would make far more sense this time to start removing the restraints that dam Taiwan's vast flow of savings away from where it can do the most good."

Many denounce effort to find where the disease came from as an invidious waste of time. But even if it is largely ignored by the experts, the question remains. People have a sneaking feeling that an origin would somehow make sense of the disease--and provide a scapegoat.
Blaming others for your misfortunes is natural, even if unjustified and unhelpful. In 1494 the French army in Italy, devastated by syphilis recently imported by Christopher Columbus, blamed the ""disease of Naples""--which the Neapolitans were calling the ""French disease"". Researchers working on AIDS are anxious to avoid this sort of name-calling, all the more so because the probable place of origin, central Africa, is itself particularly badly hit by the disease. Blaming the victim is an odious pastime.
Still, although they may bring no new insights to AIDS research and encourage pointless prejudice, questions about the origin of AIDS are not worthless. AIDS will not be the last disease to attack mankind. Knowing about the origins and evolution of disease in general is clearly worthwhile--and might conceivably help studies of the present epidemic. And there may well be lessons to be learned if, as some are suggesting, the epidemic was caused by medicine. There are two human immunodeficiency viruses known so far, HIV-1 and HIV-2. Infection with either can lead to AIDS, but they are not identical. A number of related viruses are found in various African monkeys and apes. HIV-2, which is found mainly in West Africa and seems less dangerous than HIV-1, is virtually indistinguishable from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) found in sooty mangabey monkeys. The different names reflect the difference in host, not any marked difference in the virus. The SIV closest to HIV-1, called SIV sub cpz , was found in a chimpanzee.
It is hard to imagine that HIV is not descended from an SIV that moved out of its normal host animal and into humans. That probably happened in Africa, since that is where SIV is endemic, and where HIV seems widest spread. There are many theories about how the virus jumped the species barrier, invoking a range of activities in which men and monkeys might exchange bodily fluids. Now an idea mooted for some time has entered the limelight--that polio vaccines, which are made with polio virus bred in the cells from monkeys' kidneys, could have been responsible. In the 1950s polio researchers tried various types of vaccine to protect children against the disease. Some of these early vaccines contained other viruses, as well as polio. Simian virus 40 (SV40--which comes from Asian monkeys and is not like HIV--contaminated some polio vaccine and has since infected millions of people worldwide. When it was discovered in 1961 American manufacturers started to use African monkeys instead.
This shows that, in the early days, contamination of vaccines occurred, but proves nothing about AIDS. However Blaine Elswood, an AIDS treatment activist, and Raphael Stricker, an AIDS doctor and researcher, have recently pointed out some circumstantial evidence that they find provocative--evidence reported at length in this month's Rolling Stone, and likely to be published in a scientific journal shortly (it has been rejected by at least one). A polio vaccine developed by Hilary Koprowski, until recently head of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, was in the right place at the right time. It was tried out on some 300,000 people in central Africa in the late 1950s.
The earliest AIDS case that post-mortem diagnosis has dragged to light was in 1959. According to Gerald Myers of Los Alamos National Laboratory, who studies the genes of HIV and SIV, the fate at which the virus evolves means that the six main sub-types of HIV-1 now seen could have had a common ancestor around 1960. Early cases of disease, and high levels of infection with HIV, have been recorded in the parts of central Africa where the vaccine was tried.
Dr Koprowski is unimpressed by this speculation. As a rebuttal he points out that 7m Polish children were vaccinated with the same product (though made in a different place), yet Poland did not suffer an epidemic of HIV infection. He also says ""seed stocks"" of the vaccines are available for study at the American Tissue Culture Collection in Rockville, Maryland, and can be tested for the presence of any virus. Others point out that SIV is not known to grow under the conditions used to produce vaccine and that even contaminated vaccine might not be infectious taken orally.
There is some evidence that some of the vaccine was contaminated. Albert Sabin, who developed the live polio vaccine that ended up being preferred to Dr Koprowski's, reported in 1959 that he had found an alien virus in the Koprowski vaccine. But what might it have been? Dr Koprowski thinks that the vaccine was prepared in the kidneys of Indian monkeys, although the Indian government was blocking monkey exports around that time. Asian monkeys do not carry SIV. The man responsible for production, who would know for sure, is dead.
If African monkeys were used, there is still a significant difference between the SIV found in them and HIV-1--too much for any known SIV found in monkeys to be the progenitor of HIV-1. The only SIV found so far that is really like HIV-1 is the virus found in chimps, SIV sub cpz . Chimps are not used in the production of vaccine, though they were used in vaccine tests, and thus might conceivably have brought a virus into the laboratory or passed it on to animals used in vaccine production. African monkeys have infected captive Asian monkeys in this way.
How widespread SIV sub cpz is in the wild no one can say. The only sample that has been thoroughly studied is from a chimpanzee that had been recaptured from poachers and had a lot of contact with people. It is conceivable that it was infected by humans--that its virus is in fact a form of HIV-1. A virus from another chimp is now being studied, which may shed light on the matter. If SIV sub cpz is a precursor to HIV-1, though, it is not so close to HIV-2. The two human viruses are different enough that, according to Dr Myers, their most recent common ancestor was around a century or more ago. And although the evidence suggests that HIV-1 has been changing for only a few decades it did not necessarily start diverging as soon as it crossed the species barrier. The virus could have existed in isolated villages for a long time, among a well-adapted population or one used to high mortality, evolving little. Then it might have broken bounds when people moved to the cities or, as some have suggested, when doctors and repeatedly used needles appeared.
No one is convinced by the polio-vaccine theory--reactions vary from flat rejection to an admission of a possibility. Scientists satisfied with the idea that AIDS is ""something out of Africa"" are not happy thinking it could have come out through the work of their peers. Nor does anyone want to start a panic. Vaccination experts stress that even if such infection was once possible it certainly is not now, with current test requirements. But the search for an origin will not end--because it is to the origin that people look when they ask the natural ""why?"" In this AIDS is like life, or any other great mystery. One London doctor points out that many of his AIDS patients truly believe the disease to have been created by the CIA, however much he tells them that the idea is nonsense. They need something to believe in, someone to blame."

Individual people just bump into each other. So it is with electricity. As electronic circuits shrink, so does the amount of electric current that flows through them. Eventually, it stops flowing, and starts dripping. Although electronic engineers like to think of it as a fluid, electricity is made up of individual electrons. In the tiniest currents the electrons can make their individual voices heard--if the background is quiet enough.
The simplest way to measure the effect of single electrons is to run two wires to a metal island a thousandth of a millimetre across, one as an entrance, one as an exit. Leave tiny gaps between the wires and the island to make it hard for electrons to get through, and make one gap harder for the electrons to cross than the other. That way, electrons flowing through the better junction have to queue on the island to get off through the worse one. It turns out that to increase the current--the number getting on and off every second--it is also necessary to increase the number of electrons sitting in the queue on the island. Such gregariousness comes awkwardly to electrons, which, being like charges, repel each other. To coax another electron on to the island requires a fixed increase in the voltage across the junctions to overcome this effect. So if you increase the voltage smoothly the current will increase in jumps, getting bigger every time the voltage makes it possible to increase the length of the queue on the island.
Combining two or more of these islands in a row, Michel Devoret and colleagues at the Centre for Nuclear Research at Saclay, near Paris, have managed to detect individual electrons hopping between the islands. Their technique is so good that less than one in a thousand electrons hops past undetected. If the group could improve that sensitivity, which Dr Devoret thinks will be straightforward, this device could have a practical application: it would provide a fundamental standard for measuring electric current, based on watching current ""flow"" one electron at a time. Microelectronics has already provided similar fundamental standards for voltage and resistance. A current standard would provide the electronics industry with the last of the ultra-precise measurement standards it needs.
More ambitious applications exist, including single-electron transistors, in which the presence of a single electron could turn a switch from ""off"" to ""on"". But there is a big catch. Heat makes atoms jiggle, and that tends to mess up the orderly behaviour of electrons. Until recently, the only way to measure single-electron effects was to cool the whole device to -270degC. This is not a practical option for every-day computers. To do better, it is necessary to reduce the size of the island where the electrons queue. So rather than use metal clumps, Hitoshi Nejoh of the Aono Atomcraft Project in Tsukuba, Japan, has made a single-electron device using a single liquid-crystal molecule.
One of the wires that he connected to the molecule was the needle of a scanning tunnelling microscope--a device designed to measure tiny imperfections in surfaces. The other wire was connected to the metal on which the molecule lay. This way, Dr Nejoh could observe the current going up in discrete jumps, because of the queuing effect, even when the molecule was at room temperature. Because the molecules have a tendency to wander around, this does not look like the basis for practical ""single electronics"", as the infant technology has been dubbed. But it does show that miniaturisation could eventually force circuit designers to treat electrons as individuals."

If you answered yes, the fulfilment of your technological wish is just around the corner. If you answered no, bad luck. It is still just around the corner. Researchers in many countries are experimenting with robot surgeons, which for some tasks offer significant advantages over the flesh-and-blood type.
In Britain, Brian Davies at Imperial College is working with the Institute of Urology to develop robots that can perform prostate surgery. In America, Russ Taylor, a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Laboratories in New York has, with Howard Paul of the University of California at Davis, developed robots that can assist in hip surgery. In France, Stephen Lavalle of the University of Grenoble is developing robots for brain surgery. And in Germany Ralph Mosges of the University of Aachen hopes to use robots in ear, nose and throat work.
Robots have two advantages as surgeons. They are exceedingly fast and accurate. Speed reduces trauma and hastens recovery; accuracy means that robots cutting to the quick do a minimum of damage enroute, and that they do some jobs better, as well as faster, than most humans.
To make use of these advantages, researchers must overcome a number of problems. To be safe, robots must be designed so that they cannot slip while working. They must be easily interruptible, so that if one starts messing thing up a human overseer can get it to stop, pull out and leave him free to finish the job himself. They must also be precisely positioned. Though robots have steady hands they have no way of knowing whether they are in the right place.
For prostate surgery, Dr Davies solves these problems by having robot and human work hand in hand. The cuts that will be needed to remove a diseased prostate are planned before the surgery using information from scans of the patient. The pattern of the cuts is programmed into the robot with reference to a single ""landmark"" on the land that will act as starting point--rather as the flight path of a cruise missile is worked out using reconnaissance data and then programmed into the missile's brain relative to a fixed point that it must fly over in order to begin its mission. In both cases, the idea is to limit collateral damage.
To do the cutting, the surgeon slips a thin flexible tool up the penis of an anaesthetised patient. The tip of the tool contains a lens and a light source, so the surgeon can see what he is doing, and a thermal cutting tool. Using his eyes--and other scanning equipment if he wishes--the surgeon places the cutting tool at that first landmark, and tells the robot to let it rip, as it were. So far, no robot has been made to perform surgery completely on its own. But the robot mechanism has been used to guide human hands in 40 or so operations. And in four or so more, the robot has made the first few cuts--leaving the surgeon to finish the job.
Meanwhile robots developed by Dr Taylor and Dr Paul have been training on family pets. In America (and perhaps only in America) veterinarians perform on Fido and Fifi the same sort of hip replacement surgery that is performed on humans. The key step is fitting the prosthetic hip joint into the bone. After the diseased hip joint is cut off, surgeons use a rasp to clear a hole in the bone for the prosthesis to be fitted into. The better the fit, the longer the replacement lasts. Experience with dog surgery suggests that holes cleared by robots fit the prosthesis ten times more precisely than holes made by most human doctors.
To orient the robot, the doctors borrow a trick developed by Dr Taylor to help automate welding for fighter aircraft wings. Before x-rays are taken, three pins are placed in the patient's leg. The surgery is planned using computer-aided-design equipment that describes every cut in terms of coordinates fixed relative to the pins. On the operating table, the robot is taken by the hand and guided to touch each of the pins in turn--then let loose.
Dr Paul has started a company, Integrated Surgical Systems, based in Sacramento, California. It will ready the robots for human trials--which he hopes will begin soon--and eventually the commercial market (IBM having decided not to go into the medical business). Meanwhile, back at IBM, Dr Taylor is working on ways to use computers to provide human surgeons with better tools for visualising the insides of patients--and so improve their own performance, to keep in step with their robot helpers."

The Chinese wanted to register a tiger farm in Heilongjiang, in north-eastern China. Official registration of this farm would enable it to export legally bits and pieces of the tigers it breeds. At present CITES bans international trade in tigers live, dead or dismembered. Conservationists howled and the Chinese agreed not to push it. But they will be back.
On the surface, China's request was reasonable. Tigers in captivity breed with no more fuss than domestic tabbies. The Chinese are partial to wine made from tiger bones as a pick-me-up; they value dried tiger penises as aphrodisiacs. As people in the Chinese-speaking world get richer, they can afford these expensive tastes. Better to pander to them with farm-bred tigers than poached ones.
Peter Jackson, a cat specialist with the World Conservation Union, disagrees. He says the farm could never satisfy the growing demand, but legalising exports from it would still provide cover for poaching--the rapid increase in which over the past few years is one of the biggest threats to the species's survival in the wild.
TRAFFIC, an organisation that monitors the trade in endangered species, estimates that South Korea imported 1,700kg (3,700lbs) of tiger bones between 1985 and 1990. The skeleton of an average Bengal tiger weighs 12kg. At the beginning of March, French police arrested two ethnic Chinese near Metz with a stash of 24 tiger penises.
Before the second world war, there were eight known tiger subspecies. The Bali tiger disappeared first, followed by the Caspian tiger in the 1970s. The tracks of the Javan tiger have not been seen since 1980, and nor has the tiger. There are probably fewer than 50 Amoy tigers left in their homeland south of the Yangtse--still hunted and all but doomed. There are also believed to be fewer than 50 Siberian tigers in northeast China; but there are 400 of them well protected across the border in Russia. According to government figures there are around 2,000 Indochinese tigers left in Indochina, Thailand, Burma and Malaysia, but experts believe this a wild over-estimate. Poaching is rife in all these countries except Malaysia. The Sumatran tiger, though, seems reasonably safe in Indonesian nature reserves.
The eighth type is the Bengal tiger, which has also done quite well. In the Indian subcontinent, where tiger hunting was traditionally the preserve of princes, poachers get short shrift. Over the past 20 years, India's programme to preserve the tiger has brought the number of Bengal tigers in its forests up from 1,800 to an estimated 4,000. There are another 1,000 in Nepal and Bangladesh.
This growth cannot continue forever. The number of tigers a given bit of forest can support is strictly limited. For example, Bardia wildlife reserve, in the remote west of Nepal, supports 50 adult tigers in 965 square kilometres of dense jungle, and cannot take many more. Male tigers tend to kill the male cubs in their litters to prevent future competition for territory. Young males drive older males out of their territories to areas where there is not enough game, leaving them to eat livestock or its owners. They are poisoned, shot or captured for zoos.
This would not be so bad were it not for the inexorable pressure on the forest. Over the past two decades, the subcontinent's burden of people has doubled, just as its burden of tigers has. India, Nepal and Bangladesh are democracies, and voters do not like good land being set aside for potential man-eaters. And the isolation that protects the reserves is fast diminishing. By next year an all-weather road to Bardia will be completed. It will be hard to keep hungry farmers out, let alone Chinese traders."

During the past ten years a great change has swept through the developing world: governments everywhere are turning against economic interventionism and putting their trust in market forces. In many countries, traditional thinking on development had led governments to involve themselves so deeply in economic management that years of reform will be needed to roll back the state. But there can be no doubt that the effort to do this is under way. In Latin America, Africa, South Asia and Eastern Europe--regions where interventionist methods were taken to their most ambitious extreme--it is governments themselves, not outside observers or advisers, that are most outspoken in their denunciations of the old ways, and most enraptured by market economics.
This bloodless revolution is a triumph for the relatively small group of economic thinkers who, for years, withstood the contempt of the development-economics establishment. In the 1960s and 1970s ""neo-liberal"" economists such as Peter (now Lord) Bauer were widely held to be not merely wrong, but crazy; their work was not criticised so much as laughed at. In the 1990s Lord Bauer and economists such as Anne Krueger, Bela Balassa, Deepak Lal and Ian Little are regarded--above all, in the third world itself--as largely vindicated. The costs of unchecked intervention are plain to see. From Argentina to Vietnam the old orthodoxy is smashed. Its once-influential defenders have only each other for an audience. This may not be the end of history, but to a triumphant neo-liberal it does look like the end of ""development economics"".
The contributors to ""States and Markets"", a collection of essays by economists loyal to the traditional approach, beg to differ. Undaunted by the global flight from their ideas, they insist that neo-liberalism is mostly wrong and traditional development economics is mostly right. If they are correct, the conversion of the developing world to market economics will prove a disaster.
The general message is unconvincing--but, along the way, the authors score some hits on the new orthodoxy. A smaller claim may well be defensible: even if, as many third-world governments now believe, neo-liberalism is mostly right, certain ideas from the old approach are well worth retaining.
Christopher Colclough, in a lucid essay, rightly says that a central tenet of neo-liberalism is the view that imperfect markets work better than imperfect governments. Also rightly, he argues that this claim cannot be deduced from any theory: it is an empirical proposition. His essay and much of the rest of the book then proceed as though neo-liberals believed that the claim were indeed deducible from theory. That is convenient for Mr Colclough, because it means that neo-liberalism can be refuted by one persuasive counterexample--here is a case where import quotas fostered an infant industry, here is another where a shift to market prices hindered growth. He and his colleagues offer many such examples.
But these are unpersuasive because, of course, neo-liberals agree with Mr Colclough: the view that imperfect markets work better than imperfect governments is indeed an empirical claim. As such, it cannot be refuted by ad hoc counterexamples, any more than the idea that imperfect governments work better than imperfect markets could be refuted by a few examples of government failure (of which there are many). To settle the matter, one requires well-founded statistical evidence on which of the two--imperfect markets or imperfect governments--works better as a rule.
Evidence of that sort does exist. Many studies have shown, for instance, that trade liberalisation promotes growth. However, all such results are open to challenge; one of the chapters in the book criticises the trade-reform studies on several grounds. In general, as so often in economics, the evidence is too weak to convince those, on either side, who would prefer not to be convinced.
Where does that leave the debate? The neo-liberals have on their side several large facts and some plausible ideas. The facts include the comprehensive failure of massive intervention to spur growth in the 1960s and 1970s (witness much of Latin America, most of Africa, India) and the comparative success of liberal, or liberalising, regimes (the East Asian dragons, Chile, China, Turkey). The ideas include the assertion, long denied by traditional development economics, that governments in the real world are usually incompetent or dishonest, and frequently both. Against this the authors of ""States and Markets"" offer, on the whole, the insight that the world is complicated. What works in development depends on circumstances. It is reckless to generalise--but, in many areas, the right sort of government intervention is essential.
Would that development economics had been so unassuming in the 1960s and 1970s, when comprehensive planning was proposed as the answer to pervasive market failure--a bold (and wrong) generalisation, if you please. However, the old thinking no longer cares to defend that programme; and, now that it has been watered down to a grumpy distrust of neo-liberalism, it may have a useful role to play. For there is a danger, as the authors of ""States and Markets"" argue, that the rejection of government in the third world will go too far.
Perhaps the best essay in the book, by Robert Chambers, quotes aptly from the Book of Common Prayer: ""We have left undone those things which we ought to have done, And we have done those things which we ought not to have done, And there is no health in us."" The tragedy of energetic intervention in the third world was that it was so misdirected. Governments ran industries, monopolised trade in farm produce, and turned away imports. In these and other ways they supplanted functioning markets. Where markets were certain to fail, and where intervention was therefore necessary (in providing law and order, infrastructure, primary health care and education), governments did far too little. The neo-liberal victory may well turn sour if these tasks continue to be neglected or if, as a result of the new mistrust of the state, even less is done than before.
Mr Chambers is especially keen that interventions should be designed with the true wants and needs of the poor in mind--something which, as he demonstrates, is all too rare. The chapter by Mick Moore drives this home: it shows how a weak understanding of rural irrigation led policy-makers to design infrastructure that was of little or no use to the rural poor, the people it was intended to help. At this micro-level, detailed knowledge and an unwillingness to make generalisations about what works and what does not in the third world are entirely right.
On that view, as some of the authors in this volume are even willing to admit, neo-liberalism is not wrong; it is merely incomplete. But how could it be otherwise? The world, as this book tirelessly points out, is a complicated place."

The directors of Time and Warner, gathered in secret in 1989 to make the merger that would form the biggest media company in the world, wanted a memento of the historic event. A young photographer was summoned. Looking at the array of suits in front of her, she said: ""I don't know what to do to make you guys smile. How about the word money?"" ""Can't I say stock?"", asked Steve Ross, Warner's chairman, who got nearly $200m from the deal.
Nowadays such jokes jar. The Wall Street culture of the late 1980s, which led to Time's $14-billion merger with Warner, is out of fashion. Indeed, 29 days after the deal closed, legislation was passed that in effect banned transactions built on so huge a debt. Mr Ross, a dealmaker down to his dressing-gown, is now as much a symbol of the wrong approach to business as RJR Nabisco's Ross Johnson, whom Time magazine once castigated on its cover. But, whereas Nabisco's buy-out eventually proved a success for Wall Street, Time Warner's stock has sagged ever since the merger.
Mr Clurman, who once worked for Time, has written a book that stands comparison with ""Barbarians at the Gate"", the epic tale of the Nabisco takeover by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. Mr Clurman's subtitle makes it clear that he believes Mr Ross stole the publishing from under its directors' noses. Yet the author bends over backwards to be fair to the principals.
His one fault may be his reverence for Time magazine's culture. Its founder, Henry Luce, left instructions in his will that ""Time Incorporated is now and is expected to be principally a journalistic enterprise operated in the public interest."" Yet by 1989 the company was already heavily involved in cable television and pap like People magazine. Its managers had bungled their way through a decade of failed magazine launches, aborted merger discussions and ""strategic"" recalculations.
By the time the supposedly caddish Mr Ross enters the picture, the reader almost yearns for him to have his wicked way with the prissy old journalistic dowager. Even then, it comes as a surprise to discover how easily the establishment-minded east-coast Time folk succumbed to Warner, a freewheeling entertainment company where having fun and making money often seemed equally important.
None of Time's directors asked Warner for a copy of a damaging report on Mr Ross's links with a bribery scandal at a New York theatre. Although no criminal case could be made against Mr Ross, one of his closest associates went to jail, and some details in the report might have scared Time's board. For example, Mr Ross said that the $60,000-90,000 in cash he kept hidden in his office was gambling winnings, a claim even his own lawyer found ""ridiculous"".
Not only were Time's directors negligent; they were also comprehensively out-negotiated. Because their company technically took over Warner, Warner's shareholders received cash. In the new company Mr Ross became chairman and co-chief executive with Time's Nick Nicholas. About the only victory for Time's managers was a ""blood oath"" from Mr Ross that he would give up his post as co-chief executive in 1994. Last month Time Warner's board ousted Mr Nicholas.
So far Time Warner's publishing division has borne the brunt of the company's cutbacks. Mr Clurman worries greatly about the supposedly sacred division between the magazine's ""church"", the writers, and its ""state"", the managers. So far, the merger has produced no blatant examples of Time hyping Warner movies or records; instead, it has made some of the group's journalism look more than a little awkward.
The most engaging character in the book is Mr Ross, who comes across as a mogulish mixture of Ronald Reagan and Robert Maxwell. Like the latter, Mr Ross, who began his business career managing funeral parlours and car parks, seems to live for deals. Even his opponents credit him with an amazing capacity to bounce back from adversity. And he has an almost Maxwellian zeal for protecting his reputation.
But, unlike Maxwell, Mr Ross also has a remarkable ability to inspire loyalty. He shares Mr Reagan's knack for being likeable. And his casual work-habits make him an easy man to underestimate. At one of Warner's corporate low points in 1983, Rupert Murdoch visited Mr Ross at his holiday home on Long Island and was staggered that he spent half an hour ""teaching me how to play video games"". Yet, when the Australian tried to move in on Warner, it was the amiably relaxed Mr Ross who won."

""The adventure which I am about to unfold to you is of so strange and dreadful a kind that I must implore you never to disclose it.
""I had been travelling all evening through desolate and uncharted country when a fitful ray of light fell on a castle wall above me. A night-jar shrieked. I realised I had reached the home of the infamous Count M. Entering the gloomy hall, where a smouldering fire threw shadows on the ancient, bloodstained walls, I saw a book laid open on the table, as if in readiness. With trembling hand, I turned the pages. It was all I had feared. Here, gathered in a single volume, were tales to harrow the mind, to make the eyes start and the brain run madly upon foolish terrors. It was, in brief, a collection of Gothic Tales.""
That is a parody of Horace Walpole's fantasy, ""The Castle of Otranto"", which began a brand of fiction peopled with mad abbesses, bloodthirsty monks and exquisite young ladies with a fine line in fainting fits. Half a century later Mrs Radcliffle's three-volume tales of suspense were all the rage and Jane Austen was having fun at the expense of credulous female readers who had only to see an old linen-chest to start imagining the hideous secrets it might conceal.
By the 1840s a more sophisticated form of Gothicism had been inaugurated by Edgar Allen Poe, the genius of the category; his ""Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque"" opened the way for the American school of Southern Gothic. In more recent years Joyce Carol Oates and the late Angela Carter have helped to inject the Gothic tale with a new vitality and richness of language. The latter's magnificent ""The Bloody Countess"" is the only piece in this collection that can survive comparison with the ultimate Gothic piece, Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher"". The success of the Gothic tale depends largely on the language in which it is presented, the ability to conjure poetic beauty out of sensational subject-matter.
To be picky, the anthology's introduction begs more questions than it answers. It is inexcusable to exclude Baudelaire's translations of Poe's tales into French. References to Gothic architecture do more to confuse than to clarify. It is a pity, too, that room could not have been found for an excerpt from Jane Austen's ""Northanger Abbey"", one of the best spoofs on the genre.
Niggling aside, this* is the perfect book to put beside the bed of a timorous guest you wish would go home. A casual reference to a nearby churchyard, even a discreet shake of a bunch of heavy keys, should then do the trick. Mr Baldick has lightened the gloom of 18th-century Gothic with some deeply enjoyable specimens from Sheridan le Fanu, Stevenson, Hawthorne and Faulkner. Among the less well-known, ""Selina Sedilia"" is Bret Harte's splendid send-up of Mrs Henry Wood's portentous works.
Why did it take so long to think of this anthology? A second volume, please."

Many readers will be drawn to this book by the first author's name: Richard Rogers, architect of the Lloyd's building in London and co-designer of the intestinal Pompidou Centre in Paris. They will be disappointed. Mr. Rogers contributes a few dozen pages of introduction. The rest is the work of Mark Fisher, the Labour Party's spokesman on arts and the media.
The two of them toured Europe's newly self-confident cities--Berlin, Barcelona, Paris, where bold architecture is the handmaiden of renaissance--and came home to find London, by comparison, heavy, grey and grubby. There is nothing particularly novel about this. And from Mr Rogers, who has courted controversy throughout his career, it comes as little surprise.
But it leads Mr Fisher to a dilemma. He marvels at the grands projets by which Francois Mitterrand hopes to leave his presidential mark on the French capital. ""To see the Pyramide at night, its reflection dancing in the water around it, to walk down its stairway, suspended free and moving with your step"", gushes Mr Fisher, ""...these are moments that catch your breath and put you in awe of man's ability to turn steel and stone and space into wonder.""
London, by contrast, has little more to mark the past decade than the heavy redbrick, bunker-like structure that is to be the new British Library and the jumble of styles in London's Docklands, only belatedly remedied by the splendid Canary Wharf.
Mr Fisher's problem, though, as a Labour politician with an aesthete's eye, is that majestic architectural statements come at a price. Literally: by 1989 Mr Mitterrand had spent an estimated FFr157 billion ($25 billion) on a succession of buildings--the Grande Arche de la Defense, the Pyramide outside the Louvre, the new finance ministry at Bercy. And politically: Mr Mitterrand has come in for a lot of flak over the building of the Opera House at the Bastille, which was seen as a bizarre way for a Socialist president to mark the 200th anniversary of the French revolution.
Mr Fisher sees the problem, but stumbles around it. He laments that developing a new-look London would be a lot easier ""if there were the same general presumption in favour of the future, in favour of change, as exists in Barcelona, where people are enduring great physical disruption and, in some cases, the destruction of neighbourhoods...because they have become convinced that they, and their city, will in the end be enhanced."" Although he devotes a chapter to ways of encouraging public interest in design, he fails to resolve the tension between architectural vision and social democracy.
He is at his best when describing how London might be turned to face the Thames, or be properly lit at night, and in suggesting ways to improve London's offices--the bland sandy-brick blocks surrounded by navy-blue lamp-posts with window frames painted to match that have sprouted across the city. He blames this banality on a ""design and build"" mentality in the planning departments of local authorities: when commissioning public buildings they usually plump for the cheapest option, which often means choosing a contractor who includes design in the building package. Architecture, here, becomes an afterthought.
The government's budget for public building is L3 billion ($5.3 billion) a year. Mr Fisher argues that this should be spent on fostering young architects. He would open up any public building costing over L3m to competition, draw up a year-book of budding young architects, and circulate it to all local authorities. Much of his vision for London is familiar. But in today's Britain, where visionaries are becoming a scarce breed, at least he has one to offer."

Vincent van Gogh was not a Dutch painter at all; he was an English one. That is the claim of ""Van Gogh: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"", an exhibition at London's Barbican Centre, which goes on until May 4th. It is less unlikely than it sounds.
Before irate Dutchmen don their clogs to march on the Barbican, let it be said that the exhibition's curator, Mr Martin Bailey, does not think Van Gogh was English, merely that he painted Englishly. The story goes as follows. In May 1873 the 20-year-old Vincent, not yet a practising artist, came to London to work for Goupil's, an art dealer in Covent Garden. It was in London, while lodging with the Loyer family at 87 Hackford Road, Brixton, that he produced some of his earliest surviving sketches. Not, admittedly, very good sketches--his drawing of Austin Friars' church is definitely Mid-Schoolboy Period, and there is not much to link ""Houses at Isleworth"" with cornfields at Arles--but, still, Van Goghs.
More to the point, argues Mr Bailey, it was in London that Van Gogh first became aware of the social issues that would later shape some of his gloomier pictures of working life. His experience of urban poverty may have been culled from the pages of his favourite authors, George Eliot and Charles Dickens, but it was potent. In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent dedicated himself to doing ""the things of everyday life that Dickens describes"". Given that his L90-a-year Goupil's salary put him comfortably in the Victorian nice-income bracket, Van Gogh's choice of literary inspiration seems a touch perverse; but then artists (even English ones) were always odd.
The Barbican show suggests that Van Gogh's early stay in England shaped not only the content of his later painting but their style as well. The young Dutchman was much struck by the work of the so-called Black-and-White illustrators, such as Luke Fildes, whose lithographs of scenes of poverty appeared every week in the Graphic and the Illustrated London News.
Being engravings, these works were hard-contoured and tended to deep chiaroscuro, both traits of Van Gogh's later canvases. Most artists move from painting to engraving. Van Gogh went the other way. And the engravings that inspired him were undeniably English. A comparison of Fildes's cane-bottomed chair in an illustration from ""Edwin Drood"" with Van Gogh's famous painting of the same subject--both in the Barbican--should satisfy even the most Netherlandophile critic on this point.
To say that Van Gogh's chief legacy of his three years in London should have been a taste for painting unhappiness seems a backhanded compliment; but there is worse. In the house of Mr and Mrs Loyer lived their young daughter, Eugenie. The catalogue's chronology tells the story: ""August 1873: Van Gogh becomes infatuated with Eugenie""; ""February 1874: Eugenie is engaged to Samuel Plowman""; ""Early August: Van Gogh declares love for Eugenie""; ""Mid-August: moves to new lodgings"". Barely a decade later, Van Gogh would be cutting off his ear for unrequited love. The tendency seems to have had its beginnings in England. Mr Bailey may be correct in pointing all this out. Whether one should thank him for doing so is another matter."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224153739/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/62?accountid=14657,"If the Royal Academy had been in doubt about the success of its Mantegna exhibition, it can give a sigh of relief. Andrea Mantegna is not exactly a household name, even in London. In the late 20th century the bankable old masters are the Impressionists and post-Impressionists, not awkward stars of the Renaissance. The show was further hampered, the Academy may have feared, by the unavailability of a number of Mantegna's masterpieces: frescoes and altarpieces cannot travel, and several other works were withheld because they were said to be ""too fragile"". And yet, since its opening on January 17th, the exhibition has won not only the critics' applause but a remarkably good attendance, with an average of close to 2,500 visitors a day.
This is partly because the Academy presents Mantegna's works so well. The exhibition strikes a happy balance between the needs of scholarship and the pleasure of the general viewer, a combination that is carried into the magnificent catalogue. But its main appeal lies in the strange, imposing figure of Mantegna himself, and in a style of painting that runs counter to what most people expect from art today.
In the early Renaissance, the invention of perspective gave artists the power to put on to a flat surface the world as it is seen by the eye. Painting suddenly took on the excitement of a new science. In the second half of the 15th century Mantegna was renowned for his ingegno, the ingenuity with which he could transform a two-dimensional surface into a three-dimensional picture. Some of the paintings at the Royal Academy therefore have an odd, almost experimental look. Although their nominal subjects are almost always religious or classical, they are really about presenting objects in space.
Among his contemporaries, Mantegna's hero was the sculptor Donatello, and his own works often seem to be a sort of sculpture. The historian Vasari records that it was complained that ""his pictures resembled ancient statues and such-like thin rather than living creatures"". This tendency was due both to Montegna's love of figures in the round and to his devotion to all aspects of antiquity, on which he had made himself an authority. Ever since, these influences have inspired accusations both that he was excessively theoretical and that his love of classical detail verged on the pedantic.
But Montegna is still a stunning painter; he knew the painter's essential art, which is simultaneously to deceive and enchant the eye. In some ways he is at his best in simple compositions containing only a few figures, because these reveal most clearly his skill at foreshortening and perspective. One of his favourite devices is to place a single, heroic figure within an architectural framework, as if it were a piece of sculpture in an alcove. This comes close to trompe l'oeil, art imitating art rather than nature. The same effect is taken even further in Mantegna's works in grisaille, monochrome painting designed to look like stone or bronze.
To a modern eye all this is curious, because the modern eye has been led to expect compositions in which colour is the dominant element. Although Mantegna can use colour admirably, drawing is the more fundamental part of his craft. His colour is decorative rather than basic to the design. For this reason, some of his strongest work comes in his engravings, in which he is a pioneer, ""the first genius"", says the catalogue, ""to devote himself to engraving"". It is here that his ""stern, uncompromising cast of mind"" and ""almost merciless precision"" can be felt.
This is a long way from Renoir and Monet, who charm with a lyrical mixture of colour, air and light. Yet Mantegna has his music too, from the grave rhythms of his grisaille figures to the tenderness of all his versions of the Madonna and Child. Looking at these works now, you can still feel something of the wonder the people of the early Renaissance must have felt on seeing the human likeness exactly rendered.
In his own time, Mantegna was most famous for the massive series, ""The Triumphs of Caesar"", which fills the last room of the Academy show like a frieze stretching across the facade of some enormous temple. Depicting a triumphal procession, it teems with a multitude of bodies, in every kind of posture and attitude. Mantegna's patron, Francesco Gonzaga, wrote that its ""images are almost alive and breathing, so that the subject seems not to be represented, but actually to exist"". This is painting in the grand manner, still with its full power to astonish."

Since 1792, Frenchmen have been singing as their national anthem the words Rouget de Lisle wrote that year for a revolutionary song, ""La Marseillaise"". In 1989, when the country was celebrating the 200th anniversary of the revolution, a lone voice crying to the media, a priest called Abbe Pierre, urged the changing of ""the message of hate in the Marseillaise into a message of love"". No one listened to the frail abbe at the time, and Jessye Norman in all her finery belted out the words as usual for the July 14th parade. Now, belatedly, the case for change maybe catching French ears.
Another festival, last month's Albertville winter Olympics, made the French listen to the words again. Now those who say they should be changed include Danielle Mitterrand, the wife of the French president; the head of the Paris opera, Pierre Berge; and the boss of the French national football team, Michel Platini. At the Olympics' opening all found themselves flinching when a local shoolgirl sang that gruesome bit about ""impure blood drenching our furrowed fields."" This is 1992, after all, they thought; violent sentiments really have to go.
Others feel otherwise. A recent opinion poll suggested that, although 40% of Frenchmen think their national song is too violent, only a quarter believe it should actually be changed. The reasons for staying with the status quo are as complex as the French character. Some supporters of the existing words believe that a bit of agressivity is a proper part of these things. Others argue, more mildly, that a national anthem by definition has to contain a dose of nationalism.
In England a few years back, when it was suggested that it might be tactful to omit from ""God Save the Queen"" the verse urging God, contemplating the queen's enemies, to ""confound their politics/Frustrate their knavish tricks"", there was little outcry. They order these things differently in France.
There, a new book* by a priest and journalist, Jean Toulat, has roused the media. A conservative newspaper, Figaro, headlined its story, ""Must we pacify the Marseillaise?"" A historian, Pierre Miquel, explained that, although ""God Save the Queen"" struck him as both ""medieval"" and ""grotesque"", he thought those who wished to change the French anthem ""show the same kind of sensitivity as those who wish to protect baby seals"": for him, both risible groups.
Detachment is hard on a subject that still stirs the passions. A much-decorated officer, General Maurice Schmitt, has observed: ""The entire world knows that the words are like this. So many people sang the Marseillaise with these words when they were being led off to be shot."" Such is not the view of a former minister, Francoise Giroud, who thinks the words are ""distressing"" but reckons that, fortunately, no one can remember what they are.
France still being France, Le Canard Enchaine suggests that a new version be prepared by Marguerite Duras, the author of the best-selling novel ""L'Amant"", which would begin: ""Allons, amants de la patrie..."" In war or love, familiar or not, Rouget de Lisle's version seems likely to be around, inspiring or irritating the French, for some time yet."

They are not even close to doing so. Although scientists have succeeded in giving machines all sorts of human skills, the goal of creating a machine as clever as a person seems to recede all the time. Ironically, this failure may eventually change the way in which people work and live more comprehensively than if scientists had succeeded in getting a computer to sit up and say ""Mother!""
The skills with which researchers have so far endowed their machines are both intellectually impressive and practically useful. Computers called Deep Thought and M-Chess can beat all but grandmasters at chess. In Merced, a Californian county, computers work alongside clerks to administer welfare benefits. Researchers at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh have built a lorry that can drive itself.
Often and painfully, researchers have learnt the lesson that being able to perform the same job as a person, even an intelligent one, is different from being truly intelligent. As Anatol Holt, a researcher in the field of artificial intelligence, once noted:
A brilliant chess move while the room is filling with smoke because the house is burning down does not show intelligence. If the capacity for brilliant chess moves without regard to life circumstances deserves a name, I would naturally call it ""artificial intelligence"".
The more that computers do tasks hitherto reserved for people, the more they demonstrate an ability to be brilliant in some ways while remaining moronic in others. Herbert Simon of Carnegie-Mellon University, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence (AI) research, recalls that the biggest surprise of his decades spent trying to recreate human intelligence was ""how easy the 'hard' things were to do, and how hard the 'easy' things"". His first AI program, completed in 1955, enabled a computer to work out simple logical theorems (ie, principles of valid reasoning). Since then the logical skills of computers have increased by leaps and bounds. But nobody has built a machine that can navigate across a crowded room or understand a children's story. This curious combination of brilliance and stupidity leaves their creators on the horns of a dilemma.
FRIEND OR FOOL
Computers are too clever to ignore but too stupid to be trusted entirely. ""Expert systems"", computer programs designed to capture human expertise, provide a case in point. MYCIN, one of the first expert systems, was created nearly two decades ago by Edward Shortliffe at Stanford University. Given the symptoms of a bacterial infection, MYCIN can recommend a treatment as well as most of Stanford's top specialists can. In tests MYCIN does better than many of the newly qualified doctors who are prescribing drugs for real people. Unfortunately, it cannot distinguish between a patient who needs treatment for a bacterial infection and one who needs a midwife. It tries to interpret every ache, pain and bump in terms of bacteria.
Each in its own way, all of today's intelligent computers can be just as idiotic as MYCIN. But thousands of expert systems and other artificially intelligent programs are being put to work nonetheless, because their users have found ways to overcome the machines' inadequacies. The trick typically lies in having the computer work closely with people, in order to take advantage of the strengths of each--the person's common sense and the machine's memory and logical skills.
Thus clerks at Britain's Trustee Savings Bank ask an expert system to help find which pension funds and other investments would be best for their clients, combining their own sales skills with the machine's knowledge of finance and financial products. The New York Stock Exchange uses an expert system to sort through mountains of trading statistics in search of clues to crime. Rather than replace people--as many early proponents of expert systems predicted--intelligent computers have typically been put to use making clever people cleverer.
Finding more such opportunities for teamwork between man and machine is one of the great technological challenges of the next few decades. The potential rewards are huge. More intelligent machines have already demonstrated their ability to help people work more intelligently, even if they cannot be truly intelligent themselves. They can help businesses to capture and make use of the deluge of information that computers release. And they can bring previously inaccessible knowledge and skills to people's fingertips.
MANNERS MAKETH MIND
Needless to say, harvesting these rewards will not be easy. Given the nature of the tasks at hand, the technology is still relatively primitive. And nobody knows whether or not there are fundamental limits to the ability of machines to think like people--or to people's ability to share work productively with a machine.
Yet the seeds of profound change can be seen even today. To the extent that computers can mimic human decision-making, they are gradually transforming the abilities which are valued and rewarded in people. Many of the skills that make tax accountants highly paid professionals--to pick a job more or less at random--may tomorrow be available shrink-wrapped on the shelves of the local software emporium.
The process of deciding which jobs will be reserved for people and which handed over to machines is already under way. A decade or so ago a traveller facing a stormy night's flight might console himself with the thought that his aircraft was no doubt being flown by an experienced pilot; today the same traveller might well find the idea of a sophisticated autopilot equally consoling.
The process of accommodation to cleverer machines is a fitful and uneven one. It depends on factors ranging from technology to manners. The technological challenge is to clear an intellectual common ground between man and machine: that is, enabling machines at least to act as if they understood words, reasoning and perception. More prosaic social challenges include giving the machines enough conversational savvy to make them worth talking to. To see the progress of machines into the world of thought, start by reviewing the successes and failures of the first generation of artificially intelligent machines.
IN ITS CREATORS' IMAGE
One of the hardest topics of debate in artificial intelligence is what sort of subject it is. Some researchers reckon that AI is a science, whose goal is to work alongside psychology and neurobiology to explain the workings of mind and brain. Others believe AI to be part of engineering, whose raison d'etre is to make tools. In practice most researchers proceed as if the answer lay somewhere in between: AI aims to make useful tools whose design is inspired by the mind.
Though researchers have had, at best, mixed success in getting machines to mimic human thought, they have time and again demonstrated two points about humans. First, people want to believe in thinking machines--out of fear or fascination or both. Second, they are notoriously poor at defining what it means to think. Perhaps because people have encountered thinking machines only in people-shaped packages, they tend to assume that if a machine can do one intelligent-looking thing it can--like a person--do them all.
The consequence is that even people who should know better are easily fooled by AI programs, and are deeply disappointed when they are fooled. In the late 1960s a program called ELIZA was popularly acclaimed as the world's first automated psychiatrist, even though its creator, Joseph Weizenbaum, denied that it was anything of the sort. In the mid-1970s SHAKEY, an experimental robot built at the Stanford Research Institute, was touted as the progenitor of a race of mechanical men--much to the horror of the researchers who built it. They tried to explain that SHAKEY could in fact barely navigate an empty corridor, let alone an obstacle-strewn factory floor.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS
One irony of the high expectations that AI seems irresistibly to engender is that it has made successes look like failures. As a mechanical man, SHAKEY was a flop. But techniques used by SHAKEY to plan its actions were instrumental in creating programs that help people to plan everything from factory production schedules to troop movements. One such program--originally developed by Ascent Technology, a small firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to help Delta Airlines allocate landing gates at busy airports--was used to help plan the deployment of men and materials in the Gulf war. America's Defence Department, which has supported most of that country's AI research, claimed that this one application paid back much of the investment it has so far made in AI.
Repeated cycles of enthusiasm and disappointment have also changed researchers' expectations of what an intelligent program should do. In the early days they hoped to find a general theory of intelligence; in 1956 Herbert Simon dubbed his second AI program, created with Allen Newell, also of Carnegie Mellon, the ""General Problem Solver"". Today most AI researchers have given up the dream of finding a general theory of intelligence. Instead they are filling a toolbox of problem-solving techniques, each one suited to different jobs.
This shift has highlighted differences of interest and approach within AI. Computer vision, for example, has evolved into a more or less separate discipline, which draws as much from theories of signal processing that would be familiar to a television engineer as it does from more abstract techniques for computer reasoning. And the traditional core of AI, computer reasoning, comprises three different (though not always distinct) main camps.
* One group--call them the humanists-takes its inspiration from psychology. It wants to discover how people think and then simulate those processes on a computer. So Messrs Newell and Simon based the design of the General Problem Solver on psychological experiments in which they got students to talk aloud about their efforts to solve logic problems. Although psychology and introspection have fuelled many advances in AI, it can sometimes be hard to predict when programs based on these techniques will break down and when they will work perfectly.
* Partly in order to achieve greater predictability, another group of researchers prefers to base AI programs on formal logic (a mathematical sort of science which attempts to codify the principles of valid reasoning). One achievement of the logicists has been to create new forms of ""non-monotonic"" logic. Chains of reasoning based on traditional logic fall apart if an assumption on which they depend turns out to be wrong, whereas non-monotonic systems of logic can recover and cope with the necessary readjustments.
* A third group reckons that both the logicists and the humanists are jumping the gun. This group--call them the structuralists--believes that the best way to simulate the workings of the mind is to recreate the information-processing capabilities of the brain. So the largest faction within this group, known as the connectionists, are building inter-connected networks of artificial ""neurons"" on silicon, just like those found in real brains. Such ""neural networks"" turn out to have intriguing abilities.
These tools are being used to build AI systems that are very different to those commonly envisioned even a few years ago. Instead of big systems dispensing wisdom like some sage of old, the vast majority of today's artificial intelligences are small and barely noticeable. With a few exceptions, they do modest tasks, and are so deeply embedded within computer networks that their users often do not even know that they are there, working quietly to process motor-warranty claims, approve executive expense accounts or simply to help route telephone calls.
Steve Cross of America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, one of the administrators of the $35m or so which his agency provides for AI research each year, expects AI to blossom in the role of assistant, helping people rather than replacing them. In the wake of the cold war, he argues, the armed forces will have to become more flexible and quicker to respond to the unexpected. Yet they will have to do so with fewer people, particularly in logistics and support. AI, he believes, can help.
Many computer companies share this view. Nathan Myrhvold--head of research at Microsoft, the world's biggest supplier of personal-computer software--is keen on teaching computers to cope with commands in more-or-less English. IBM is bullish about computers that can understand simple spoken commands. Aldus, which makes desktop-publishing software, is said to be trying to incorporate a small expert system into its best-selling Pagemaker software, to help advise people on how to make better-looking documents. Thus, although jaded by the over-enthusiasm of AI researchers, businessmen are giving the technology a second look.
MANAGING THE MACHINES
Businessmen have good reason to be sceptical of computers. in the 1960s computer salesmen told them that the mainframe computer would boost their productivity by helping to centralise decision-making. It didn't. In the 1970s and early 1980s computer salesmen said that mini-and micro-computers would boost productivity by helping to decentralise decision-making. They didn't. Then, by the mid-1980s, the salesmen were saying that AI would boost productivity by eliminating human decision-making altogether. And pigs will fly.
But despite--or, in some cases, because of--a healthy scepticism, AI has been making quiet progress in business. In Japan it has inspired new products. In western countries it has mostly been put to work in the office, helping people to cope with the floods of information that computers have released. In both places the stage has been set for AI to shine over the next decade or so.
One pre requisite for the increased use of AI is simply computer muscle: AI techniques require plenty of processing power and computer memory. They work far better when they can get their data over a network rather than having it laboriously typed in.
With today's power, all sorts of tricks become possible. Matsushita, for example, has made a video camera that cuts out the jitter caused by shaky hands. It uses a technique to detect motion that was developed by computer-vision researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on a multi-million-dollar supercomputer called a Connection Machine. With today's circuit-packed semiconductors, Matsushita has been able to adapt a version of this technique (albeit much simplified) on to a thumbnail-sized chip.
As processing power increases, so too will the practical uses of AI. But the driving force behind the use of more intelligent computers is not more capable technology: it is more intelligent managers and computer users.
FASTER, HARDER, SMARTER
Businessmen are discovering that information technology is frustratingly different from other forms of automation. The classic approach to automation is to break tasks down into smaller pieces. Frederick Taylor, a turn-of-the-century management theorist who created the modern production line, invented a discipline called ""scientific management"" that divided factory work, bolt by bolt, into simple, repetitive steps. Alfred Sloan, the creator of General Motors, devised a ""functional"" organisation of management which similarly separated white-collar workers into various classes of salesmen, accountants and so forth.
Such techniques made the growth of the 20th century's industrial giants possible, but they are now reaching the point of diminishing returns. Sheer economies of scale in production provide less competitive advantage than they did when Henry Ford made the Model T. Similarly, the disadvantages of classical management are becoming more burdensome now that change comes more often and more quickly. The disadvantages of dividing work to make it more manageable are bureaucracy, rigidity and inertia. Bureaucratic organisations are slow to notice the need to change, because no single person sees enough of the overall picture. And once organisations do realise the need, they are also slow to act: the division of labour means that even smallish changes to one job ripple through to a host of others, so even small changes require lots of reorganisation.
Some companies have resolved this conundrum by giving workers more and broader responsibilities. Instead of being asked, say, to ""expedite customer-complaint form 2-112/B"", workers are charged simply with ""solving the customers' technical problems"". One big (and as yet largely unresolved) difficulty is keeping these newly liberated problem-solvers working in harmony. Another related burden is making sure that they have all the information they need. On both counts, the technology of AI has already shown it can help.
POWER TO THE PEOPLE
At US West, a big American telecoms company, executives recently reorganised the customer-service department. So far, so boring. But instead of putting workers in charge of fixing a particular sort of fault, they have made them responsible for satisfying a certain number of customers--whatever the fault may be. To help these newly solicitous employees do their jobs, US West, together with consultants from the Carnegie Group, gave each worker a computer that contained a small expert system to advise him on whom he should talk to about getting various faults fixed.
Like any useful technology, AI is no panacea. Sometimes the technology just does not work. Sometimes the technology is badly managed. An American airline (which prefers to remain nameless) proved the fact that people do not like taking orders from a machine when it installed an expert system to schedule the work of maintenance engineers. The engineers simply rejected the system's plans and it had to be withdrawn. But when, after a suitable delay, the airline reintroduced more or less the same system for engineers to use when and if they wanted, it was much better received.
In all branches of industry there are experiments going on to see how fast-changing technology can improve fast-changing work practices. Amid all the chaos, finding the right match of technology and business is not easy. One sort of AI system that seems to be popping up in all sorts of places, however, is the expert system. The next article explains why.
BUREAUCRATS OF THE MIND
They are the bureaucrats Of AI: expert systems see life as a book of rules. They apply these rules rigorously, fairly and predictably. But they are utterly lost when they meet something that is not in the book. It is perhaps not surprising that mechanical bureaucrats have become the favourite creation of AI--and it is somewhat ironic that they have often been cast in the role of human-bureaucracy busters.
Rules are the very stuff of expert systems. The business of making such a system involves sitting down with an expert in the relevant field and trying to codify his knowledge. This knowledge is typically fed into the computer in the form of ""if... then..."" rules. Thus an expert system for the identification of trees might contain rules like:
If the season is winter and the tree has foliage, then the tree is evergreen. If the tree is evergreen and the foliage is needle-shaped, then the tree is a pine. If the tree is evergreen and the foliage is leaf-shaped and spiky, then the tree is a holly.
The expert system also contains a piece of software, called an inference engine, to apply these rules to whatever facts are fed in. Thus if a system with those rules were to be told that the season is winter and the tree has leaves, it would conclude that the tree is evergreen. It would then try to apply the rules about evergreen trees by finding out about the shape of the foliage. And so on, until it either reached a conclusion or ran out of rules to apply.
BY THE NUMBERS
Such simple, mechanical reasoning can go a surprisingly long way, provided there is a well-constructed collection of rules. One perennial problem, however, is the literal-mindedness of computers. Unless it is explicitly told how to do so, the machine has no way of translating the knowledge that, say, a tree is green in January into the more relevant fact that it has foliage in winter.
Given the amount of detail in which propositions have to be laid out for a computer to make use of them, another problem for expert systems is managing a profusion of rules. A typical system will have hundreds of them. Often more than one rule seems to be applicable. Finding a way to choose between them is one of the hardest challenges for expert-system designers. Because most expert systems have no way to retract a conclusion that has been drawn by applying the wrong rule, getting it right first time is crucial.
One technique for dealing with a confusion of rules, pioneered by MYCIN, the grandfather of expert systems, is to associate a number, called a certainty factor, with each assertion. This indicates how sure the system is about its truth. A certainty factor of one typically indicates that the system believes this ""fact"" absolutely; a factor of minus one indicates absolute disbelief; anything between the two indicates some measure of ignorance or doubt. As it applies rules, the system's inference engine also combines certainty factors. With this system, all applicable rules are typically applied at each opportunity. At the end the system adopts the conclusion with the highest certainty factor.
Another technique for managing the complexity of knowledge, originally proposed by Marvin Minsky Of MIT, is to link intuitively related ideas together in ""frames"". In the human mind most ideas carry with them a fairly predictable set of associations. The idea of ""car"", for example, carries with it wheels, tyres, driving, roads and so on. Through clever programming, ideas can similarly be linked within the computer.
A third approach is to remove the limitation that an expert system cannot retract any inference drawn from its rules. Some inference engines do allow the system to back up and start again if a line of reasoning runs into a dead end. In this way it tries all possible combinations of rules, so the choice of which one to apply affects only how quickly a conclusion is reached.
Each of these techniques has its drawbacks. People turn out to be remarkably bad at estimating certainty factors. Getting the right combination of ideas in a frame can be frustratingly less intuitive than it first appears. And although backtracking over inferences that had led to a dead end allows the system to consider a broader range of possibilities, the time needed to do so can make it unusably slow.
CAUTION: MACHINE AT WORK
With time and experience, computer scientists have nevertheless built these technologies into ready-to-use packages. So-called expert-system shells, which a buyer can customise in order to apply to many fields of expertise, are available from several companies--including young firms like Inference in Los Angeles, Aion and Neuron Data, both of Palo Alto, California, alongside computer giants like IBM and DEC.
Even with the benefit of all these techniques, the range of expertise that can be captured by an expert system is limited to simple, self-contained jobs which require no commonsense reasoning. But in part because the trend in management over the past century has been to break jobs into smaller, and supposedly more manageable, pieces, there turn out to be many things that expert systems can do without stretching.
Because business procedures can often be expressed more easily as expert-system rules than as programs written in conventional computer languages, companies have discovered that they can be particularly useful to meet fast-changing competition. American Airlines used an expert-system shell from inference to update the rules of its frequent-flyer benefits in order to keep up with rival airlines. California's state government uses an expert system to process employee travel claims--more reliably, it reckons, than people used to do.
Much of the innovation needed to make better use of a machine's skills is managerial rather than technical; what it takes is the creation of organisations that can use the machine's bureaucratic skills to reduce human bureaucracy. The rudiments of the task are straightforward. Get the expert systems working in close harness with people. The machine does the routine work by the rules; the person then has more scope to do the rest of the job, which is typically the parts requiring real human intelligence, commonsense and creativity.
For several years American Express has approved credit-card transactions this way. To cope with millions of transactions each day, it built an expert system, called the Authoriser's Assistant. About two-thirds of the transactions are so routine that the system can handle them itself. If it finds anything out of the ordinary, it hands the facts of the case over to a person for a final decision.
The bad news for managers trying to recreate such success stories is that changing the way people work together is one of the hardest things to do. The process is messy, and bright-sounding theories can founder on any number of apparently trivial details. The good news is that the technology itself is becoming more capable, which at least provides more room to manoeuvre in tackling the problems posed by people. To see how the machines are improving, start with the problem of knowledge.
THE BURDEN OF KNOWLEDGE
One reason why today's expert systems are so narrow-minded is that they are ignorant. Although computers can calculate pi to a thousand decimal places in the twinkling of an eye, they do not know any of the things that people learn in the playpen: such as that apples are to eat, that shoes are not, and that heads are more or less permanently attached to bodies.
In retrospect, one of the surprises of AI has been how far computers have got without such knowledge. Chess-playing programs have no more knowledge of the game than the rankest human amateur. They know the legal moves, and they have a simplistic idea of what constitutes a good position: eg, having more pieces than the opponent. But they are completely ignorant of strategy. They make up for this ignorance by their ability to search through billions of possible sequences of moves in order to find the best one.
In the 1960s and 1970s, AI researchers found a number of elegant ways of organising such exhaustive, ""brute-force"" searches for solutions. American Airlines today uses one such technique to find routes for jetliners that will put them in the same cities as the maintenance facilities they need when they need them and not before.
In practice such techniques work only for problems in which the range of possible solutions is relatively limited; otherwise they are overwhelmed. In chess, for example, there are about 35 legal moves that can follow from each board position. Today's most powerful chess-playing computers can examine all those possibilities for 10-12 moves into the future, which is more than enough to play a good game. But in the Japanese game of Go there are 100 or so possible moves at each board position, and computers are just about useless.
JUST THE FACTS, MA'AM
Having bumped up against the limits of ignorance, AI researchers have become increasingly enthusiastic about knowledge. They hope it will make their machines more efficient at reasoning, by enabling them to concentrate on relevant possibilities. They also hope it will make them less prone to moronic mistakes. More ambitiously, Mark Stefik of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre, and others, predict a new sort of publishing industry. Alongside ""do-it-yourself"" books will pop up ""do-it-itself"" software which, in addition to teaching a person, say, how to do his taxes in theory, can actually work through the forms with him.
This attractive vision raises several unanswered questions. First, how much knowledge would a ""do-it-itself book"" need? In the case of people, the magpie-like collection of facts that makes up commonsense knowledge comes as a complete package. Although it would be nice to give, say, a tax-accountancy expert system a basic idea of what money is, nobody really knows how to disentangle this idea from the mess of other facts in the human brain--or indeed if it can be disentangled at all. Must the idea of money include ""retirement"", for example? And if so, must it also include ""time""?
The most ambitious effort to answer these question is being undertaken by Doug Lenat and his colleagues at the Microelectronics and Computer Consortium, an industry-financed research group in Austin, Texas. Since 1986 Dr Lenat and his colleagues have been painstakingly typing knowledge into a computer called Cyc. By the mid-1990s they hope to equip Cyc with about 10m pieces of information. The hope is that it will then know about as much as a five-year-old--including a rough grasp of gravity, bodies, money, shopping, time, and fairy tales. With that much knowledge, Dr Lenat hopes that Cyc will be able to do a number of things that existing AI systems cannot do, including translate new ideas into concepts with which it is already familiar, and thus help to teach itself.
Meanwhile, Edward Feigenbaum and his colleagues at Stanford's Knowledge Systems Laboratory are taking a different approach to making more knowledgeable machines. Instead of typing in all the knowledge that a person might have, they want to enable a machine simply to share the knowledge that other computers already possess. Tbe knowledge in today's expert systems is so tangled up with the structure of the programs themselves that it cannot be shared with any other system. So expert systems cannot co-operate in solving problems. Nor can the knowledge of one easily serve as the building-blocks for another.
UP IN THE MORNING AN OFF TO SCHOOL
Tbe heart of the expert-system challenge is providing computers with a common core of concepts with which to describe the knowledge they would share. The more general descriptions need to be, the harder this becomes. For two computer-aided design (CAD) programs, say, to share knowledge about an engine part is relatively straightforward, because both think of parts in terms of geometry: ie, lines and dimensions. But for a CAD program to describe the same part to, say, a design expert system searching for a component, it would have to use a broader vocabulary of ideas to describe what the part might be used for. Tom Gruber at Stanford is leading a group trying to provide machines with just such concepts. Although the ability to reuse knowledge that has already been mastered by one system will provide huge practical benefits (and probably create a medium-sized industry or two of knowledge-providers) it will solve only part of the problem of creating more knowledgeable computers. For that, machines must be taught to learn.
Artificial-intelligence researchers do not, by and large, share the views of that great 17th-century philosopher, John Locke. They do not believe that the human mind begins as a blank slate, to be filled by experience. Most would argue that you need some knowledge first in order to learn. One prerequisite is a basic vocabulary of concepts, such as the one Dr Gruber is trying to create. Another, implicit, form of knowledge lies in the rules which govern the combining of these concepts to form new ideas.
Over the years the hope of letting machines learn from their own experiences has inspired the creation of a number of machine-learning techniques. One popular one, called inductive learning, picks up new ideas by sifting through a stream of concepts to find the common ground. For example, Patrick Winston of MIT wrote a program that could learn the concept of an arch by examining descriptions of simple structures made of blocks, and distilling common qualities of those which it was told were arches--thus learning that the colour of blocks was not relevant to ""archness"" but that their position was.
Another way of learning from experience is to generalise from past successes and failures. As it tries to solve problems, SOAR, a program created by Allen Newell of Carnegie-Mellon University and John Laird of the University of Michigan, keeps track of which lines of reasoning have turned out to be useful. When it comes up with a helpful line of reasoning, it stores it away, indexed by a description of the situation in which it helped.
Although several learning techniques are creeping into working systems, trying to get good results out of them can be frustrating. One problem is that the knowledge needed to learn inevitably introduces bias. And bias subtly affects what can be learnt. An inductive learner, trying to grasp the concept ""dog"", would classify the qualities of the examples it was shown into three categories: must-have (for those qualities that only dogs have); can't-have (for those that no dogs have); and don't-care (for qualities that only some dogs have). With this scheme it could learn that having a head can help distinguish a dog from a carrot, because all dogs have one head and no carrots do. But it could not learn that colour can help to distinguish a dog from a carrot, because dogs can be black, brown, white and so on, but not garish, bright orange.
A related problem is that the lessons man or machine can most profitably learn depend on what he wants to do with the knowledge--ie, what sort of reasoning he wants to use. And techniques for computer reasoning are changing fast.
AN ANSWER TO EVERYTHING
For centuries people have dreamed of a reasoning machine so powerful that it could eliminate human argument. A 17th-century mathematician and philosopher, Gottfried Leibniz, fantasised about devising logical techniques that would let any two philosophers settle any debate once and for all just by sitting down and ""calculating"". The more time people spend searching for the ultimate reasoning mechanism, the more evidence piles up that such things cannot exist.
Some things are just not decidable by logic--even if they are logical problems. Although computer reasoners can be guaranteed to answer some (but only some) sorts of questions, they cannot be guaranteed to answer all questions of that sort. And even for the sort of work that automated reasoners can do, there is no guarantee that they will grind to a halt and reach a conclusion before the universe itself does.
Such realisations are humbling for researchers looking into computer reasoning. They would love to come up with ways of improving on human reasoning; but many would be happy just to devise ways of muddling along as well as people do. Even that is proving to be quite a challenge. The research is proceeding on two levels. Theoretically, the task is to come up with better theories for understanding reasoning. Practically, the task is building these new theories into working computer programs. Muddled progress is being made on both fronts.
WRONG AGAIN
Some of the most interesting results come from trying to extend the deductive procedures of formal logic to the real world. Historically, systems of logic were designed to study problems in which all the relevant facts are known and any new information is guaranteed not to contradict the old. Such assumptions turn out to be completely unrealistic for solving practical problems.
For example, conventional theories of logic are flummoxed by the introduction of anomalous terms such as ""penguin"". A useful assumption for anyone or anything that wants to reason about the world is that birds fly. Yet penguins are defined as birds, and penguins do not fly. Faced with such a contradiction, conventional logics must either give up the convenient assumption that birds can fly, or foreswear thinking about penguins. So-called non-monotonic logics can do better.
At the theoretical level, John McCarthy of Stanford University has proposed a theory called circumscription. This shows that most of the useful deductive tools of logic still apply if generalisations such as ""birds can fly"" are qualified by a phrase like ""assuming there is nothing abnormal about them"". And there are other variants on this approach.
At a practical level, the real work of non-monotonic reasoning is done by the wonderfully named ""truth-maintenance system"" (TMS), originally developed by Jon Doyle of MIT (and since improved upon by others, notably Johan de Kleer of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre). At heart, a truth-maintenance system is a sort of book-keeping device that keeps track of which conclusions depend on which premises. When a contradiction (eg, a flightless bird) is found, the TMS can work through the chain of reasoning to see which assumptions will have to be withdrawn to restore consistency.
Dr de Kleer reckons that a TMS could be used to help machines diagnose themselves--predictably, the Xerox researcher has photocopiers in mind. The idea is to build into the machine a logical model of how it should work: eg, ""if the roller turns, the paper will be drawn into the slot"". When something does not work, the symptoms would contradict the predictions of the logical model. The TMS could then see which of the model's assumptions led to those false predictions, and so diagnose the problem.
JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS
But in machines, as in people, logic is not the only way to reach a conclusion. One alternative is statistics. Instead of making assumptions that later have to be retracted, statistical reasoning uses probabilities to express the idea of ""maybe"". For example, one popular technique for statistical reasoning, called fuzzy logic, expresses the idea that someone is tall in terms of the probabilities that someone of a given height would be considered tall. So a five-foot man might have a 10% chance of being regarded as tall, while a six-footer would have a 60% chance, and so on. A machine can then reason by combining probabilities. For example, it could use the chance that someone is tall, together with the chance that he is fat, to calculate the chance that he can fit into a small car.
The attractive thing about all the techniques for combining probabilities is that they work with a continuous range of values, not just the narrow-minded pair, ""true"" and ""false"". This makes them wonderful for controlling machinery. If the clothes are very dirty, the machine washes them very hard; not-so-dirty clothes get a not-so-hard wash; and so flexibly on through the scale of dirtiness. Japanese companies are taking advantage of these abilities by building fuzzy logic into machines ranging from vacuum cleaners to passenger trains.
Statistical reasoners, however, are not much good for repairing, say, photocopiers: one cannot replace 60% of a roller. Another snag with most forms of statistical reasoning is that they only approximate the real rules of statistics, so their conclusions are only approximately right. Although exactly the sort of statistical theories that computer-reasoners would like to use were thoughtfully created in the 18th century by Thomas Bayes, a British philosopher, their accuracy depends on keeping track of the interdependence of various sorts of evidence. If A serves as evidence for B while B serves as evidence for A, a naive statistical reasoner can create certainty from a mere fragment of evidence for either. In recent years, however, Judea Pearl of the University of California at Los Angeles and others have found ways to cope with such tricky interdependence, and more accurate Bayesian reasoners are being tested in several laboratories.
When neither statistics nor logic will do, yet another alternative is to proceed by analogy and example. Janet Kolodner of the Georgia Institute of Technology has created methods of ""case-based reasoning"" to let computers solve problems by finding a precedent. One ambitious use of this is evolving at Compaq Computer, which is using a case-based reasoning tool created by Inference. This lets technicians at Compaq's support centre type in the symptoms of a sick computer and retrieve the cure that has been recommended for similar symptoms in the past. If the symptoms are unfamiliar, or a previous cure does not work, Inference's tool makes a new entry for whatever cure the technician comes up with, so that others will gain the benefit of his experience.
One snag with case-based reasoning, as Katia Sycara of Carnegie-Mellon points out, is giving the computer a reasonable idea of similarity so that it can find relevant precedents. This restricts its use to problems that can be described clearly and simply. And even in the technical languages of computer faults, according to Brad Allen of Inference, everybody involved in the systems needs to get together regularly to make sure they are speaking the same language.
ONLY CONNECT
For most of the history of AI, it has been assumed that the mind is best understood in its own terms: as a collection of ideas and arguments. Over the past decade, however, more researchers have begun to wonder if it might not be better to look at the circuitry of the brain. Efforts to recreate similar circuitry on silicon have shed new light on some areas, including speech and vision.
At first glance, the brain is not a particularly impressive piece of engineering. Its basic circuitry, the neuron, works at a pace measured in thousandths of seconds. The pace of a digital computer, by contrast, is measured in billionths of seconds. But in about a tenth of a second the brain can recognise a friend's face or do any number of other things which a computer cannot. How come?
A big part of the answer lies in teamwork. Although neurons may individually be weaklings, there are a lot of them. They work on problems together, each sharing a bit of the job. A variety of different researchers are now trying to replicate this style of ""parallel distributed processing""--sometimes called connectionism--on computers.
Some of these creations are impressive. Tommy Poggio at MIT has created parallel programs that can recognise faces, which no conventional AI program can do. Terence Sejnowski of the Salk Institute has created a connectionist net that can pronounce English. But nets also have big drawbacks.
TRY, TRY AGAIN
One fundamental problem is that the inner workings of most nets defy exact comprehension. Each net is composed of a few hundred or a few thousand simple processors, called nodes. The nodes are wired so that each one can send signals to several others, and the signals that each node sends out depend on the ones it receives. So sending a signal into a connectionist net results in a ricocheting flurry of signals, counter-signals and counter-counter signals. The trick to making a net do useful computations lies in ensuring that this flurry will eventually settle down into a stable pattern of signals, which can be thought of as the ""answer"" to the ""question"" represented by the input.
Guaranteeing that there will be such an answer has been one of the bugbears of connectionism. There is too much going on in a net at once for it to be possible to program it by specifying exactly how each node should respond to each combination of signals. In the early 1960s Frank Rosenblatt showed that by connecting nodes in a particular way he could create devices, called perceptrons, that can be ""programmed"" by example.
Each node of a perceptron can do simple calculations like adding and subtracting as well as sending and receiving signals. To decide which signal to send, a node adds up its inputs. Before adding, however, it multiplies each input by an arbitrary ""weight"". Positive weights make the node more likely to fire if it receives that signal; negative weights make it less likely. Perceptrons are ""programmed"" by giving them an input, then adjusting the weights to make the output more like the ""right"" answer. Dr Rosenblatt found a straightforward technique for adjusting the weights that enabled perceptrons to be trained to compute by repeated cycles of showing them examples and fiddling with weights.
Unfortunately, a few years after he did this, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert at MIT wrote a book in which they pointed out that, although it was wonderful that perceptrons could be trained to compute, they could not in fact compute anything very interesting. Though more intricate networks can compute anything a computer can, there is no guarantee that they can be trained. The book killed connectionist research for about a decade. Then a new generation of researchers began experimenting with more powerful nets to see what they would do. They found that in practice the nets could be trained by more or less the same techniques that work for perceptrons. And they displayed some advantages over conventional computing, including:
* SPEED. Nets and other parallel programs can take account of a lot of information at once. Instead of working through a picture one bit at a time, as conventional computers painstakingly do, a picture can be fed into a net so that each bit is the input to a separate node. All the information contained in the picture is then considered simultaneously in a flurry of computation.
* RELIABILITY. Because computing is distributed all over a parallel system, the system can usually soldier on if a few nodes break down, or if part of the input is not exactly what is expected.
* GENERALISATION. The real wonder of connectionist nets is that training teaches them to recognise more than just the specific set of examples that they have already seen. They can also recognise things that resemble the training examples. David Rumelhart of Stanford University, one of those responsible for the rebirth of connectionist research, points out that the nets' ability to recognise things that are somehow ""in-between"" the examples they have seen allows them to capture the variety inherent in everyday ideas. It is hard to come up with words to encompass the many forms of ""cup"". Yet some nets seem to grasp it automatically after being trained on a few examples.
JUST DIGGING THE VIBES
Getting a grip on this remarkable ability to generalise has provided much of the excitement in connectionist research. At Carnegie-Mellon, researchers in the NavLab project use a connectionist net to enable their self-driving vehicle to recognise where the road is by looking at the picture from a videocamera mounted on the front of the van. Conventional programs could not cope with the many subtle signs that can indicate the twists and turns of asphalt. Nets can do better, but they are not perfect. The NavLab's nets, according to one of their developers, can be trained to recognise country roads, or suburban streets, or highways. But they cannot, for example, turn off a highway onto a country road.
Dr Poggio explains the generalising skills of nets as a complex form of interpolation. In effect, he argues, training a net to recognise a series of faces builds up a composite idea of a face in much the same way that a police artist might draw up a composite picture of a suspect by combining several sketches drawn from witnesses' descriptions. Armed with a mathematical theory of how this interpolation works, he has shown that the nets' abilities can be manipulated in novel ways.
One trick that can be worked with Dr Poggio's nets is to get them to display an ""archetype"" of, say, a woman's face by displaying a face which is least unlike all of the features of all the women's faces it has seen. Not surprisingly, the archetypal woman's face looks different from the archetypal man's face. More intriguing, however, is the ability of nets to do simple animation by interpolating between specific examples. Dr Poggio has made a net rotate a cartoon head, for example, by training the net with a full-face picture, a profile and a three-quarter profile, and then asking it to interpolate the in-between images.
The pattern-recognising and pattern-manipulating skills of connectionist nets are now being tried out on jobs ranging from recognising parts on a factory assembly line to winnowing out patterns in the price movements of securities. There have been some successes, but nets are by no means the answer to everything that enthusiasts sometimes claim. One practical problem is that it takes a long time to train them. A more fundamental one is that nets can neither explain why they have reached a conclusion nor follow what people would call a logical argument. If a net tells a stockbroker to sell 1m IBM shares, he has no alternative but to trust it, which is asking a lot of both man and machine.
SOUND AND FURY
Few skills seem more quintessentially intelligent than vision or speech. Both have ranked high on AI's agenda since its inception. But progress has been frustrating. Vision and language turn out to be too quintessentially intelligent. Complete solutions to the problems they pose depend on solutions to almost every other problem in AI.
To see what is so troublesome about language, consider the question ""Do you have the time?"". To understand why the appropriate answer is not simply ""yes"" or ""no"" requires a wealth of knowledge about human intentions, the practicalities of telling time and so on. Machines do not have either that knowledge or the reasoning skills that would let them use it. Similarly, even if a computer-vision system could manage to see objects in a factory, it would not appreciate that the yellow blur of a fork-lift truck might be more important than the parts on the assembly line--if the truck was coming straight towards it.
That said, some of the techniques that have proved inadequate for solving all the problems of language or vision can be honed to work on parts of them. And while theoreticians ponder what light computer models might help to shed on how people really see and talk, more practical researchers are looking for problems to fit the tools that the theoreticians have already created.
SEE THE LIGHT
From the start, vision researchers have known how to transform a picture into rows and columns of numbers, with each number representing the brightness of a point in the picture. What they have spent decades working out are ways of transforming that mind-numbing field of numbers into the beginnings of useful information.
Over the years they have built up an impressive array of techniques. Traditional ones have drawn heavily on the mathematics of signal processing, originally created for radio and television. More recently, these have been joined by methods relying on the power of connectionist nets. At MIT, Tommy Poggio and his graduate students and colleagues have been building an ambitious ""Vision Machine"" to experiment with ways of combining various sorts of visual information--depth, colour, texture and so on--in order to recognise objects.
In practice, the way to get computer-vision systems to work is simply to give them something very precise to look for. British Petroleum, for example, uses computer vision to help scan micro-photographs of earth taken from drilling samples to find the tiny fossil shells that can provide clues to help find oil. It has also adapted vision techniques to help analyse the results of a type of oil exploration that uses an airborne laser to scan large areas of ground, looking for a particular wavelength of light that indicates hydrocarbons seeping from the soil.
Today's biggest commercial prize in computer vision, however, is text and handwriting. To make computers easier to use, any number of companies are trying to make machines that can recognise the scrawl of handwriting. They are trying several tacks. Some use neural nets. Another approach is to have teams of automated specialists, each of which looks for a particular feature of a letter--say the descending stroke of a ""g"" or a ""j""--and which then pool their results. So far, research has created systems that can usually recognise printed text, in which the characters are well separated from one another. But they all find joined-up writing too muddling. A market probably worth billions for ""pen-based computers"" awaits a solution.
HEAR THE WORD
Research aimed at teaching computers to cope with human language shows a similar contrast between research into general tools and applications to specific problems. Here the most generally applied tool is called a parser, and its job is to break a sentence down into nouns, verbs and other parts of speech. Having this information makes language much easier to deal with; plenty of hard work has gone into creating parsers that can recognise the various tenses of verbs, decide when a verb needs an object, capture the essential similarity of, say, the active and passive forms of a sentence, and so on. But all of this is far from enough to understand language.
One problem with parsers is that most are flummoxed by ungrammatical sentences, whereas people can usually salvage some meaning out of them. A more fundamental problem with parsing is that it looks only at the structure of language. And structure is not enough to determine why ""the children are ready to eat the porridge"" makes sense, while ""the porridge is ready to eat the children"" does not.
Finding a complete solution to such problems will require huge improvements to computers' knowledge and reasoning abilities. But--as with vision--ingenious researchers are finding useful incomplete solutions.
One growing application of language-processing is the classification of messages. For example, Chase Manhattan and other American banks automatically forward incoming telexes to the right department using a program called PRISM, developed by Cognitive Systems, a small company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In this narrow realm, it can be confident of not meeting any carnivorous breakfast cereals. PRISM tackles telexes with a combination of parsing, inductive learning and case-based reasoning. Although it classifies only about three-quarters of its telexes correctly, that is not much worse than people manage to do.
Another growing application of computers' linguistic skills lies in providing an easy-to-use way of interrogating big databases. Here the trick is to enable the computer to use the structure inherent in the database to help it resolve the ambiguities of languages. And though for simple databases it is still easier to get people to learn computer languages rather than vice versa, for complex databases there is a variety of products which promise to let a person type in more-or-less English and get an answer that usually more or less makes sense. One such is Intellect from AICorp, which is now being used by over 300 companies around the world.
Researchers also have high hopes for machine translation. Although computers are nowhere near good enough to produce finished copy, organisations ranging from IBM to the European Commission are trying them out at producing rough drafts of translations for a person to polish. Canadians, meanwhile, have been listening to machine-translated weather reports for several years.
A further challenge is for computers to cope with spoken as well as written messages. The obvious complication is to translate sounds into words. So far researchers have managed to work that trick reliably only when the words are all separated by a bit of silence, and when there are only a limited number of words to consider. But within those limitations, real progress is being made. IBM has teamed up with a small company called Dragon Systems to produce an ""automated typist"" that can recognise 7,000 different words and runs on a personal computer. Raymond Kurzweil of Kurzweil Intelligent Systems in Waltham, Massachusetts, sells a system that enables doctors to dictate reports to a computer while their hands are busy doing something messy.
More capable machines are wending their way out of the laboratoriess. At MIT, Victor Zue and his team are working on a system called Voyager, which--haltingly, but astonishingly--can answer spoken questions about how to find one's way around the city of Cambridge. Like PRISM, Voyager works because it knows what sort of questions to expect, and it can use this knowledge together with information from sound and parsing.
DOING THE RIGHT THING
If, as Jean-Paul Sartre might have said, to do is to be, then today's artificial intelligences are not. The progress of computers as doers has lagged behind even their fitful progress as thinkers. Like all machines, they can mindlessly repeat actions. But they have severe difficulty in planning them, and even more in recovering when, as inevitably happens, a plan goes awry. Unless they get better at planning, even the brainiest of machines will remain armchair generals.
The challenges of planning are threefold. One is the perennial problem of knowledge: machines still have a long-way to go before they know what is doable. Another is the lack of a reliable ability to look far enough ahead before acting. Computers are still frequently confounded when one step in their carefully laid plans undoes some work that has been done before. Last, and perhaps trickiest, is the necessity for speed. Even when computers can work out the right thing to do, their thought processes are often so cumbersome that they come to the answer long after the chance to apply it has passed.
Facing up to such problems has sparked one of AI's hottest debates. Traditionally, researchers have tackled the problems of planning and doing with the same reasoning tools with which they have tackled every other AI problem. Now a small but vocal minority, led by Rodney Brooks of MIT, argues that machines would often be more intelligent if they discarded rationality. Dr Brooks argues that AI researchers should model their efforts on insects, not on people. He reckons that insect behaviour is a complex set of automatic reactions to the stimuli of the world, and he is trying to replicate that behaviour in silicon circuitry. But he has yet to bring a robot even to bug-like levels of skill.
LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP
The grandfather of the ""traditional"" approach to planning is SHAKEY, a robot mentioned earlier which was built in the early 1970s by Nils Nilsson, Richard Fikes and others at the Stanford Research Institute. SHAKEY could do simple things with blocks, such as pushing them about the floor. At the time this was quite an achievement.
The planning part of SHAKEY was a program called STRIPS that was equipped with knowledge of a repertoire of things that SHAKEY could do: eg, push a block up a ramp to place it on top of another block, push it back down, and so on. To plan its way towards some goal, STRIPS looked to see which of SHAKEY's skills could help to achieve it. If that skill could be applied, it was added to the plan; if it could not, STRIPS postponed its original goal and began trying to plan a way to let SHAKEY do the next envisioned step in the plan--returning to the original goal only after that is achieved.
Where STRIPS gets muddled, however, is if one step undoes the work of a previous step. Then it can find itself repeatedly doing and undoing the same work. One way of getting round this, called plan repair, is to try to detect such cycles of futility and purge them. A better way, most researchers now reckon, is to try to stop them arising.
""Non-linear"" planning techniques, developed in the late 1970s and 1980s by, among others, Austin Tate of Edinburgh University, consider the possible interaction of steps in a plan from the very beginning. To make this work, however, such planners must think of their world in a much more complicated way than STRIPS does. Instead of proceeding step-by-step, non-linear planners build up a collection of partially finished plans, specified at various levels of detail, and proceed by interleaving one partially finished plan into another.
JUST DO IT
Apart from the sheer cumbersomeness of planning, would-be rational robots suffer from a minimal grasp of cause and effect. If you move one block, which others will move too?
Rather than have machines spend hours pondering such mysteries, Dr Brooks, and Jean-Luc Steels at the Free University of Brussels, want to endow each machine with a repertoire of ""instinctive"" skills, each triggered automatically in response to some stimulus. By cleverly organising the interplay of these instincts, they believe they can create machines that are in many ways more capable than those that have to ponder every action.
The favourite testing ground for Dr Brooks's ideas are terrier-sized, six-legged robots called GHENGIS and ATILLA. The skills of such robots are organised in a hierarchy. At the bottom levels are basic skills like ""walking"" and ""avoiding obstacles"". When all is going well, these can be overridden by more advanced skills, such as ""looking around"" or ""approaching an interesting object"". But if the robot falls over or bumps into something, the lower instincts reassert control. Eventually, Dr Brooks hopes to build cheap, simple robots that can do tasks like cleaning dust off a floor or barnacles off a ship. But there is still a long way to go.
Meanwhile, the debate sparked by Dr Brooks's ideas has prompted all sorts of experiments. Although few researchers go along with him in abandoning contemplation, more question whether it is really necessary to ponder everything.
At the University of Edinburgh, Chris Malcolm is trying to improve robots' assembly skills by combining planning and instinct--with promising results. His idea is to endow the robot with a set of basic, instinctive patterns of behaviour that are flexible enough to overcome small mistakes in planning. The robot can then make its plans without getting bogged down in the details of everything that might go wrong.
BROTHER ROBOT
How intelligent can machines become? Philosophers and scientists have inconclusively debated this question since before the computer age. Intriguingly, some of the issues that have shaped the philosophical debate are now beginning to crop up in practical decisions over where and how to apply AI. They concern words and will--and, whether or not answering them creates true artificial intelligences, it seems likely to change the experience of being human.
One of the reasons put forward for believing in the impossibility of truly intelligent machines is simply that machines are created by people. This, it is argued, makes them man's slaves rather than his equals. They do whatever he wants them to--or, in the jargon of the debate, machines have ""derived intent"" while only humans have ""original intent"".
Computers themselves are now presenting a more practical side to this debate. From the most human of motives, namely laziness, people are giving machines more and more responsibility. It is simply easier if the machine flies the aircraft, or reorders the inventory, or works out today's manufacturing plan. The more complex the tasks that machines take on, the more they are being asked to behave as if they had will and purpose of their own.
The programmer of an auto-pilot cannot anticipate every movement of the flaps and every twist of the rudder on a long voyage--nor would he want to. He gives the auto-pilot a goal, and trusts that the machine has the skills to get on with it (though, just to make sure, a human pilot periodically peeks over the machine's shoulder). In this way the use of machines begins to shade over the indistinct border between the design and manipulation of inanimate objects (engineering) to the negotiation and alignment of goals (management).
The trend looks set to continue. Computer-makers everywhere are trying to make their machines more ""user-friendly"". But, as Candy Sidner Of DEC's Cambridge Research Laboratory points out, the sentence ""Can I help?"" is loaded with intention. To utter it with any real meaning, a machine must have some idea of what it can do, what the person is trying to do--and some way of appreciating how a person's goals and skills and its own can be aligned to a common purpose.
WHERE THERE'S A WILL
Such alignment implies that there is some common ground where each can understand the other. And to do that, both must at least roughly agree on the meanings of words. Some sceptics doubt that computers will in fact ever be able to do that.
One exponent of this view is Terry Winograd of Stanford University. In 1971 Dr Winograd created a program called SHRDLU which was the first to demonstrate that a machine could have any real grasp of language. But Dr Winograd soon became convinced that, although a machine could have some grasp of language, a complete grasp would always elude it. Inspired by a German philosopher, Martin Heidegger, Dr Winograd argues that the meaning of human words is inextricably bound up with human activity. And human activity, in turn, is inextricably bound up with being in a particular body, living a particular life, in a particular culture at a particular place and time.
An experiment conducted at London's Imperial College illustrates the point. Marek Sergot and Robert Kowalski wrote a program to interpret the British Nationalities Act. The logic of the law, they found, could relatively easily be mastered by the machine. But it proved largely impossible to explain the meaning of phrases like ""of good character"", ""intent to reside"" and so on to the machine. As a purely practical matter, such difficulties with words are not, argues Dr Sergot, a fundamental impediment. In law many words have precise, though somewhat artificial legal meanings that a machine can grasp. If legal verbiage still eludes the machine, it can simply phrase its advice in the form ""if you think he is 'of good character' then this law applies, otherwise that law does"".
In a sense, such practical solutions solve the problem by flipping it on its head. Instead of teaching machines the full meaning of words, people simply agree to work with meanings that the machines can understand. This alters the way in which words develop their meanings in the first place. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition of common law, at least, many words are left vague on purpose so that they can be redefined in the courtroom by a jury, thus helping the law to evolve in step with society.
NEW WORLD
Had the quest for AI succeeded in creating artificial people, getting machines to do jobs that are now done by people would have had little impact on anything except the economics of employment. Instead, it is doing something more revolutionary. To the extent that AI, together with the rest of information technology, has created tools worth using, it is starting to cause a deeper social transformation, by affecting the flow of information and ideas by which people define their culture.
Such change is not without precedent. Books and television have transformed the flow of information. The industrial revolution transformed work by applying machinery. But just as the industrial revolution was marked by a long apprenticeship of learning how to share work with machines, so too will the decades ahead be marked by a long apprenticeship of learning how to share information and decision-making with machines.
In the law, for example, the convenience of quicker, more predictable decision-making by computer may be worth the price of fewer arguments in the court room. Continental European countries have for centuries lived with a system of administrative law, derived from Roman tradition, in which juries and case law have little role to play. But learning how to make decisions in harmony with other people is hard enough; learning how to share decision-making with a machine is harder still. To glimpse some of the pitfalls that lie ahead, look at hospitals.
In many parts of medicine, computers have been doing better than doctors on tests of diagnostic ability for nearly two decades. But no hospital relies on a computer in diagnosis. One problem, points out Peter Szolovits of MIT, is that good performance on average is not enough in medicine. It is no good being brilliant on 96% of your patients if you stupidly kill the other 4%. The narrow abilities of today's artificial intelligences provide no firm guarantees that they will not do that.
One practical solution might be to put computers to work advising doctors, so that the doctor can make sure that the computer does not do anything stupid and vice versa. Here a more fundamental problem arises: time. Dr Szolovits recalls demonstrating an expert system to a heart specialist. The doctor was impressed by the computer's capabilities, but pointed out that he had spent 25 minutes typing questions and data into the machine for each case--and he saw 30-40 patients a day. Although a doctor's assistant might have more time to do the typing, he lacks the knowledge to take advantage of the machine's capabilities. He cannot know when to ask questions, which questions to ask or when to challenge the machine's assumptions.
Despite these pitfalls, the allure of AI is strong enough for the technology to be making gradual headway in hospitals--particularly in the role of error-catcher, looking at orders for treatment filed electronically by doctors into a hospital database and warning of potential hazards. But the medical history of AI highlights an uncomfortable fact: that the greatest obstacle to more intelligent machines is unintelligent people. Much though computer companies would like to promote the illusion that owning a clever, powerful computer will somehow make you a cleverer, more powerful person, it will not. However full of answers an artificial intelligence may be, it is of limited use to someone who does not understand the questions in the first place.
The history of science is filled with illustrations of the principle that intelligence is in large part in the eye of the beholder. Just as scientists have rejected theories whose importance or workings they could not understand, so too will people reject machines that do not speak their language. AI has a bright future in promoting human intelligence--helping with deductions, providing memory aids, detail-handlers, tutors and so on. But neither people nor machines can provide answers better than the questions they are asked. It is up to people to make sure that the questions are good ones."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224156778/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/65?accountid=14657,"One of the hardest topics of debate in artificial intelligence is what sort of subject it is. Some researchers reckon that AI is a science, whose goal is to work alongside psychology and neurobiology to explain the working of mind and brain. Others believe AI to be part of engineering, whose raison d'etre is to make tools. In practice most researchers proceed as if the answer lay somewhere in between: AI aims to make useful tools whose design is inspired by the mind.
Though researchers have had, at best, mixed success in getting machines to mimic human thought, they have time and again demonstrated two points about humans. First, people want to believe in thinking machines--out of far or fascination or both. Second, they are notoriously poor at defining what it means to think. Perhaps because people have encountered thinking machines only in people-shaped packages, they tend to assume that if a machine can do one intelligent-looking thing it can--like a person--do them all.
The consequence is that even people who should know better are easily fooled by AI programs, and are deeply disappointed when they are fooled. In the late 1960s a program called ELIZA was popularly acclaimed as the world's first automated psychiatrist, even though its creator, Joseph Weizenbaum, denied that it was anything of the sort. In the mid-1970s SHAKEY, an experimental robot built at the Stanford Research Institute, was touted as the progenitor of a race of mechanical men--much to the horror of the researchers who built it. They tried to explain that SHAKEY could in fact barely navigate an empty corridor, let alone an obstacle-strewn factory floor.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS
One irony of the high expectations that AI seems irresistibly to engender is that it has made successes look like failures. As a mechanical man, SHAKEY was a flop. But techniques used by SHAKEY to plan its actions were instrumental in creating programs that help people to plan everything from factory production schedules to troop movements. One such program--originally developed by Ascent Technology, a small firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to help Delta Airlines allocate landing gates at busy airports--was used to help the deployment of men and materials in the Gulf war. America's Defence Department, which has supported most of that country's AI research, claimed that this one application paid back much of the investment it has so far made in AI.
Repeated cycles of enthusiasm and disappointment have also changed researchers' expectations of what an intelligent program should do. In the early days they hoped to find a general theory of intelligence; in 1956 Herbert Simon dubbed his second AI program, created with Allen Newell, also of Carnegie Mellon, the ""General Problem Solver"". Today most AI researchers have given up the dream of finding a general theory of intelligence. Instead they are filling a toolbox of problem-solving techniques, each one suited to different jobs.
This shift has highlighted differences of interest and approach within AI. Computer vision, for example, has evolved into a more or less separate discipline, which draws as much from theories of signal processing that would be familiar to a television engineer as it does from more abstract techniques for computer reasoning. And the traditional core of AI, computer reasoning, comprises three different (though not always distinct) main camps.
* One group--call them the humanists--takes its inspiration from psychology. It wants to discover how people think and then simulate those processes on a computer. So Messrs Newell and Simon based the design of the General Problem Solver on psychological experiments in which they got students to talk aloud about their efforts to solve logic problems. Although psychology and introspection have fuelled many advances in AI, it can sometimes be hard to predict when programs based on these techniques will break down and when they will work perfectly.
* Partly in order to achieve greater predictability, another group of researchers prefers to base AI programs on formal logic (a mathematical sort of science which attempts to codify the principles of valid reasoning). One achievement of the logicists has been to create new forms of ""non-monotonic"" logic. Chains of reasoning based on traditional logic fall apart if an assumption on which they depend turns out to be wrong, whereas non-monotonic systems of logic can recover and cope with the necessary readjustments.
* A third group reckons that both the logicists and the humanists are jumping the gun. This group--call them the structuralists--believes that the best way to simulate the workings of the mind is to recreate the information-processing capabilities of the brain. So the largest faction within this group, known as the connectionists, are building interconnected networks of artificial ""neurons"" on silicon, just like those found in real brains. Such ""neural networks"" turn out to have intriguing abilities.
These tools are being used to build AI systems that are very different to those commonly envisioned even a few years ago. Instead of big systems dispensing wisdom like some sage of old, the vast majority of today's artificial intelligences are small and barely noticeable. With a few exceptions, they do modest tasks, and are so deeply embedded within computer networks that their users often do not even know that they are there, working quietly to process motor-warranty claims, approve executive expense accounts or simply to help route telephone calls.
Steve Cross of America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, one of the administrators of the $35m or so which his agency provides for AI research each year, expects AI to blossom in the role of assistant, helping people rather than replacing them. In the wake of the cold war, he argues, the armed forces will have to become more flexible and quicker to respond to the unexpected. Yet they will have to do so with fewer people, particularly in logistics and support AI, he believes, can help.
Many computer companies share this view. Nathan Myrhvold--head of research at Microsoft, the world's biggest supplier of personal computer software--is keen on teaching computers to cope with commands in more-or-less English. IBM is bullish about computers that can understand simple spoken commands. Aldus, which makes desktop-publishing software, is said to be trying to incorporate a small expert system into its best-selling Pagemaker software, to help advise people on how to make better-looking documents. Thus, although jaded by the over-enthusiasm of AI researchers, businessmen are giving the technology a second look."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224159352/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/66?accountid=14657,"Businessmen have good reason to be sceptical of computers. In the 1960s computer salesmen told them that the mainframe computer would boost their productivity by helping to centralise decision-making. It didn't. In the 1970s and early 1980s computer salesmen said that mini-and micro-computers would boost productivity by helping to decentralise decision-making. They didn't. Then, by the mid-1980s, the salesmen were saying that AI would boost productivity by eliminating human decision-making altogether. And pigs will fly.
But despite--or, in some cases, because of--a healthy scepticism, AI has been making quite progress in business. In Japan it has inspired new products. In western countries it has mostly been put to work in the office, helping people to cope with the floods of information that computers have released. In both places the stage has been set for AI to shine over the next decade or so.
One pre requisite for the increased use of AI is simply computer muscle: AI techniques require plenty of processing power and computer memory. They work far better when they can get their data over a network rather than having it laboriously typed in.
With today's power, all sorts of tricks become possible. Matsushita, for example, has made a video camera that cuts out the jitter caused by shaky hands. It uses a technique to detect motion that was developed by computer-vision researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) On a multi-million-dollar supercomputer called a Connection Machine. With today's circuit-packed semiconductors, Matsushita has been able to adapt a version of this technique (albeit much simplified) on to a thumbnail-sized chip.
As processing power increases, so too will the practical uses of AI. But the driving force behind the use of more intelligent computers is not more capable technology: it is more intelligent managers and computer users.
FASTER, HARDER, SMARTER
Businessmen are discovering that information technology is frustratingly different from other forms of automation. The classic approach to automation is to break tasks down into smaller pieces. Frederick Taylor, a turn-of-the-century management theorist who created the modern production line, invented a discipline called ""scientific management"" that divided factory work, bolt by bolt, into simple, repetitive steps. Alfred Sloan, the creator of General Motors, devised a ""functional"" organisation of management which similarly separated white-collar workers into various classes of salesmen, accountants and so forth.
Such techniques made the growth of the 20th century's industrial giants possible, but they are now reaching the point of diminishing returns. Sheer economies of scale in production provide less competitive advantage than they did when Henry Ford made the Model T. Similarly, the disadvantages of classical management are becoming more burdensome now that change comes more often and more quickly. The disadvantages of dividing work to make it more manageable are bureaucracy, rigidity and inertia. Bureaucratic organisations are slow to notice the need to change, because no single person sees enough of the overall picture. And once organisations do realise the need, they are also slow to act: the division of labour means that even smallish changes to one job ripple through to a host of others, so even small changes require lots of reorganisation.
Some companies have resolved this conundrum by giving workers more and broader responsibilities. Instead of being asked, say, to ""expedite customer-complaint form 2-112/B"", workers are charged simply with ""solving the customers' technical problems"". One big (and as yet largely unresolved) difficulty is keeping these newly liberated problem-solvers working in harmony. Another related burden is making sure that they have all the information they need. On both counts, the technology of AI has already shown it can help.
POWER TO THE PEOPLE
At US West, a big American telecoms company, executives recently reorganised the customer-service department. So far, so boring. But instead of putting workers in charge of fixing a particular sort of fault, they have made them responsible for satisfying a certain number of customers--whatever the fault may be. To help these newly solicitous employees do their jobs, US West, together with consultants from the Carnegie Group, gave each worker a computer that contained a small expert system to advise him on whom he should talk to about getting various faults fixed.
Like any useful technology, AI is no panacea. Sometimes the technology just does not work. Sometimes the technology is badly managed. An American airline (which prefers to remain nameless) proved the fact that people do not like taking orders from a machine when it installed an expert system to schedule the work of maintenance engineers. The engineers simply rejected the system's plans and it had to be withdrawn. But when, after a suitable delay, the airline reintroduced more or less the same system for engineers to use when and if they wanted, it was much better received.
In all branches of industry there are experiments going on to see how fast-changing technology can improve fast-changing work practices. Amid all the chaos, finding the right match of technology and business is not easy. One sort of AI system that seems to be popping up in all sorts of places, however, is the expert system. The next article explains why."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224141810/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/67?accountid=14657,"They are the bureaucrats of AI: expert systems see life as a book of rules. They apply these rules rigorously, fairly and predictably. But they are utterly lost when they meet something that is not in the book. It is perhaps not surprising that mechanical bureaucrats have become the favourite creation of AI--and it is somewhat ironic that they have often been cast in the role of human-bureaucracy busters.
Rules are the very stuff of expert systems. The business of making such a system involves sitting down with an expert in the relevant field and trying to codify his knowledge. This knowledge is typically fed into the computer in the form of ""if...then..."" rules. Thus an expert system for the identification of trees might contain rules like:
If the season is winter and the tree has foliage, then the tree is evergreen.
If the tree is evergreen and the foliage is needle-shaped, then the tree is a pine.
If the tree is evergreen and the foliage is leaf-shaped and spiky, then the tree is a holly.
The expert system also contains a piece of software; called an inference engine, to apply these rules to whatever facts are fed in. Thus if a system with those rules were to be told that the season is winter and the tree has leaves, it would conclude that the tree is evergreen. It would then try to apply the rules about evergreen trees by finding out about the shape of the foliage. And so on, until it either reached a conclusion or ran out of rules to apply.
BY THE NUMBERS
Such simple, mechanical reasoning can go a surprisingly long way, provided there is a well-constructed collection of rules. One perennial problem, however, is the literal-mindedness of computers. Unless it is explicitly told how to do so, the machine has no way of translating the knowledge that, say, a tree is green in January into the more relevant fact that it has foliage in winter.
Given the amount of detail in which propositions have to be laid out for a computer to make use of them, another problem for expert systems is managing a profusion of rules. A typical system will have hundreds of them. Often more than one rule seems to be applicable. Finding away to choose between them is one of the hardest challenges for expert system designers; Because most expert systems have no way to retract a conclusion that has been drawn by applying the wrong rule, getting it right first time is crucial.
One technique for dealing with a confusion of rules, pioneered by MYCIN, the grandfather of expert systems, is to associate a number, called a certainty factor, with each assertion. This indicates how sure the system is about its truth. A certainty factor of one typically indicates that the system believes this ""fact"" absolutely; a factor of minus one indicates absolute disbelief; anything between the two indicates some measure of ignorance or doubt. As it applies rules, the system's inference engine also combines certainty factors. With this system, all applicable rules are typically applied at each opportunity. At the end the system adopts the conclusion with the highest certainty factor.
Another technique for managing the complexity of knowledge, originally proposed by Marvin Minsky of MIT, is to link intuitively related ideas together in ""frames"". In the human mind most ideas carry with them a fairly predictable set of associations. The idea of ""car"", for example, carries with it wheels, tyres, driving, roads and so on. Through clever programming, ideas can similarly be linked within the computer.
A third approach is to remove the limitation that an expert system cannot retract any inference drawn from its rules. Some inference engines do allow the system to back up and start again if a line of reasoning runs into a dead end. In this way it tries all possible combinations of rules, so the choice of which one to apply affects only how quickly a conclusion is reached.
Each of these techniques has its drawbacks. People turn out to be remarkably bad at estimating certainty factors. Getting the right combination of ideas in a frame can be frustratingly less intuitive than it first appears. And although backtracking over inferences that had led to a dead end allows the system to consider a broader range of possibilities, the time needed to do so can make it unusably slow.
CAUTION: MACHINE AT WORK
With time and experience, computer scientists have nevertheless built these technologies into ready-to-use packages. So-called expert-system shells, which a buyer can customise in order to apply to many fields of expertise, are available from several companies--including young firms like Inference in Los Angeles, Aion and Neuron Data, both of Palo Alto, California, alongside computer giants like IBM and DEC.
Even with the benefit of all these techniques, the range of expertise that can be captured by an expert system is limited to simple, self-contained jobs which require no commonsense reasoning. But in part because the trend in management over the past century has been to break jobs into smaller, and supposedly more manageable, pieces, there turn out to be many things that expert systems can do without stretching.
Because business procedures can often be expressed more easily as expert-system rules than as programs written in conventional computer languages, companies have discovered that they can be particularly useful to meet fast-changing competition. American Airlines used an expert-system shell from Inference to update the rules of its frequent-flyer benefits in order to keep up with rival airlines. California's state government uses an expert system to process employee travel claims--more reliably, it reckons, than people used to do.
Much of the innovation needed to make better use of a machine's skills is managerial rather than technical; what it takes is the creation of organisations that can use the machine's bureaucratic skills to reduce human bureaucracy. The rudiments of the task are straightforward. Get the expert systems working in close harness with people. The machine does the routine work by the rules; the person then has more scope to do the rest of the job, which is typically the parts requiring real human intelligence, commonsense and creativity.
For several years American Express has approved credit-card transactions this way. To cope with millions of transactions each day, it built an expert system, called the Authoriser's Assistant. About two-thirds of the transactions are so routine that the system can handle them itself. If it finds anything out of the ordinary, it hands the facts of the case over to a person for a final decision.
The bad news for managers trying to recreate such success stories is that changing the way people work together is one of the hardest things to do. The process is messy, and bright-sounding theories can founder on any number of apparently trivial details. The good news is that the technology itself is becoming more capable, which at least provides more room to manoeuvre in tackling the problems posed by people. To see how the machines are improving, start with the problem of knowledge."

Although computers can calculate pi to a thousand decimal places in the twinkling of an eye, they do not know any of the things that people learn in the playpen: such as that apples are to eat, that shoes are not, and that heads are more or less permanently attached to bodies.
In retrospect, one of the surprises of AI has been how far computers have got without such knowledge. Chess-playing programs have no more knowledge of the game than the rankest human amateur. They know the legal moves, and they have a simplistic idea of what Constitutes a good position: eg, having more pieces than the opponent. But they are completely ignorant of strategy. They make up for this ignorance by their ability to search through billions of possible sequences of moves in order to find the best one.
In the 1960s and 1970s, AI researchers found a number of elegant ways of organising such exhaustive, ""brute-force"" searches for solutions. American Airlines today uses one such technique to find routes for jetliners that will put them in the same cities as the maintenance facilities they need when they need them and not before.
In practice such techniques work only for problems in which the range of possible solutions is relatively limited; otherwise they are overwhelmed. In chess, for example, there are about 35 legal moves that can follow from each board position. Today's most powerful chess-playing computers can examine all those possibilities for 10-12 moves into the future, which is more than enough to play a good game. But in the Japanese game of Go there are 100 or so possible moves at each board position, and computers are just about useless.
JUST THE FACTS, MA'AM
Having bumped up against the limits of ignorance, AI researchers have become increasingly enthusiastic about knowledge. hope it will make their machines more efficient at reasoning, by enabling them to concentrate on relevant possibilities. They also hope it will make them less prone to moronic mistakes. More ambitiously, Mark Stefik of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre, and others, predict a new sort of publishing industry. Alongside ""do-it-yourself"" books will pop up ""do-it-itself"" software which, in addition to teaching a person, say, how to do his taxes in theory, can actually work through the forms with him.
This attractive vision raises several unanswered questions. First, how much knowledge would a ""do-it-itself book"" need? In the case of people, the magpie-like collection of facts that makes up commonsense knowledge comes as a complete package. Although it would be nice to give, say, a tax-accountancy expert system a basic idea of what money is, nobody really knows how to disentangle this idea from the mess of other facts in the human brain--or indeed if it can be disentangled at all. Must the idea of money include ""retirement"", for example? And if so, must it also include ""time""?
The most ambitious effort to answer these question is being undertaken by Doug Lenat and his colleagues at the Microelectronics and Computer Consortium, an industry-financed research group in Austin, Texas. Since 1986 Dr Lenat and his colleagues have been painstakingly typing knowledge into a computer called Cyc. By the mid-1990s they hope to equip Cyc with about 10m pieces of information. The hope is that it will then know about as much as a five-year-old--including a rough grasp of gravity, bodies, money, shopping, time, and fairy tales. With that much knowledge, Dr Lenat hopes that Cyc will be able to do a number of things that existing AI systems cannot do, including translate new ideas into concepts with which it is already familiar, and thus help to teach itself.
Meanwhile, Edward Feigenbaum and his colleagues at Stanford's Knowledge Systems Laboratory are taking a different approach to making more knowledgeable machines. Instead of typing in all the knowledge that a person might have, they want to enable a machine simply a share the knowledge that other computers already possess. The knowledge in today's expert systems is so tangled up with the structure of the programs themselves that it cannot be shared with any other system. So expert systems cannot co-operate in solving problems. Nor can the knowledge of one easily serve as the building-blocks for another.
UP IN THE MORNING AND OFF TO SCHOOL
The heart of the expert-system challenge is providing computers with a common core of concepts with which to describe the knowledge they would share. The more general descriptions need to be, the harder this becomes. For two computer-aided design (CAD) programs, say, to share knowledge about an engine part is relatively straightforward, because both think of parts in terms of geometry: ie, lines and dimensions. But for a CAD program to describe the same part to, say, a design expert system searching for a component, it would have to use a broader vocabulary of ideas to describe what the part might be used for. Tom Gruber at Stanford is leading a group trying to provide machines with just such concepts. Although the ability to reuse knowledge that has already been mastered by one system will provide huge practical benefits (and probably create a medium-sized industry or two of knowledge-providers) it will solve only part of the problem of creating more knowledgeable computers. For that, machines must be taught to learn.
Artificial-intelligence researchers do not, by and large, share the views of that great 17th-century philosopher, John Locke. They do not believe that the human mind begins as a blank slate, to be filled by experience. Most would argue that you need some knowledge first in order to learn. One prerequisite is a basic vocabulary of concepts, such as the one Dr Gruber is trying to create. Another, implicit, form of knowledge lies in the rules which govern the combining of these concepts to form new ideas.
Over the years the hope of letting machines learn from their own experiences has inspired the creation of a number of machine-learning techniques. One popular one, called inductive learning, picks up new ideas by sifting through a stream of concepts to find the common ground. For example, Patrick Winston of MIT wrote a program that could learn the concept of an arch by examining descriptions of simple structures made of blocks, and distilling common qualities of those which it was told were arches--thus learning that the colour of blocks was not relevant to ""archness"" but that their position was.
Another way of learning from experience is to generalise from past successes and failures. As it tries to solve problems, SOAR, a program created by Allen Newell of Carnegie-Mellon University and John Laid of the University of Michigan, keeps track of which liens of reasoning have turned out to be useful. When it comes up with a helpful line of reasoning, it stores it away, indexed by a description of the situation in which it helped.
Although several learning techniques are creeping into working systems, trying to get good results out of them can be frustrating. One problem is that the knowledge needed to learn inevitably introduces bias. And bias subtly affects what can be learnt. An inductive learner, trying to grasp the concept ""dog"", would classify the qualities of the examples it was shown into three categories: must-have (for those qualities that only dogs have); can't-have (for those that no dogs have); and don't-care (for qualities that only some dogs have). With this scheme it could learn that having a head can help distinguish a dog from a carrot, because all dogs have one head and no carrots do. But it could not learn that colour can help to distinguish a dog from a carrot, because dogs can be black, brown, white and so on, but not garish, bright orange.
A related problem is that the lessons man or machine can most profitably learn depend on what he wants to do with the knowledge--ie, what sort of reasoning he wants to use. And techniques for computer reasoning are changing fast."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139047/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/69?accountid=14657,"For centuries people have dreamed of a reasoning machine so powerful that it could eliminate human argument. A 17th-century mathematician and philosopher, Gottfried Leibniz, fantasised about devising logical techniques that would let any two philosophers settle any debate once and for all just by sitting down and ""calculating"". The more time people spend searching for the ultimate reasoning mechanism, the more evidence piles up that such things cannot exist.
Some things are just not decidable by logic--if they are logical problems. Although computer reasoners can be guaranteed to answer some (but only some) sorts of questions, they cannot be guaranteed to answer all questions of that sort. And even for the sort of work that automated reasoners can do, there is no guarantee that they will grind to a halt and reach a conclusion before the universe itself does.
Such realisations are humbling for researchers looking into computer reasoning. They would love to come up with ways of improving on human reasoning; but many would be happy just to devise ways of muddling along as well as people do. Even that is proving to be quite a challenge. The research is proceeding on two levels. Theoretically, the task is to come up with better theories for understanding reasoning. Practically, the task is building these new theories into working computer programs. Muddled progress is being made on both fronts.
WRONG AGAIN
Some of the most interesting results come from trying to extend the deductive procedures of formal logic to the real world. Historically, systems of logic were designed to study problems in which all the relevant facts are known and any new information is guaranteed not to contradict the old. Such assumptions turn out to be completely unrealistic for solving practical problems.
For example, conventional theories of logic are flummoxed by the introduction of anomalous terms such as ""penguin"". A useful assumption for anyone or anything that wants to reason about the world is that birds fly. Yet penguins are defined as birds, and penguins do not fly. Faced with such a contradiction, conventional logics must either give up the convenient assumption that birds can fly, or foreswear thinking about penguins. So-called non-monotonic logics can do better.
At the theoretical level, John McCarthy of Stanford University has proposed a theory called circumscription. This shows that most of the useful deductive tools of logic still apply if generalisations such as ""birds can fly"" are qualified by a phrase like ""assuming there is nothing abnormal about them"". And there are other variants on this approach.
At a practical level, the real work of non-monotonic reasoning is done by the wonderfully named ""truth-maintenance system"" (TMS), originally developed by Jon Doyle of MIT (and since improved upon by others, notably Johan de Kleer of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre). At heart, a truth-maintenance system is a sort of book-keeping device that keeps track of which conclusions depend on which premises. When a contradiction (eg, a flightless bird) is found, the TMS can work through the chain of reasoning to see which assumptions will have to be withdrawn to restore consistency.
Dr de Kleer reckons that a TMS could be used to help machines diagnose themselves--predictably, the Xerox researcher has photocopiers in mind. The idea is to build into the machine a logical model of how it should work: ""if the roller turns, the paper will be drawn into the slot"". When something does not work, the symptoms would contradict the predictions of the logical model. The TMS could then see which of the model's assumptions led to those false predictions, and so diagnose the problem.
JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS
But in machines, as in people, logic is not the only way to reach a conclusion. One alternative is statistics. Instead of making assumptions that later have to be retracted, statistical reasoning uses probabilities to express the idea of ""maybe"". For example, one popular tehnique for statistical reasoning, called fuzzy-logic, expresses the idea that someone is tall in terms of the probabilities that someone of a given height would be considered tall. So a five-foot man might have a 10% chance of being regarded as tall, while a six-footer would have a 60% chance, and so on. A machine can then reason by combining probabilities. For example, it could use the chance that someone is tall, together with the chance that he is fat, to calculate the chance that he can fit into a small car.
The attractive thing about all the techniques for combining probabilities is that they work with a continuous range of values, not just the narrow-minded pair, ""true and ""false"". This makes them wonderful for controlling machinery. If the clothes are very dirty, the machine washes them very hard; not-so-dirty clothes get a not-so-hard wash; and so flexibly on through the scale of dirtiness. Japanese companies are taking advantage of these abilities by building fuzzy logic into machines ranging from vacuum cleaners to passenger trains.
Statistical reasoners, however, are not much good for repairing, say, photocopiers: one cannot replace 60% of a roller. Another snag with most forms of statistical reasoning is that they only approximate the real rules of statistics, so their conclusions are only approximately right. Although exactly the sort of statistical theories that computer-reasoners would like to use were thoughtfully created in the 18th century by Thomas Bayes, a British philosopher, their accuracy depends on keeping track of the interdependence of various sorts of evidence. If A serves as evidence for B while B serves as evidence for A, a naive statistical reasoner can create certainty from a mere fragment of evidence for either. In recent years, however, Judea Pearl of the University of California at Los Angeles and others have found ways to cope with such tricky interdependence, and more accurate Bayesian reasoners are being tested in several laboratories.
When neither statistics nor logic will do, yet another alternative is to proceed by analogy and example. Janet Kolodner of the Georgia Institute of Technology has created methods of ""case-based reasoning"" to let computers solve problems by finding a precedent. One ambitious use of this is evolving at Compaq Computer, which is using a case-based reasoning tool created by Inference. This lets technicians at Compaq's support centre type in the symptoms of a sick computer and retrieve the cure that has been recommended for similar symptoms in the past. If the symptoms are unfamiliar, or a previous cure does not work, Inference's tool makes a new entry for whatever cure the technician comes up with, so that others will gain the benefit of his experience.
One snag with case-based reasoning, as Katia Sycara of Carnegie-Mellon points out, is giving the computer a reasonable idea of similarity so that it can find relevant precedents. This restricts its use to problems that can be described clearly and simply. And even in the technical languages of computer faults, according to Brad Allen of Inference, everybody involved in the systems needs to get together regularly to make sure they are speaking the same language."

Over the past decade, however, more researchers have begun to wonder if it might not be better to look at the circuitry of the brain. Efforts to recreate similar circuitry on silicon have shed new light on some areas, including speech and vision.
At first glance, the brain is not a particularly impressive piece of engineering. Its basic circuitry, the neuron, works at a pace measured in thousandths of seconds. The pace of a digital computer, by contrast, is measured in billionths of seconds. But in about a tenth of a second the brain can recognise a friend's face or do any number of other things which a computer cannot. How come?
A big part of the answer lies in teamwork. Although neurons may individually be weaklings, there are a lot of them. They work on problems together, each sharing a bit of the job. A variety of different researchers are now trying to replicate this style of ""parallel distributed processing""--sometimes called connectionism--on computers.
Some of these creations are impressive. Tommy Poggio at MIT has created parallel programs that can recognise faces, which no conventional AI program can do. Terence Sejnowski of the Salk Institute has created a connectionist net that can pronounce English. But nets also have big drawbacks.
TRY, TRY AGAIN
One fundamental problem is that the inner workings of most nets defy exact comprehension. Each net is composed of a few hundred or a few thousand simple processors, called nodes. The nodes are wired so that each one can send signals to several others, and the signals that each node sends out depend on the ones it receives. So sending a signal into a connectionist net results in a ricocheting flurry of signals, counter-signals and counter-counter signals. The trick to making a net do useful computations lies in ensuring that this flurry will eventually settle down into a stable pattern of signals, which can be thought of as the ""answer"" to the ""question"" represented by the input.
Guaranteeing that there will be such an answer has been one of the bugbears of connectionism. There is too much going on in a net at once for it to be possible to program it by specifying exactly how each node should respond to each combination of signals. In the early 1960s Frank Rosenblatt showed that by connecting nodes in a particular way he could create devices, called perceptrons, that can be ""programmed"" by example.
Each node of a perceptron can do simple calculations like adding and subtracting as well as sending and receiving signals. To decide which signal to send, a node adds up its inputs. Before adding, however, it multiplies each input by an arbitrary ""weight"". Positive weights make the node more likely to fire if it receives that signal; negative weights make it less likely. Perceptrons are ""programmed"" by giving them an input, then adjusting the weights to make the output more like the ""right"" answer. Dr Rosenblatt found a straightforward technique for adjusting the weighs that enabled perceptrons to be trained to compute by repeated cycles of showing them examples and fiddling with weights.
Unfortunately, a few years after he did this, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert at MIT wrote a book in which they pointed out that, although it was wonderful that perceptrons could be trained to compute, they could not in fact compute anything very interesting. Though more intricate networks can compute anything a computer can, there is no guarantee that they can be trained. The book killed connectionist research for about a decade. Then a new generation of researchers began experimenting with more powerful nets to see what they would do. They found that in practice the nets could be trained by more or less the same techniques that work for perceptrons. And they displayed some advantages over conventional computing, including:
* SPEED. Nets and other parallel programs can take account of a lot of information at once. Instead of working through a picture one bit at a time, as conventional computers painstakingly do, a picture can be fed into a net so that each bit is the input to a separate node. All the information contained in the picture is then considered simultaneously in a flurry of computation.
* RELIABILITY. Because computing is distributed all over a parallel system, the system can usually soldier on if a few nodes break down, or if part of the input is not exactly what is expected.
* GENERALISATION. The real wonder of connectionist nets is that training teaches them to recognise more than just the specific set of examples that they have already seen. They can also recognise things that resemble the training examples. David Rumelhart of Standard University, one of those responsible for the rebirth of connectionist research, points out that the nets' ability to recognise things that are somehow ""in-between"" the examples they have seen allows them to capture the variety inherent in everyday ideas. It is hard to come up with words to encompass the many forms of ""cup"". Yet some nets seem to grasp it automatically after being trained on a few examples.
JUST DIGGING THE VIBES
Getting a grip on this remarkable ability to generalise has provided much of the excitement in connectionist .research. At Carnegie-Mellon, researchers in the NavLab project use a connectionist net to enable their self-driving vehicle to recognise where the road is by looking at the picture from a videocamera mounted on the front of the van. Conventional programs could not cope with the many subtle signs that can indicate the twists and turns of asphalt. Nets can do better, but they are not perfect. The NavLab's nets, according to one of their developers, can be trained to recognise country roads, or suburban streets, or highways. But they cannot, for example, turn off a highway onto a country road.
Dr Poggio explains the generalising skills of nets as a complex form of interpolation. In effect, he argues, training a net to recognize a series of faces builds up a composite idea of a face in much the same way that a police artist might draw up a composite picture of a suspect by combining several sketches drawn from witnesses' descriptions. Armed with a mathematical theory of how this interpolation works, he has shown that the nets' abilities can be manipulated in novel ways.
One trick that can be worked with Dr Poggio's nets is to get them to display an ""archetype"" of, say, a woman's face by displaying a face which is least unlike all of the features of all the women's faces it has seen. Not surprisingly, the archetypal woman's face looks different from the archetypal man's face. More intriguing, however, is the ability of nets to do simple animation by interpolating between specific examples. Dr Poggio has made a net rotate a cartoon head, for example, by training the net with a full-face picture, a profile and a three-quarter profile, and then asking it to interpolate the in-between images.
The pattern-recognising and pattern-manipulating skills of connectionist nets are now being tried out on jobs ranging from recognizing parts on a factory assembly line to winnowing out patterns in the price movements of securities. There have been some successes, but nets are by no means the answer to everything that enthusiasts sometimes claim. One practical problem is that it takes a long time to train them. A more fundamental one is that nets can neither explain why they have reached a conclusion nor follow what people would call a logical argument. If a net tells a stockbroker to sell 1M IBM shares, he has no alternative but to trust it, which is asking a lot of both man and machine."
14-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224139133/fulltext/7B64439E285741B3PQ/71?accountid=14657,"Few skills seem more quintessentially intelligent than vision or speech. Both have ranked high on AI'S agenda since its inception. But progress has been frustrating. Vision and language turn out to be too quintessentially intelligent. Complete solutions to the problems they pose depend on solutions to almost every other problem in AI.
To see what is so troublesome about language, consider the question ""Do you have the time?"". To understand why the appropriate answer is not simply ""yes"" or ""no"" requires a wealth of knowledge about human intentions, the practicalities of telling time and so on, Machines do not have either that knowledge or the reasoning skills that would let them use it. Similarly, even if a computer-vision system could manage to see objects in a factory, it would not appreciate that the yellow blur of a forklift truck might be more important than the parts on the assembly line--if the truck was coming straight towards it.
That said, some of the techniques that have proved inadequate for solving all the problems of language or vision can be honed to work on parts of them. And while theoreticians ponder what light computer models might help to shed on how people really see and talk; more practical researchers are looking for problems to fit the tools that the theoreticians have already created.
SEE THE LIGHT
From the start, vision researchers have known how to transform a picture into rows and columns of numbers, with each number representing the brightness of a point in the picture. What they have spent decades working out are ways of transforming that mind-numbing field of numbers into the beginnings of useful information.
Over the years they have built up an impressive array of techniques. Traditional ones have drawn heavily on the mathematics of signal processing, originally created for radio and television. More recently, these have been joined by methods relying on the power of connectionist nets. At MIT, Tommy Poggio and his graduate students and colleagues have been building an ambitious ""Vision Machine"" to experiment with ways of combining various sorts of visual information--depth, colour, texture and so on--in order to recognise objects.
In practice, the way to get computer-vision systems to work is simply to give them something very precise to look for. British Petroleum, example, uses computer vision to help scan micro-photographs of earth taken from drilling samples to find the tiny fossil shells that can provide clues to help find oil. It has also adapted vision techniques to help analyse the results of a type of oil exploration that uses an airborne laser to scan large areas of ground, looking for a particular wavelength of light that indicates hydrocarbons seeping from the soil.
Today's biggest commercial prize in computer vision, however, is text and handwriting. To make computers easier to use, any number of companies are trying to make machines that can recognise the scrawl of handwriting. They are trying several tacks. Some use neural nets. Another approach is to have teams of automated specialists, each of which looks for a particular feature of a letter--say the descending stroke of a ""g"" or a ""j""--and which then pool their results. So far, research has created systems that can usually recognise printed text, in which the characters are well separated from one another. But they all find joined-up writing too muddling. A market probably worth billions for ""pen-based computers"" awaits a solution.
HEAR THE WORD
Research aimed at teaching computers to cope with human language shows a similar contrast between research into general tools and applications to specific problems. Here the most generally applied tool is called a parser, and its job is to break a sentence down into nouns, verbs and other parts of speech. Having this information makes language much easier to deal with; plenty of hard work has one into creating parsers that can recognise the various tenses of verbs, decide when a verb needs an object, capture the essential similarity of, say, the active and passive forms of a sentence, and so on. But all of this is far from enough to understand language.
One problem with parsers is that most are flummoxed by ungrammatical sentences, whereas people can usually salvage some meaning out of them. A more fundamental problem with parsing is that it looks only at the structure of language. And structure is not enough to determine why ""the children are ready to eat the porridge"" makes sense, while ""the porridge is ready to eat the children"" does not.
Finding a complete solution to such problems will require huge improvements to computers' knowledge and reasoning abilities. But--as with vision--ingenious researchers are finding useful incomplete solutions.
One growing application of language-processing is the classification of messages. For example, Chase Manhattan and other American banks automatically forward incoming telexes to the right department using a program called PRISM, developed by Cognitive Systems, a small company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In this narrow realm, it can be confident of not meeting any carnivorous breakfast cereals. PRISM tackles telexes with a combination of parsing, inductive learning and case-based reasoning. Although it classifies only about three-quarters of its telexes correctly, that is not much worse than people manage to do.
Another growing application of computers' linguistic skills lies in providing an easy-to-use way of interrogating big databases. Here the trick is to enable the computer to use the structure inherent in the database to help it resolve the ambiguities of languages. And though for simple databases it is still easier to get people to learn computer languages rather than vice versa, for complex databases there is a variety of products which promise to let a person type in more-or-less English and get an answer that usually more or less makes sense. One such is Intellect from AICORP, which is now being used by over 300 companies around the world.
Researchers also have high hopes for machine translation. Although computers are nowhere near good enough to produce finished copy, organisations ranging from IBM to the European Commission are trying them out at producing rough drafts of translations for a person to polish. Canadians, meanwhile, have been listening to machine-translated weather reports for several years.
A further challenge is for computers to cope with spoken as well as written messages. The obvious complication is to translate sounds into words. So far researchers have managed to work that trick reliably only when the words are all separated by a bit of silence, and when there are only a limited number of words to consider. But within those limitations, real press is being made. IBM has teamed up with a small company called Dragon Systems to produce an ""automated typist"" that can recognise 7,000 different words and runs on a personal computer. Raymond Kurzweil of Kurzweil Intelligent Systems in Waltham, Massachusetts, sells a system that enables doctors to dictate reports to a computer while their hands are busy doing something messy.
More capable machines are wending their way out of the laboratoriess. At MIT, Victor Zue and his team are working on a system called Voyager, which--haltingly, but astonishingly--can answer spoken questions about how to find one's way around the city of Cambridge. Like PRISM, Voyager works because it knows what sort of questions to expect, and it can use this knowledge together with information from sound and parsing."

The progress of computers as doers has lagged behind even their fitful progress as thinkers. Like all machines, they can mindlessly repeat actions. But they have severe difficulty in planning them, and even more in recovering when, as inevitably happens, a plan goes awry. Unless they get better at planning, even the brainiest of machines will remain armchair generals.
The challenges of planning are three-fold. One is the perennial problem of knowledge: machines still have a long way to go before they know what is doable. Another is the lack of a reliable ability to look far enough ahead before actin. Computers are still frequently confounded when one step in their carefully laid plans undoes some work that has been done before. Last, and perhaps trickiest, is the necessity for speed. Even when computers can work out the right thing to do, their thought processes are often so cumbersome that they come to the answer long after the chance to apply it has passed.
Facing up to such problems has sparked one of AI's hottest debates. Traditionally, researchers have tackled the problems of planning and doing with the same reasoning tools with which they have tackled every other AI problem. Now a small but vocal minority, led by Rodney Brooks of MIT, argues that machines would often be more intelligent if they discarded rationality. Dr Brooks argues that AI researchers should model their efforts on insects, not on people. He reckons that insect behaviour is a complex set of automatic reactions to the stimuli of the world, and he is trying to replicate that behaviour in silicon circuitry. But he has yet to bring a robot even to bug-like levels of skill.
LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP
The grandfather of the ""traditional"" approach to planning, is SHAKEY, a robot mentioned earlier which was built in the early 1970s by Nils Nilsson, Richard Fikes and others at the Stanford Research Institute. SHAKEY could do simple things with blocks, such as pushing them about the floor. At the time this was quite an achievement.
The planning part of SHAKEY was a program called STRIPS that was equipped with knowledge of a repertoire of things that SHAKEY could do: eg, push a block up a ramp to place it on top of another block, push it back down, and so on. To plan its way towards some goal, STRIPS looked to see which of SHAKEY'S skills could help to achieve it. If that skill could be applied, it was added to the plan; if it could not, STRIPS postponed its original goal and began trying to plan a way to let SHAKEY do the next envisioned step in the plan--returning to the original goal only after that is achieved.
Where STRIPS gets muddled, however, is if one step undoes the work of a previous step. Then it can find itself repeatedly doing and undoing the same work. One way of getting round this, called plan repair, is to try to detect such cycles of futility and purge them. A better way, most researchers now reckon, is to try to stop them arising.
""Non-linear"" planning techniques, developed in the late 1970s and 1980s by, among others, Austin Tate of Edinburgh University, consider the possible interaction of steps in a plan from the very beinning. To make this work, however, such planners must think of their world in a much more complicated way than STRIPS does. Instead of proceeding step-by-step, non-linear planners build up a collection of partially finished plans, specified at various levels of detail, and proceed by interleaving one partially finished plan into another.
JUST DO IT
Apart from the sheer cumbersomeness of planning, would-be rational robots suffer from a minimal grasp of cause and effect. If you move one block, which others will move too?
Rather than have machines spend hours pondering such mysteries, Dr Brooks, and Jean-Luc Steels at the Free University of Brussels, want to endow each machine with a repertoire of ""instinctive"" skills, each triggered automatically in response to some stimulus. By cleverly organising the interplay of these instincts, they believe they can create machines that are in many ways more capable than those that have to ponder every action.
The favourite testing ground for Dr Brooks's ideas are terrier-sized, six-legged robots called GHENGIS and ATILLA. The skills of such robots are organised in a hierarchy. At the bottom levels are basic skills like ""walking"" and ""avoiding obstacles"". When all is going well, these can be overridden by more advanced skills, such as ""looking around"" or ""approaching an interesting object"". But if the robot falls over or bumps into something, the lower instincts reassert control. Eventually, Dr Brooks hopes to build cheap, simple robots that can do tasks like cleaning dust off a floor or barnacles off a ship. But there is still a long way to go.
Meanwhile, the debate sparked by Dr Brooks's ideas has prompted all sorts of experiments. Although few researchers go along with him in abandoning contemplation, more question whether it is really necessary to ponder everything.
At the University of Edinburgh, Chris Malcolm is trying to improve robots' assembly skills by combining planning and instinct--with promising results. His idea is to endow the robot with a set of basic, instinctive patterns of behaviour that are flexible enough to overcome small mistakes in planning. The robot can then make its plans without getting bogged down in the details of everything that might go wrong."

Philosophers and scientists have inconclusively debated this question since before the computer age. Intriguingly, some of the issues that have shaped the philosophical debate are now beginning to crop up in practical decisions over where and how to apply AI. They concern words and will-and, whether or not answering them creates true artificial intelligences, it seems likely to change the experience of being human.
One of the reasons put forward for believing in the impossibility of truly intelligent machines is simply that machines are created by people. This, it is argued, makes them man's slaves rather than his equals. They do whatever he wants them to--or, in the jargon of the debate, machines have ""derived intent"" while only humans have ""original intent"".
Computers themselves are now presenting a more practical side to this debate. From the most human of motives, namely laziness, people are giving machines more and more responsibility. It is simply easier if the machine flies the aircraft, or reorders the inventory, or works out today's manufacturing plan. The more complex the tasks that machines take on, the more they are being asked to behave as if they had will and purpose of their own.
The programmer of an auto-pilot cannot anticipate every movement of the flaps and very twist of the rudder on a long voyage-nor would he want to. He gives the auto-pilot a goal, and trusts that the machine has the skills to get on with it (though, just to make sure, a human pilot periodically peeks over the machine's shoulder). In this way the use of machines begins to shade over the indistinct border between the design and manipulation of inanimate objects (engineering) to the negotiation and alignment of goals (management).
The trend looks et to continue. Computer-makers everywhere are trying to make their machines more ""user-friendly"". But, as Candy Sidner of DEC'S Cambridge Research Laboratory points out, the sentence ""Can I help?"" is loaded with intention. To utter it with any real meaning, a machine must have some idea of what it can do, what the person is trying to do--and some way of appreciating how a person's goals and skills and its own can be aligned to a common purpose.
WHERE THERE'S A WILL
Such alignment implies that there is some common ground where each can understand the other. And to do that, both must at least roughly agree on the meanings of words. Some sceptics doubt that computers will in fact ever be able to do that.
One exponent of this view is Terry Winograd of Stanford University. In 1971 Dr Winograd created a program called SHRDLU which was the first to demonstrate that a machine could have any real grasp of language. But Dr Winograd soon became convinced that, although a machine could have some grasp of language, a complete grasp would always elude it. Inspired by a German philosopher, Martin Heidegger, Dr Winograd argues that the meaning of human words is inextricably bound up with human activity. And human activity, in turn, is inextricably bound up with being in a particular body, living a particular life, in a particular culture at a particular place and time.
An experiment conducted at London's Imperial College illustrates the point. Marek Sergot and Robert Kowalski wrote a program to interpret the British Nationalities Act. The logic of the law, they found, could relatively easily be mastered by the machine. But it proved largely impossible to explain the meaning of phrases like ""of good chacter"", ""intent to reside"" and so on to the machine. As a pure practical matter, such difficulties with words are not, argues Dr Sergot, a fundamental impediment. In law many words have precise, though somewhat artificial legal meanings that a machine can grasp. If legal verbiaqe still eludes the machine, it can simply phrase its advice in the form ""if you think he is 'of good character' then this law applies, otherwise that law does"".
In a sense, such practical solutions solve the problem by flipping it on its head. Instead of teaching machines the full meaning of words, people simply agree to work with meanings that the machines can understand. This alters the way in which words develop their meanings in the first place. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition of common law, at least, many words are left vague on purpose so that they can be redefined in the courtroom by a jury, thus helping the law to evolve in step with society.
NEW WORLD
Had the quest for AI-succeeded in creating artificial people, getting machines to do jobs that are now done by people would have had little impact on anything except the economics of employment. Instead, it is doing something more revolutionary. To the extent that AI, together with the rest of information technology, has created tools worth using, it is starting to cause a deeper social transformation, by affecting the flow of information and ideas by which people define their culture.
Such change is not without precedent. Books and television have transformed the flow of information. The industrial revolution transformed work by applying machinery. But just as the industrial revolution was marked by a long apprenticeship of learning how to share work with machines, so too will the decades ahead be marked by a long apprenticeship of learning how to share information and decision-making with machines.
In the law, for example, the convenience of quicker, more predictable decision-making by computer may be worth the price of fewer arguments in the court room. Continental European countries have for centuries lived with a system of administrative law, derived from Roman tradition, in which juries and case law have little role to play. But learning how to make decisions in harmony with other people is hard enough; learning how to share decision-making with a machine is harder still. To glimpse some of the pitfalls that lie ahead, look at hospitals.
In many parts of medicine, computers have been doing better than doctors on tests of diagnostic ability for nearly two decades. But no hospital relies on a computer in diagnosis. One problem, points out Peter Szolovits of MIT, is that good performance on average is not enough in medicine. It is no good being brilliant on 96% of your patients if you stupidly kill the other 4%. The narrow abilities of today's artificial intelligences provide no firm guarantees that they will not do that.
One practical solution might be to put computers to work advising doctors, so that the doctor can make sure that the computer does not do anything stupid and vice versa. Here a more fundamental problem arises: time. Dr Szolovits recalls demonstrating an expert system to a heart specialist. The doctor was impressed by the computer's capabilities, but pointed out that he had spent 25 minutes typing questions and data into the machine for each case--and he saw 30-40 patients a day. Although a doctor's assistant might have more time to do the typing, he lacks the knowledge to take advantage of the machine's capabilities. He cannot know when to ask questions, which questions to ask or when to challenge the machine's assumptions.
Despite these pitfalls, the allure of AI is strong enough for the technology to be making gradual headway in hospitals--particularly in the role of error-catcher, looking at orders r treatment filed electronically by doctors into a hospital database and warning of potential hazards. But the medical history of AI highlights an uncomfortable fact: that the greatest obstacle to more intelligent machines is unintelligent people. Much though computer companies would like to promote the illusion that owning a clever, powerful computer will somehow make you a cleverer, more powerful person, it will not. However full of answers an artificial intelligence may be, it is of limited use to someone who does not understand the questions in the first place.
The history of science is filled with illustrations of the principle that intelligence is in large par in the eye of the beholder. Just as scientists have rejected theories whose importance or workings they could not understand, so too will people reject machines that do not speak their language. AI has a bright future in promoting human intellience--helping with deductions, providing memory aids, detail-handlers, tutors and so on. But neither people nor machines can provide answers better than the questions they are asked. It is up to people to make sure that the questions are good ones."
21-Mar-92,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224163007/fulltext/771109CF658E4B17PQ/1?accountid=14657,"Will Richard Milanovich one day rank alongside Bugsy Siegel, the founder of Las Vegas? Mr Milanovich is the chairman of the Agua Caliente, a small tribe of Indians who own a large part of Palm Springs. The tribe recently voted 85 to 24 to exploit a federal law which allows gambling on Indian land. just over half of America's 280 reservations now have casinos of some sort. Mr Milanovich has received offers from 30 prospective partners, including several big Las Vegas groups. A casino promises revenues of up to $60m for the tribe, and jobs for the depressed local tourist industry.
However, many of Mr Milanovich's neighbours are worried. Sonny Bono, the colourful ex-mayor of Palm Springs and ex-husband of Cher, points out that the casino ""could be a bucket of worms that opens up a lot of lawsuits."" Local leaders, most of whom favour the casino in principle, disagree with Mr Bono; but they also wish that the town had some say in the matter.
The casino in Palm Springs will probably be a flagship for the Indian gambling business. Nationally, Indian revenues from gaming are now close to the $1.4 billion the Bureau of Indian Affairs spends on tribal services. Any spare cash is welcome; unemployment rates in Indian communities are often over 50%. Nelson Rose, a professor who specialises in gambling law, hails the casinos as ""the biggest economic advance for the Indians in three centuries."" Even the wealthy and well-managed Agua Caliente claim to be land-rich but cash-poor.
Indian gambling, nonetheless, still has a mixed reputation. Successful tribes such as the Seminole, who own a casino on the outskirts of Miami, attract less attention than those who fail. Adventures in gambling by the Mohawk tribe of New York have led to murder, theft and brushes with the Mafia. The 30-strong Cabazon tribe, whose casino at Indio (just down the road from Palm Springs) takes in revenues of $32m, has also been involved in lawsuits and scandal.
At the root ot the problem is the awkward legal status of Indian gambling. Federal law allows Indians to offer versions of gambling that are ""not specifically prohibited"" in other parts of a state. Nearly a third of states allow charities to have Las Vegas nights twice a year with strictly regulated maximum bets; that means Indians can hold Las Vegas nights every night with much larger maximum bets. Indians have also taken advantage of all the state laws which allow state lotteries. Only Utah and Hawaii ban gambling completely.
Most of the Indian ""casinos"" would not entice James Bond. Little more than glorified bingo halls, they usually allow poker; but blackjack is banned. In most states, slot machines, the source of nearly half the income of Las Vegas casinos, are illegal. Indian casinos have invented video ""pull-tab"" machines, which are technically forms of bingo but look like slot machines and make the same noises when the punter wins: the state of California, among others, is trying to ban them.
Making a go of the casinos is harder than it looks, even if the Indians get honest advice. Much depends on the site. The most prosperous reservations in Connecticut, Florida and California are all within reach of big cities.
Until recently Las Vegas and Atlantic City paid little attention to the Indians. Indeed, because Indian gambling was so unregulated, no big Las Vegas operation was prepared to risk its Nevada license to go into partnership with the tribes. But Las Vegas casinos have completed recent deals with Indians in Kansas and Washington. Mr Rose predicts that, eventually, most of the biggest Indian operations will be run by big gambling companies. Southern California, which supplies 80% of Las Vegas's customers, represents the most serious threat so far; Palm Springs is two hours closer to Los Angeles than Las Vegas.
In Palm Springs itself, Mr Milanovich insists that most of the key points about the casino, including its site, will be decided by the tribe, not the town. His early plans include some form of upmarket entertainment centre--""like Las Vegas, but without the garishness"". If it fails to please, Mr Bono wants a referendum that would allow the town to start its own casino in competition. Indeed, the real threat to Indian gambling may prove to be competition rather than corruption. Gambling's reputation as a goldmine is based on its rarity. A bill in California's state legislature in Sacramento would allow gambling within 10 miles of the Nevadan border. Nearly every state with a waterway is now promoting riverboat gambling, while Colorado is looking to gambling to revive its old mountain towns (see box). Meanwhile, some states, including Washington and Wisconsin, have looked at measures to ban Indian casinos.
Many Indian leaders feel that the issue is coming to a head. Some compare gambling with the land rights, later rescinded, that their ancestors were promised by the federal government. Mr Milanovich is convinced that politicians will eventually either ""overregulate"" the Indians out of gambling or grant outsiders the same rights. Either way, the effect will be felt in Las Vegas as well as Palm Springs.
ONE GOOD HAND TOO MANY
Cripple Creek, Colorado
Even the greediest residents of Palm Springs would be well advised to avoid Cripple Creek. Since October 1991, the sleepy old Colorado mining town has been transformed. A state referendum the year before had allowed Cripple Creek and two other mountain towns, Black Hawk and Central City, to introduce gambling. Now there are echoes of the Great Stampede of 1890, when Bob Womack, prospecting down the way in Poverty Gulch, discovered gold.
More than a dozen casinos have opened in Cripple Creek, sporting names like Bronco Billy's and Lucky Lola's. A big crane now dominates the town's central street. Many of the remaining shops are being hollowed out to make room for more gaming parlours. Where once a handful of tourists strolled, it is now elbow-room only for slot-machine punters from Denver.
So far, most locals are too busy counting their money to bother about aesthetics. House prices have soared, some rising three times or more, as investment has poured into the area. One Los Angeles developer alone has spent $45m on casinos in the three mountain towns. But some local shopkeepers complain that the visitors spend all their money at the tables.
A blacker cloud has appeared on the horizon: jealousy. More than 30 Colorado towns are now talking of introducing gambling. Not all of them have Cripple Creek's charm (or what remains of it), but many are closer to Denver. Attempts to put a two-year moratorium on new gambling towns have so far failed. Bob Womack, who died penniless in 1909, may yet be chuckling in his grave."
